'''...Maybe One More.''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by duplicating the same item 7 times in a row with a [[3D Printers|3D Printer]].

==Tips==
* Even though it is possible to use a 3D Printer with the same item over and over, such as turning Syringes into Syringes, it is required that the item given to the Printer differs from the item received in order to count toward the seven duplications needed.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''. It is completed by finishing the [[Void Fields]], a Hidden Realm found by activating the [[Null Portal]] in the [[Bazaar Between Time]].

Under the Bazaar in the Bazaar Between Time, there is a hidden cave that leads to a purple portal, which leads to the Void Fields. Beating the 9 challenge cells in the Void Fields will clear the challenge and unlock {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Acrid}} as a playable [[Survivors|Survivor]].

== Version History ==

** Added New Challenge: ...To Be Left Alone
}}

== Trivia ==

* The name of this challenge refers to the ending quote from the original Risk of Rain when completing the game as Acrid. The entire quote is "''...and so it left, with a new hunger: to be left alone."''
** This also references the fact that the Acrid seen in the original Risk of Rain is the same one seen in Risk of Rain 2, which isn't the case for any other Survivor.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are [[Interactables]] that spawn on all common [[Environments]]. These large machines can destroy one item given by a player to print a new one. They allow players to have some control over their items and, by extension, their build.

If the player interacts with the printer, it destroys 1 random item in the player's inventory that is the same rarity as the displayed item, then drops 1 copy of that displayed item. If the player has any Scrap of the corresponding rarity, the Scrap is guaranteed to be destroyed before any other item. ''(See the [[Scrapper]] page for more information about Scraps).''

A 3D Printer can be interacted with indefinitely, as long as the player is willing to transform their items. Once the player has nothing but the item to be printed in their inventory, further interactions with the printer will simply replace the item with a copy of itself. This is generally not very useful, but can be used to generate a random item with the help of a {{ItemLink|Recycler}}, or to give copies of the item to fellow players in multiplayer.

Printing items should be done carefully: converting too many items can unbalance a player's build and become more detrimental than beneficial.

== Notes ==
* 3D Printers will not spawn with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} active.
* It is possible for 3D Printers to spawn close enough to bottomless pits that any printed items will fall into the pit and be lost.
* If a player is holding {{ItemLink|Eulogy Zero}}, the item in a 3D Printer can be replaced with a random [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] while the cost of using the 3D Printer remains unaffected. This means that players can very easily get a high number of stacks of lunar items, rather than purchasing them by spending [[Lunar Coins]].
* 3D printers will never offer {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, White|}}{{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Green|}}{{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Red|}}{{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Yellow|}}{{ItemLink|Regenerating Scrap|}} scraps.

The '''57 Leaf Clover''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The Clover makes random beneficial effects more likely to occur for the holder, and as such is the counterpart to the {{ItemLink|Purity}} (which makes beneficial effects ''less'' likely to occur). It affects all random item effects except {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, {{ItemLink|Breaching Fin}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Noxious Thorn}}. 

If a successful proc is not achieved on a roll, it will be rolled one additional time per Clover. For example, assume the player has one item that has a 20% chance to proc a beneficial effect on-hit, and has one 57 Leaf Clover. If the player attacks, and the item does not activate, the roll will be done once more, as the player has one Clover. 

Successes are measured per effect, not as a whole. If one item roll is successful, other items that were triggered by the same proc will continue to roll if unsuccessful.

Since items from chests are created based on the world seed, the Clover does ''not'' affect them.

==Math==
In order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers, the following equation can be used:

&lt;code&gt;y = 1 - (1 - p)^(x + 1)&lt;/code&gt;

Where:
*''p'' = total item proc chance (between 0 and 1)
*''x'' = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.
*''y'' = new item proc chance (between 0 and 1) with ''x'' amount of Clovers.

The inverse of the equation, to find the number of Clovers required to achieve a certain proc probability, is:

&lt;code&gt;x = (log(1 - y) / log(1 - p)) - 1&lt;/code&gt;

Note that this is a logarithmic equation. As such, it is impossible to achieve 100% proc chance on an effect (regardless of the number of Clovers held), unless the base chance is already 100%.

In order to calculate proc probability with a certain number of Clovers and a certain number of times a proc chance is rolled, the following equation can be used:

&lt;code&gt;y = 1 - ((1 - p)^(x + 1))^t&lt;/code&gt;

Where:
*''p'' = total proc chance (between 0 and 1)
*''x'' = the number of Clovers in the player's inventory.
*''t'' = the amount of times a proc chance is rolled.
*''y'' = new proc chance (between 0 and 1) with ''x'' amount of Clovers and ''t'' amount of times the proc chance is rolled.
This equation is useful for calculating logbook drop chances for multi-phase bosses, like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}}, or more uncommon enemies, like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Overloading Worm|altText=Overloading Worms}}.

==Interaction with Purity==
In the game code, the number of Clovers is referred to as "Luck," with each Clover giving +1 Luck. There are no other means of acquiring positive Luck. Negative Luck is also supported, and can be obtained via the [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] {{ItemLink|Purity}}. Positive and negative Luck will cancel each other out, and thus an equal number of Clovers and Purity will equate to 0 Luck.

The game runs a proc chance &lt;code&gt;Abs(Luck)&lt;/code&gt; times, where Luck is the total amount after Clovers (positive) &amp; Purities (negative) are applied.

If the player has 7 Clovers and 5 Purity, the 5 Purity will cancel out 5 of the Clovers, resulting in a net +2 Luck. This means any given proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a ''positive'' outcome. If the amount of each item is switched, resulting in -2 Luck, the proc chance will be rolled two additional times for a ''negative'' outcome; this can also be seen as the proc chance needing to ''successfully'' roll three times for it to proc (once for the initial roll and two more for each negative Luck).

==Exhaustive List of Clover Effects==
Luck does ''not'' affect chest spawns or contents, [[Shrine of Chance]] outcomes, the chance for an {{ItemLink|Artifact Key}} to drop, or the chance for monsters to drop items with the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} enabled.

==Trivia==
* The 57 Leaf Clover is the successor to the [[ror:56 Leaf Clover|56 Leaf Clover]] from the first ''Risk of Rain''. The 56 Leaf Clover did not interact with chance effects, but instead gave a chance for Elite monsters to drop random items upon defeat. 
**This behavior is partially carried over to ''Risk of Rain 2'', as the 57 Leaf Clover affects the chance for Elite monsters to drop their Elite equipment.
* Before the Artifacts update, the unreleased code for the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} would check for the Luck of the killer. '''''This is no longer the case'''''.
* Before the full release of Risk of Rain 2, {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} and {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} were affected by the Luck stat, and therefore were more likely to proc when the player had a Clover. This is no longer the case, as the 1.0 update revamped both Bands.
**An interesting leftover of this design change is that Kjaro and Runald, the two {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Elder Lemurian|altText=Elder Lemurians}} who spawn with the Bands in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Abandoned Aqueduct}}, also both spawn with 20 stacks of 57 Leaf Clovers.
*For every frame that the Clover's effect is triggered at least once, a chime sound can be heard. This is hard to notice when striking an enemy, but it can also be triggered when the player takes damage while holding a {{ItemLink|itemName=Razorwire}}, since the item will roll for [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] before searching for valid targets. As such, being under the effect of the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Void Fog}} makes this more noticeable.

'''A Moment, Fractured''' is a Hidden Realm [[Environments|Environment]]. It features multiple floating islands in a void, with sharp blue crystals embedded in them. As the player drops down, a path of glowing blue rocks will appear between each island, leading the player to the last area. The Obelisk can be found on top of the last island.

This stage can only be reached via the Celestial Portal, which spawns on every [[Environments#Third Stages|third stage]] after the first loop next to the [[Teleporter]].

== Celestial Portal ==
[[File:Celestial Portal.jpg|thumb|A Celestial portal on Scorched Acres]]
The Celestial Portal is a portal that teleports to A Moment, Fractured. To have one spawn, the player must have [[Environments#Looping|looped]] at least once and reached the 3rd stage. On this stage, a Celestial Orb will spawn circling the Teleporter. After completing the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], the Celestial Portal will spawn.

{{Clear}}

==Obelisk==
[[File:Activated Obelisk.jpg|thumb|Activated Obelisk and Celestial portal]]
The Obelisk is an [[Interactables|interactable]] found on the last floating island. It takes the shape of two gigantic, slab-shaped monoliths which extend upwards for around 30 meters where a circular cavity is present. When activated, this cavity is filled by a ball of brilliant blue light.

The player can interact with the Obelisk, being prompted if they want to obliterate themself from existence, then being asked again if they are sure. Doing so the second time will end the run for ''all players'', while also giving each 5 [[Lunar Coins]].

If any player has a {{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty}}, the run will not end; instead all players will be teleported to the Hidden Realm {{EntityLink|entityName=A Moment, Whole}}.

If the player wants to continue the run, a portal will spawn below and to the right of the Obelisk upon approaching it.

Obliterating for the first time will complete the [[True Respite]] challenge, which unlocks the character {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, while obliterating with any [[Survivors|Survivor]] on {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}} difficulty completes their Mastery challenge, unlocking that Survivor's alternate skin.

{{Clear}}
== Logbook Entry ==
[[File:A Moment, Fractured - Environment Log.jpg|thumb|Environment Log location]]
The Environment Log can be found right underneath the starting platform.  It will disappear 5 minutes after entering the level.

{{Clear}}
== Secrets ==
Before jumping down on the platform the player spawns on, turn left and walk up the angled planks. Three islands are visible in the distance against the backdrop if the gamma is turned up. Two of these islands contain literal hidden Easter Eggs.

=== Getting to the Easter Eggs ===
If the player uses {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}} alongside multiple {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, the player can fly over to both islands to the left. {{ItemLink|Wax Quail|altText=Wax Quails}} will help to get horizontal momentum to travel the distance.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Environments#Hidden Realms|hidden realm]] added in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''. It can be reached from [[A Moment, Fractured]], by obliterating at the [[A Moment, Fractured#Obelisk|Obelisk]] while at least one player holds the {{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty}}.

Here, the player confronts one of the {{MonsterLink|Kipkip the Gentle|}}{{MonsterLink|Wipwip the Wild|}}{{MonsterLink|Twiptwip the Devotee|}}{{MonsterLink|Guragura the Lucky|}}[[Twisted Scavenger]] bosses. The main purpose of fighting it is to obtain [[Lunar Coins|lunar coins]] and complete the current run.

There is no way to exit the stage other than killing the Twisted Scavenger, or being killed.

== Twisted Scavenger ==
[[File:Twisted Scavenger Reward.png|thumb|The boss drop]]
One of four Twisted Scavengers will be sitting in front of the player.
{{MonsterList}}

Upon killing the Twisted Scavenger, it will drop its sack and the screen will start to go black. Opening the sack will drop {{LunarCoin|10}}, which must be collected before the screen turns black, or they are lost.

Defeating the Twisted Scavenger with any [[Survivors|Survivor]] on {{EntityLink|Monsoon}} also completes their Mastery challenge, which unlocks that Survivor's skin.

{{Clear}}

== Logbook Entry ==
[[File:A Moment, Whole - Environment Log.jpg|thumb|Environment Log location]]
The Environment Log is located behind the Twisted Scavenger, at the opposite side from where the player spawns, behind a grave-like stone. 

It is recommended to pick up the Log before the fight, due to the blackout that occurs after defeating the Scavenger. Furthermore, it will disappear 5 minutes after entering the level.

{{Clear}}
== Notes ==
* Defeating the Twisted Scavenger(s) counts as obliterating, however, dying to the Twisted Scavenger(s) will not count. This is an important note on Monsoon difficulty when trying to unlock the Mastery challenge.
* Reaching the edge of the stage will warp the player back to the main area, but this does not happen for enemies. Pushing a Twisted Scavenger to the edge of the map will cause it to instantly die as if they had fallen off the map, and its sack of coins will be warped to the main area to be looted.
* Going to this area will count towards {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} [[Captain: Wanderlust|Wanderlust]] challenge.

[[File:Abandoned aqueduct logbook.png|200px|thumb|Adandoned Aqueduct logbook diorama]]
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an arid, sprawling desert located on [[Petrichor V]] and is a Stage 2 [[Environments|Environment]] encountered in ''Risk of Rain 2''.

Massive skeletons and pools of tar are littered around, and a towering aqueduct pouring down tar dominates the area.

== Interactables==
{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters==
{{MonsterList}}

NOTE: Elder Lemurians do not spawn naturally, nonetheless 2 can be found upon accessing the [[#Hidden Chamber|Hidden Chamber]].

==Hidden Chamber==
The '''Hidden Chamber''' necessary for the completion of the '''[[Death Do Us Part]]''' [[Challenges|Challenge]] is locked behind the '''Ancient Gate''' located in the sandy hills outside of the central aqueduct walls, just behind the large tar pit. To open the gate, two '''Pressure Plates''' must be found and triggered. These '''Pressure Plates''' spawn in two of eight different locations throughout the level, and can be located using the {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}} through which they are marked with a '''?''' icon.

Both plates must be activated and held down at the same time, whether by multiple players or weighted objects such as: 
*Explosive Tar Pots
*{{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Engineer's turrets}}
*{{SkillLink|M551 Pylon|Loader|Loader's M551 Pylon}}
*{{SkillLink|Orbital Supply Beacon|Captain|Captain's Orbital Supply Beacon}}
*{{ItemLink|Effigy of Grief}}.
*[[Lunar Coins]] (can be position via spawning from a {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}})
Despite its weighty appearance and similarity to other skills, {{ItemLink|itemName=Remote Caffeinator}} does not trigger the plates.

===Pot Rolling===
Explosive Tar Pots can be moved on top of pressure plates through the use of 'Pot-rolling'. This involves using the player character's hitbox to shove the pots around the level. Sprinting toward a pot from behind is the most consistent way to achieve this. Note that aiming directly at the pot is fairly ineffective, instead aim to "brush off" the side of the pot while sprinting. If a pot lands perfectly upright or upside down, simply stand directly on top of the pot, then sprint off, this will fling the pot slightly towards the same direction. It is highly advised to only try moving pots ''after'' completing a teleporter, as monster projectiles will very likely destroy them.

There are specific 'pot-rolling' strategies that are survivor or item specific:

*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}} can use their Utility skills to effectively fling pots. This is achieved by using the respective skill while walking (not sprinting) towards a pot at an angle.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}} can use {{SkillLink|skillName=Tactical Slide}} in a similar fashion. Simply use the skill while aiming at the pot from a close distance.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} can use {{SkillLink|skillName=Concussion Device}} to launch pots by a significant distance. However, the angle and strength of the launch can vary greatly depending on the exact placement of the skill, hence it is fairly easy to unintentionally launch a pot too far, thus losing time.
* Activating {{ItemLink|itemName=Primordial Cube}} can help transport pots great distances and scale vertical cliffs.

===The Ancient Gate ===
When both plates are activated, the '''Ancient Gate''' will open and the tunnel to the '''Hidden Chamber''' may be entered. Inside are two unique Elite {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians}}; Kjaro and Runald. Upon their death, they will drop a {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} and a {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} respectively, and will complete the challenge '''[[Death Do Us Part]]''' which allows both items to drop in future runs.

==Newt Altars==
There 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and excluding the guaranteed spawn, 0-2 will randomly from the rest:
# High ledge across from Ancient Gate and sand pit
#On top of an aqueduct wall
#In fossil head skull (on very top of the map)

==Trivia==
*The two {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians}} have 3000% HP and start with 20 {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} alongside a copy of their respective band. They do not scale with the ambient level and do not gain the same damage bonus as regular elites.
**The reason behind the clovers is  {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} and  {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} used to be chance based items, which the absurd clover count would cause to trigger virtually every hit. Post-rework, all of these items are entirely redundant and serve no purpose (unless {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} is enabled) as Elder Lemurian's attacks cannot even trigger the bands effects. As such, both Lemurians are nothing more than Elites with odd stats.

[[File:Abyssal depths logbook.png|thumb|Abyssal Depths logbook diorama]]
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are located within the crust of [[Petrichor V]], and is a part of the fourth set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2''.

A hellfire-forged zone of blazing heat, the Abyssal Depths are believed to be a continuation and adaptation of the [[ror:Magma Barracks|Magma Barracks]] from ''Risk of Rain''.

The stage features two vault doors leading to a cave, which are either closed or open. If they are open, then the stage will obtain 160 extra credits to spawn more [[Interactables]] (roughly 10 small chests).

==Interactables==

==Monsters==

==Notes==
* All Multishop Terminals that spawn will be of {{Color|uncommon|uncommon}} rarity.
* [[Shrine of Blood|Shrines of Blood]] will not spawn on this stage.

==Legendary Chest==
A [[Chests#Legendary Chest|Legendary Chest]] will always spawn in the center of the environment, nestled between the rock faces in a nook behind some plants.

A broken robot can be found on the high up platforms of the stage. Interacting with it while equipped with a {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}} will complete the [[Power Plant]] challenge and unlock {{SurvivorLink|REX}} as a playable survivor.

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and exactly 1 will spawn: 
#Atop the hanging orange crystal in the center of the environment
#Corner of the third elevation level near the chain impalement
#Within a cluster of yellow crystals within the cave, which is only sometime accessible though the intentional means. 
#* Can be accessed regardless by following the drop-down path entrance until the door and simply leaping over it with any movement abilities

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

An imposingly large, poison-spewing ex-prisoner, Acrid fights with a potent array of damage-over-time effects and a self-sustaining melee ability. In addition to sporting the highest base damage stat of any Survivor barring the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}, Acrid’s mix of long-range and crowd control allow for excellent damage potential.

Acrid's unique ability to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Poisoned}} or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Blight}} [[Status Effects|status effects]] makes it an incredibly lethal choice when stacking [[items]] that inflict additional debuffs.

Completing the [[...To Be Left Alone]] challenge will unlock Acrid as a playable survivor.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use utility (leap away from enemy)''': Acrid must be within 5m of the target and aiming at it. Acrid will sprint and reselect a target after this.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': Acrid must be 3m from the target. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds and a new target will be selected after this.
# '''Use utility (leap towards enemy)''': Acrid must be within 10-20m from the target, have line of sight, and aiming at it. Acrid will sprint and reselect a target after this.
# '''Use primary and chase''': Acrid must be within 6m from the target. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds and a new target will be selected after this.
# '''Use special''': Acrid must be within 30m from the target, have line of sight, and aiming at it.
# '''Use secondary''': Acrid must be within 30m from the target, have line of sight, and aiming at it. This behavior does not differentiate between the Spit and the Bite and as such the Bite will be needlessly used even if the target is not within melee range.
# Chase: no requirements.

== Tips ==
* Choosing between {{Color|h|Poison}} and {{Color|d|Blight}} is largely a personal preference.
** Since {{Color|h|Poison}} cannot stack, it favors a dodgier, fire-and-forget playstyle where the player poisons a group of enemies, leaves them to take damage, and finds some new enemies to poison in the meantime.
** On the other hand, {{Color|d|Blight}} favors an aggressive playstyle and rewards using more skills, as each {{keyword|h|Poisonous}} skill effectively deals 320% more base damage.
*** The main drawback to {{Color|d|Blight}} is that its duration is not reset for each stack unlike bleed for example. This places a soft cap on {{Color|d|Blight}}'s damage potential without the use of cooldown reduction items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Purity}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Lysate Cell}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Alien Head}} for example. This is the biggest drawback to {{Color|d|Blight}}.
* The [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage]] from both {{Color|h|Poison}} and {{Color|d|Blight}} can be increased with {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}},  {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}, {{ItemLink|Death Mark}}, {{ItemLink|Shattering Justice}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Symbiotic Scorpion}}, {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} and {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}} directly affect base damage and therefore will ''not'' increase the maximum health damage of {{Color|h|Poison}}, instead only increasing its minimum base damage. Other damage-boosting items will however, as they are applied ''after'' {{Color|h|Poison}} has already calculated its own damage.
*Although the percentage-based damage of {{Color|h|Poison}} may seem appealing on paper, in practice it will only reach its maximum damage against the very largest of enemies. Experiment with both {{Color|h|Poison}} and {{Color|d|Blight}} to determine which aligns better with preferred playstyles.
**It is straightforward to determine when {{Color|h|Poison}} is dealing the least possible damage by observing the damage dealt by each tick. If the damage per tick is {{Color|acrid|Acrid's}} level plus 4, then the victim's maximum HP is so low that {{Color|h|Poison}} is only dealing the minimum 100% base damage per second (lower than 2 stacks of {{Color|d|Blight}}). This observation can be muddled by the aforementioned damage-boosting items, however.
*Since the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=CrocoRegen}} buff from {{Color|acrid|Vicious Wounds}} and {{Color|acrid|Ravenous Bite}} is considered health regeneration, it will be massively amplified by {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}. However, this also means that it will not interact with items like {{ItemLink|Aegis}}, {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} or {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}.
**Despite being regeneration, it is not affected by the regeneration modifiers from {{EntityLink|entityName=Drizzle}} or {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}}, and is not removed when {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=on fire}}.
*Getting a {{ItemLink|itemName=Purity}} reduces the cooldown of {{Color|acrid|Neurotoxin}} and {{Color|acrid|Ravenous Bite}} to the minimum of 0.5 seconds. This enables {{Color|acrid|Acrid}} to rapidly fire off ranged attacks, or to repeatedly bite enemies and regenerate massive amounts of health.
*{{Color|acrid|Vicious Wounds'}} attack animation can be cancelled and reset by initiating a sprint. This allows {{Color|acrid|Acrid}} to attack extremely quickly with no items. In [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/1688218948651814638 Development Thoughts #11] it was noted this behavior will likely get removed.
**This does not reset {{Color|acrid|Acrid}}'s 3-hit combo, potentially allowing it to regenerate at a greatly increased rate.
*{{Color|acrid|Epidemic}} gives {{Color|acrid|Acrid}} great early-game area-of-effect damage. Even late-game, it can be competent at activating on-hit items like the {{ItemLink|Ukulele}} and {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} due to its 1.0 proc coefficient and how it quickly spreads through crowds of enemies.
*Intentionally shooting {{Color|acrid|Epidemic}} at the floor or walls can reliably hit flying monsters such as {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisps}}.
*{{Color|acrid|Acrid}} does not spawn from an [[Escape Pod]], making {{Color|acrid|Acrid}} unable to unlock [[Power Plant]] in a single-player run.

==Trivia==
*Acrid is the only returning character that is the same creature in both Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2.
*The challenge necessary to unlock Acrid, "...To be left alone" is a reference to Acrid's victory screen from the first Risk of Rain, which reads "...And so it left, with a new hunger: to be left alone."
*Acrid is referred to internally as "Croco," and the Regenerative buff is referred to as "CrocoRegen."
*Acrid is commonly known as “Poison Doggo” as an internet meme.
* Instead of starting in an Escape Pod, Acrid starts asleep on the surface of the planet. During its wake up animation, it is actually vulnerable to enemy attack before the player is given control if its spawn location is particularly unlucky.
*Acrid originally fell onto Petrichor V, along with the majority of the UES ''Contact Light'''s cargo, locked inside of a crate that landed atop the area known as [[ror:Sunken Tomb|Sunken Tomb]]. It can be presumed that void creatures managed to imprison it in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}} between the events of ''Risk of Rain'' 1 and 2.
*Although Acrid somewhat resembles a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lemurian}}, it has been confirmed by developer Hopoo that it is ''not'' a Lemurian.
*Epidemic's enemy limit is completely unfeasible to reach under normal gameplay circumstances; since it spreads to 2 enemies at a time, up to 20 times, it can affect a total of 1 + 2^20 = 1048577 enemies. For comparison, the maximum number of monsters that can exist at once is 40.
*The last few lines of Acrid’s Logbook may reference the Void Fiend Escaping the Void, as its considerable power could definitely cause a panic as it was definitely ready for vengeance. 
*The way Acrid spawns on the 1st stage may actually be a reference to the way he is Unlocked. By clearing the Void Fields, you set Acrid free, and, since being in a prison, Acrid would have nothing better to do than sleep, so when you set him free, he is teleported to the surface, mid nap, and wakes up  
*The word Acrid means "having an irritatingly strong and unpleasant taste or smell".
*Acrid is one of three survivors with multiple sets of pronouns, using he/it, the other being [[REX]] and [[Heretic]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} by killing 50 [[Monsters|enemies]] while they only have 1 HP left.

This is easily accomplished by {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Poisoned|altText=poisoning}} an enemy, then leaving it alone until the poison has removed all but 1 of its HP.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} by inflicting {{SkillLink|Poison|Acrid}} 1000 times.

==Tips==
* Acrid's normal playstyle involves poisoning enemies, so players do not need to do anything particular to complete this challenge.
**If players do wish to speed up the challenge's completion, enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} will give twice as many enemies to poison.
*Killing enemies instantly with an attack that inflicts poison still counts towards this challenge.
* Acrid's alternative passive {{SkillLink|Blight|Acrid}} will ''not'' count toward completing this challenge.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''.

If the holder receives healing while their health is full, they gain [[Health#Barrier|barriers]] equal to 50% (''+50% per stack'') of the healed amount.

== Tips ==
* This item can be used to remove the downside that comes with the {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}}, which normally make all healing items entirely worthless by changing the player's health into shields.
** This does not work with percentage-based healing like {{ItemLink|itemName=Bustling Fungus}} since the Transcendence and Shared Design reduce the Fungus's healing to almost nothing.

* [[Engineer]]’s stationary turrets benefit from a combo of this item and [[Bustling Fungus]], 3+ stacks of Bustling Fungus can increase the turret’s health exponentially (so long as they are placed next to each other), and can provide the player with that same healing gain. Since the turrets will be constantly healing each other, they can become next to unkillable. 

* A critical-oriented healing build with {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}} can allow for easy barrier accumulation.
*Once the player has accumulated enough [[Proc Coefficient#Items|proc items]] to cause a chain reaction, including on-hit healing items like [[Harvester's Scythe]] and [[Leeching Seed]], one single hit can yield a massive burst of incoming healing, thereby making the barrier uptime trivial.
*Because of how frequently {{ItemLink|itemName=Bustling Fungus}} ticks, it is barely not enough to counteract the barrier decay with 2 stacks. But with 3+ stacks, there will be a positive accumulation of barrier. Similarly, 4 or more stacks of {{ItemLink|itemName=Weeping Fungus}} also has the same positive effect.
* For optimal barrier gain in conjunction with {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}, the amount of Aegis and Rejuvenation Racks should be equal, with Aegis taking priority. Optionally, the amount of Aegis can be two higher (but not three) than the amount of Rejuvenation Racks, instead of equal.

The '''Alien Head''' is a [[Ror:Alien Head|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

A player holding the Alien Head has all their skill cooldowns reduced by 25% (''+25% per stack'').

==Notes==

*The cooldown reduction from the Alien Head is calculated ''before'' the flat reduction from the {{ItemLink|Purity}}. For instance, if a player holds 1 Alien Head and 1 Purity, a skill that would normally take 4 seconds to cool down would instead have a 1 second cooldown (-1 second from the Alien Head, then -2 seconds from the Purity).

==Math==
The [[Survivors|skill]] cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;cooldown &amp;sdot; 0.75 ^ amount&lt;/code&gt;

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''. It resembles a black vulture with a humanoid form, similar to that of a Harpy from Greek mythology.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Alloy Vultures initially spawn on the ground, where they are slow-moving. However, they can take flight to receive both increased speed and free-range movement.  

=== Primary: Wind Blade ===
The Alloy Vulture prepares an attack by moving its mouth sideways for 0.2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) before firing a crescent, disk-like blade which moves at 40m/s for 5 seconds and deals 230% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. 

While this attack has an end lag of 1.5 seconds (scaling with attack speed), any attack can interrupt it even itself. Therefore, for all intents and purposes it is only limited by its own cooldown duration, which is 1 second. 

The wind blade can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}. 

=== Utility: Fly/Land ===
If the Alloy Vulture is not flying, it will become airborne and its movement speed increases from 3m/s up to 15m/s.

If the Alloy Vulture is flying, it will find the closest ground node and land slowly land there. It can keep using its primary attack in the meantime.

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second in either state. If the skill is activated while the Alloy Vulture is landing, it will cancel the process and remain airborne.

If the Alloy Vulture is flying and gets stunned, the flying state will be cancelled and it will fall to the ground.

If the Alloy Vulture is flying and gets frozen, the flying state will be preserved, but the vulture will fall to the ground anyway, resulting in the vulture being stuck on the ground while "flying". This odd state will fix itself upon the vulture using the Utility skill again.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use utility (land)''': the Vulture must be within 22m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.1 seconds.
# '''Use utility (fly)''': the Vulture must be at least 40m away from its target. It is not necessary to be grounded, so if the target has moved far away while it's still landing, it can cancel it by activating the skill. Keep in mind the cooldown is 1 second between switching modes.
# '''Use primary''': the Vulture must be within 50m from its target and have line of sight. It will also strafe during this behavior, but it is an extremely brief side step for one frame.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* Stunning a flying Alloy Vulture causes it to fall, making it easier to deal with.

* The Alloy Vulture may be closely related or a spiritual successor to the [[ror:Evolved Lemurian|Evolved Lemurian]], a Risk of Rain 1 monster.
* If the Alloy Vulture is flying when it picks up a {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} the Utility skill will not be replaced with {{SkillLink|Shadowfade}} until it attampts to land. Once the skill gets replaced, the Alloy Vulture will never use it since the AI specifically checks for the Fly and Land skills.
** If all other heresy items are collected without ever landing, the skill will get replaced immediately when turning into the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Boss]] Monster found only in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Siren's Call}} introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''.

The Unit is summoned by destroying 6 {{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture}} egg clusters found throughout the map. A moment after the last eggs are destroyed, the Unit appears. Defeating the Unit will drop a [[Items#Legendary|legendary item]] near the pillar where it spawns, as well as complete the [[Guidance Offline]] challenge and unlock the {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Supercharged Shot ===
This is a buffed up version of the Solus Control Unit's [[Solus Control Unit#Primary: Charged Shot|primary attack]]. It launches 12 orbs in an arc of 60 degrees, within a span of 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and each orb travels at 90m/s. Each addition, each orb upon impact leaves a small circle that pulses 3 times per second for 6 seconds and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50|altText=slows down the target}}. These lingering circles can also be destroyed by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

Each pulse deals 10% per tick and has a proc coefficient of 0.2.

=== Utility: Probe Launch ===
This is exactly the same as the Solus Control Unit's [[Solus Control Unit#Utility: Probe Launch|utility attack]].

=== Special: Supercharged Detonation ===
This is a buffed up version of the Solus Control Unit's [[Solus Control Unit#Special: Charged Detonation|special attack]], but with 3 large circles, each placed within a 30m radius of each target. In addition, the Alloy Worship Unit will gain shields for 100% of its max health for 6 seconds. 

=== Behaviors ===
The Alloy Worship Unit exhibits exactly the same [[Solus Control Unit#Behaviors|behaviors]] as the Solus Control Unit, with the only difference that the '''special''' can be used if the Alloy Worship Unit has fallen below 50% health.

== Tips ==
* Players should stay off the ground for most of the fight, due to the large area that the Alloy Worship Unit can cover with its attacks.
* Destroy{{MonsterLink|Solus Probe|Solus Probes}} shortly after they spawn so they do not become a large problem during the fight.
* Do not underestimate the damage of the Supercharged Shot. It can instantly kill even a high HP player if multiple orbs hit.
** For melee characters such as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} and {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, this attack can be extra dangerous due to the close range of the boss. Be careful when standing on top of the Alloy Worship Unit, as it can prove fatal if the player is caught off-guard.
* Mercenary can knock the Alloy Worship Unit into terrain using {{SkillLink|skillName=Blinding Assault|survivorName=Mercenary}}, dealing severe damage. As of the 1.0 update, this has become more challenging but is still possible.
* Using the pillar at the middle of map, {{SurvivorLink|REX}} can deal heavy damage by attaching {{SkillLink|Tangling Growth|REX}} to the pillar while the Alloy Worship Unit is on the other side. If the Worship Unit is close, Tangling Growth will pull it in and smash it against the pillar.
** The same effect can be accomplished by using {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Disperse|survivorName=}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Bramble Volley|survivorName=}} to push the Worship Unit into terrain, though this is more difficult.
* Because players are slowed while the Supercharged Detonation attack charges, it is strongly recommended to save a movement ability for dodging it. An alternative is to jump high enough to not get hit, provided the player has jump-boosting items.
* Players without meaningful on-hit effects, such as healing or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}, should pause attacking the boss while it gains shields and focus more on dodging the attack.
* Both the orb shot attack and the detonation circle attack can be shot down by {{SurvivorLink|Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|Captain|altImg=Defensive Microbots (Skill)}}, making this a relatively easy fight for him, especially with sufficient attack speed.
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} can instantly execute the Alloy Worship Unit, causing it to drop {{ItemLink|itemName=Empathy Cores}} in addition to the guaranteed [[Items#Legendary|legendary item]] upon its death.

== Notes ==
* Upon defeat, the Alloy Worship Unit will drop a [[Items#Legendary|legendary item]] for each player in the game around the central pillar. The item dropped will be the same for all players. This can be interpreted as the guaranteed legendary item for {{EntityLink|Siren's Call}}, as the other Stage 4 levels {{EntityLink|Abyssal Depths}} and {{EntityLink|Sundered Grove}} both have guaranteed spawn points for a [[Chests#Legendary Chest|Legendary Chest]]: under some rocks on Abyssal Depths and around the map of Sundered Grove.
* Though the boss will show up in the list of objectives for the stage, defeating the Alloy Worship Unit is not required to access the Teleporter and/or Portals of any kind.

== Trivia ==
* The name of this enemy seems to be in reference to the Alloy Vultures, since it is summoned by the destruction of their nests, has Alloy in its name, and its title is the 'Friend of Vultures.' This is further supported by its Lore entry, insinuating that something (almost definitely the Alloy Vultures) decorated and repaired the Alloy Worship Unit prior to becoming what it is currently, hence the name “Alloy Worship Unit” as it was worshipped by the Alloy Vultures.

'''Alloyed Collective''' is the third expansion for Risk of Rain 2. It was revealed on May 9th, and will include 6 new [[Environments]], 2 new [[Survivors]], 7 new [[Drones]] and [[Enemies]], one new Teleporter Boss and one new Final Boss, and 15 more [[Items]].

==Description==
Bring your friends on the adventure! Only one player is required to own Alloyed Collective to enable the monsters, stages, and items to appear in-game for the whole lobby. Players without Alloyed Collective will be unable to select the two new survivors or permanently unlock new items, logbooks, or other content. 

Explore 6 All-New Stages — From cliffside scrapyards to machinery-choked fortresses and buried caverns, each biome pushes deeper into Solus territory with dynamic layouts and environmental threats. 

Master 2 Survivors — One returns. One debuts. Both are built to survive the escalating storm. 

Command 7 Drones — New drone types let you augment your playstyle with some wild abilities. With the help of a new station, you can even modify your drones to suit your needs. 

Fight 7 Enemies — The Solus have been gathering — and building — and planning. Now their creations are hunting you. 

Challenge Massive Bosses — Face a brutal new Teleporter encounter — and a final boss that reshapes the endgame. 

Loot 15 New Items — Expand your arsenal with a new haul of mislaid UES property. 

The Solus Units were never meant to survive. Betrayed and abandoned, they were lost to an unspeakable corruption. Today, those that remain rise from the scrap heaps that once were their allies to seize a future that was stolen from them. Their continued struggle driven by a singular purpose: returning home.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Construct}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Alpha Constructs spawn by rapidly emerging out of the terrain, often starting in their Defensive State until a target is in range. They are completely immobile, acting as stationary turrets, and can spawn on any terrain (including walls and ceilings). 

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Alpha Construct's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks. 

=== Defensive State ===
When out of combat and out of danger, the Alpha Construct remains dormant in a spherical yellow barrier with the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ArmorBoost}} buff.

While in this state, the Alpha Construct is completely immune to targeting by missiles and other items, such as the {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} and the {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}}. It is also immune to {{SurvivorLink|Huntress|Huntresses'}} attacks and {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|Thermal Harpoons}}.

=== Primary: Fire Construct Beam ===
The Alpha Construct charges a laser for 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), before firing a fast projectile traveling at 80m/s in a straight line for 2 second and can ricochet off of terrain. It deals 150% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}. The attack has an end lag of 0.4 seconds, which also scales with attack speed.

This skill has no cooldown and is only limited by the charging and end lag delays.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Alpha Construct must be within 75m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 1 second and the skill is not necessary to be off cooldown, but it will be used as and when it is available. The Alpha Construct will refresh its target at the end of this behavior.
# '''Search for target''': no requirements.

== Notes ==

* Alpha Constructs are completely immune to knockback, even from skills that have high force like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX|altText=REX's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Disperse}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Bramble Volley}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Tangling Growth}}. This means that the {{ItemLink|itemName=Primordial Cube}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Singularity Band}} will not move them.
* Despite being a "construct", they are susceptible to becoming {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} from {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor|altText=Void Infestors}}.

== Tips ==
* Being completely immobile, Alpha Constructs can be safely left alone if they're not an immediate threat.
** This can be useful if the player is overwhelmed and outscaled by enemies, as the more Alpha Constructs that exist on the map, the fewer other enemies can spawn. Leaving a lot of Alpha Constructs alive away from the [[Teleporter]] means it can be charged more safely.
* Alpha Constructs often spawn in large numbers. Combined with their unpredictable spawn locations, it can end up with the player being pelted from all directions if not dealt with quickly.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the [[Interactables#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is a rare and expensive Shrine that can spawn on any map and on any stage count, except the first stage. Upon purchase, it will spawn a Gold Portal once the [[Teleporter]] has finished charging. Entering this Portal will take the player to the {{EntityLink|Gilded Coast}}.

== Notes ==
* The base cost is $200.
* If multiple Altars of Gold exist on one stage, interacting with one of them will disable the others.
* The Altar of Gold can be interacted with for free with {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Beacon: Hacking|Captain|Hacking Beacon}}.

      <text bytes="39049" sha1="1l7rna9afumzb76rhiw162qqmgnwj22" xml:space="preserve">There are currently 3 alternate game modes that can be played: [[#Prismatic Trials|Prismatic Trials]], [[#Eclipse|Eclipse]] and [[#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]]. Prismatic Trials can only be played solo, while Eclipse and Simulacrum can both be played in multiplayer.

__TOC__

==Prismatic Trials==

The '''Prismatic Trials''' is a special, solo-only game mode where players compete for the fastest time of completing 2 stages. However, to initiate the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], the player must destroy three of a handful of Time Crystals scattered across the map. These crystals explode when destroyed, dealing moderate damage to players and monsters alike. Unlike in standard gameplay, the Teleporter charges instantly once the Teleporter Boss has been defeated. 

Prismatic Trials feature a set of two [[Environments]] on {{EntityLink|Rainstorm}} difficulty, starting cash, and random artifact selections. The only adjustments a player can make are the selected [[Survivors|Survivor]] and their skill loadout.

All items and equipment are considered unlocked and can be encountered in a run, even if they have not been unlocked during a normal run. This is so that everyone competes under the exact same circumstances. This means that player cannot unlock the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}} in this game mode as the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time|altUrl=#Survivor Suspended In Time|altText=crystal}} for unlocking her does not appear. However, the player can still trigger the conditions for achievements they have not yet completed, even though the related item/equipment is already accessible in this game mode.

Similarly, all content introduced with the [[Survivors of the Void]] DLC is enabled, even for non-owners of the DLC.

Prismatic Trials cannot be accessed if the player has installed [[Modding|mods]].

Currently, the Prismatic Trial's only in-game purpose is to unlock {{SkillLink|Slicing Winds|Mercenary}} and {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}.

===Seed===
*Every 3 days (72 hours), a new seed is generated for the Prismatic Trial. This seed is the same for all players, but has different artifacts on console.
*Seeds affect stage rotations, interactables' locations and drops, bosses, monster spawn timing, and activated artifacts.
*Player choices may affect some outcomes of the seed. For example, if the player visits the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}} after the 1st stage, the 2nd stage will have a different spawn location and [[teleporter]] location.
*Seeds are not the same for consoles and PC.

===Notes===
*The second stage boss will always be an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]].
*The in-game time does not stop in {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}.
*While there is no variation between Prismatic Trials and usual scenarios, item drops from the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} are not guaranteed each run.

===Tips===
*Since the [[Monsters|monster]] spawns and item drops from [[interactables]] are the same every playthrough, it is possible to memorize them and create strategies for each Prismatic Trial seed.
*If {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} is the second stage, it is possible to skip the Teleporter event (without destroying Time Crystals or fighting a Teleporter Boss) entirely by submitting an artifact code and entering the artifact portal. 
**If Sky Meadow is the first stage, entering the artifact portal will take the player to the {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}.

==Eclipse==

[[File:Eclipse.png|87px|thumb]]
'''Eclipse''' is an alternate game mode that adds stacking challenge modifiers to successive runs. Each [[Survivors|Survivor]] starts at Eclipse level 1, where playing Eclipse mode as that Survivor will have the first of the modifiers shown below. After successfully completing a run, that Survivor's Eclipse level will increment (up to a maximum of 8), and the next modifier will be added to future runs (in addition to all the modifiers from lower Eclipse levels). Eclipse has the same difficulty settings as {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}}, and [[Challenges]] that require Monsoon can be completed on Eclipse. However, clearing an Eclipse run will not unlock the Survivor's logbook entry. 

#Ally Starting Health: {{Color|hp|-50%}}
#Teleporter Radius: {{Color|hp|-50%}}
#Ally Fall Damage: {{Color|hp|+100% and lethal}}
#Enemy Speed: {{Color|hp|+40%}}
#Ally Healing: {{Color|hp|-50%}}
#Enemy Gold Drops: {{Color|hp|-20%}}
#Enemy Cooldowns: {{Color|hp|-50%}}
#Allies receive {{Color|hp|permanent damage}}. ''"You only celebrate in the light... because I allow it."''

Note: "Ally" includes the player in all cases.

[[A Moment, Fractured#Celestial Portal|Celestial Orbs]] and {{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty}} do not spawn in this game mode, meaning that the only way to complete a run is to fight {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}}. The {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}} is also inaccessible, although the player can still fight {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} after defeating Mithrix by petting the Glass Frog at the starting area of {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} ten times (one Lunar Coin per pet, ten Lunar Coins total), which will lead directly to {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}. Dying to Voidling on Eclipse will not progress the player's Eclipse level and will count as a loss.  

[[Artifacts]] cannot be used in Eclipse, and the [[Sky Meadow#Compound Generator|Artifact Portal]] cannot be spawned.  

Eclipse can be played solo or multiplayer. In multiplayer, the Eclipse level will be set to the lowest level from all Survivors in the lobby.

There are no challenges or unlocks associated with Eclipse; it is strictly a challenge mode to test players' skills, although visual indicators of Eclipse progress will be displayed on the character select screen for the game mode, including a Gold Eclipse icon after completing the Eclipse level on every character. For example, the image below indicates the completion of Eclipse 8 with all characters.

===Eclipse Levels===
{| class="fandom-table"
|-
! Eclipse Level || Modifier || Notes
|-
|[[File:eclipse1.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 1||Ally Starting Health: {{Color|hp|-50%}}||The Eclipse 1 effect starts the Survivor and all allies at half of their maximum health upon spawning, including at the beginning of every stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is ''not'' a reduction to maximum health, only the starting amount.


{{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} completely negates Eclipse 1 due to the fact that Eclipse 1 ignores shields, and so only the player's 1 health will be halved.

While Eclipse 1 does not heavily impact most Survivors, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets' health will be at half every time they are built.
|-
|[[File:eclipse2.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 2||Teleporter Radius: {{Color|hp|-50%}}||The Eclipse 2 effect reduces the radius of the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] by half. Note that this means that the ground area inside the radius is reduced by 75%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This effect includes the radius of the vents in the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} and the Pillars of Soul on {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}, making them a very daunting prospect. It also makes using {{ItemLink|itemName=Focused Convergence}} more challenging.
|-
|[[File:eclipse3.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 3||Ally Fall Damage: {{Color|hp|+100% and lethal}}||The Eclipse 3 effect is identical to the effect of the {{ArtifactLink|Frailty}}.

{{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} trivializes Eclipse 3, since the player's maximum health becomes 1, and therefore the most fall damage they can take becomes 2. Having more than 50% of a character's health be shield will also make fall damage non-lethal assuming full health.

{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} is unaffected due to her {{SkillLink|skillName=Scrap Barrier|survivorName=Loader}} passive.
|-
|[[File:eclipse4.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 4||Enemy Speed: {{Color|hp|+40%}}||The Eclipse 4 effect is essentially the opposite of the {{ItemLink|Chronobauble|altText=Chronobauble's}} effect. Only enemies' movement speed is affected; their attack speed and cooldowns are unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This effect can have some positive effects for the player. Enemies group up faster, and melee enemies (especially {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}) may overshoot their attacks. 
This modifier only applies to enemies on the monster team, so {{Color|void|void}} team enemies (from [[Void Seed]]s, [[Monsters#Voidtouched|Voidtouched]] elites and {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}) are unaffected.
|-
|[[File:eclipse5.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 5||Ally Healing: {{Color|hp|-50%}}||The Eclipse 5 effect applies to all active healing effects (such as {{ItemLink|Medkit}}, {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}, and {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX's}} abilities), as well base health regeneration and items with regeneration effects (such as {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}} or {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}).

{{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} trivializes Eclipse 5, as shields are unaffected by the healing reduction.

Eclipse 5 can be helpful to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}}, as healing will reduce its corruption less, though it will also reduce the amount of healing obtained when using {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppress}}.

{{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}} is impacted ''twice'' by the Eclipse 5 effect: once when the initial healing value is calculated, and once when the healing over time is applied. This makes the Corpsebloom a completely detrimental item on Eclipse 5+ unless the player also carries {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}, as this item cancels out the eclipse modifier in the same way.
|-
|[[File:eclipse6.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 6||Enemy Gold Drops: {{Color|hp|-20%}}||The Eclipse 6 effect reduces [[gold]] dropped from enemies by 20%. Other methods of obtaining gold, such as [[Barrel]]s, {{ItemLink|Ghor's Tome}}, and {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}} are unaffected.

Eclipse 6 can make it so that some enemies on stage 1 will not give any gold upon defeat.
|-
|[[File:eclipse7.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 7||Enemy Cooldowns: {{Color|hp|-50%}}||Eclipse 7 halves all enemy skill cooldowns. Essentially, enemies use their moves twice as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eclipse 7 is especially consequential for the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, which becomes nigh invincible once it starts using Alloy Supercharged Detonation over and over, attaining near-constant shielding. The same idea also applies to the shield of the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Xi Construct}}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some enemies whose attack animations are long are less affected by Eclipse 7; for instance, the {{MonsterLink|Blind Pest}} has a 1s cooldown on its attack (0.5s on Eclipse 7+), but the animation takes 2 seconds to finish. 
This modifier only applies to enemies on the monster team, so {{Color|void|void}} team enemies (from [[Void Seed]]s, [[Monsters#Voidtouched|Voidtouched]] elites and {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}) are unaffected.
|-
|[[File:eclipse8.png|32x32px]] Eclipse 8||Allies receive {{Color|hp|permanent damage}}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ''"You only celebrate in the light... because I allow it."''||The Eclipse 8 effect leaves permanent curses on allies when they suffer damage. When an ally takes damage, they gain a number of stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PermanentCurse}} equal to &lt;code&gt;40 &amp;sdot; Damage / MaxHealth&lt;/code&gt;, rounded down. Maximum health is reduced by a factor of &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.01 &amp;sdot; n&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the number of stacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Contrary to its name, this "permanent" damage is reset at the beginning of every stage. All curse stacks are also removed when resurrecting with {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}}, but ''not'' when using {{ItemLink|Blast Shower}}.

The formula for health reduction is hyperbolic, meaning health lost is not 1% per curse stack/2.5% damage taken. It instead is reduced by much less than this, making this modifier slightly more forgiving than expected.

There is a minimum damage to gain a curse stack of 2.5% of max health, so very small hits will not cause curse and {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}} is still usable. However, all of {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX's}} self-damaging moves ''will'' trigger the permanent damage effect, making REX easily the hardest character on Eclipse 8 on account of having to use most if not all of its non-self damaging abilities, which are considerably weaker than their self damaging counterparts.

=== Tips ===

* Unless [[Benthic Bloom]] is taken, the goal should always be to beat {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} on stage 6, as [[A Moment, Fractured|obliteration]] is disabled for this game mode. As such, your loadout and item choices should be favored towards a single loop short run. For example {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}} may want to equip {{SkillLink|skillName=Strafe}}, due the low chance of gaining large amounts of crit and{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} may want to equip {{SkillLink|skillName=Thunder Gauntlet}}, due to the lack of synergizing items for her default Utility.
* Avoid looping unless your goal isn't to climb eclipse levels. Looping will do nothing but add further challenges to an already difficult run, even if your run stands little chance against the final boss. Taking a chance on the cauldrons and lunar pods on the moon is safer than risking the game scaling too far past your power level while looping.
* The single loop means enemy numbers and strength will generally be weaker than a normal run that loops into the late game; the main obstacles will be Mithrix and the teleporter bosses. Crowd control options should be on much lower priority than single target damage items.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}} can easily handle all enemies during the first loop and can help deal tons of damage to Mithrix, dont be afraid to dump powerful items to get it from a cauldron.
* If a [[scrapper]] appears during stage 5, you should scrap everything that isn't going to help during the final boss; the waves during the last stage shouldn't pose much issue on the first loop and the cauldrons on the last stage can help an otherwise doomed run.
* Getting an item such as an {{ItemLink|itemName=Eccentric Vase}} to skip the pillars on the moon will save both time and potential danger.
* You should save up lunar coins and visit shops when possible as several lunar items are of extra value during an Eclipse run. Learning where Newt Altars can spawn on each stage can help remove potential rng from a run.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Corpsebloom}} is very useful before Eclipse 5 due its short run value and can provide great healing, but should be avoided past the 5th stage due to its downside of limiting healing per second.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} is extremely strong due to most first loop enemies not having the damage to one-shot a player on half health, meaning its downsides rarely matter. Furthermore, E8 usually means taking damage will already lead to failure and that the players one-shot protection will already be nullified. Stacking more than 1 however is quite risky and ill-advised.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} is also a run saver, as the player is almost never going to have enough healing to outpace the value of its shields. It will also completely nullify the modifiers of Eclipse levels 1, 3, and 5. Furthermore trying to out-heal damage will only build up stacks of permanent curse on E8 so its downsides are rarely applicable.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}} is incredibly powerful and the short run duration means you're unlikely to feel the downsides as much. Simply saving it for the teleporter bosses and Mithrix can trivialize the fights.

&lt;span style="opacity: 0%"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="display: none"&gt;Simulacrum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style="vertical-align: 10%"&gt;{{SotV|Void Portal|noTooltip=true}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: 500"&gt; Simulacrum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;hr style="opacity: 20%"&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;

The '''Simulacrum''' is an infinitely scaling wave based alternative game mode that is new to the [[Survivors of the Void]] [[Survivors of the Void Update|update]] and DLC.

Upon entering the game, players will spawn next to the Assessment Focus inside of a small cylinder (extending from the ground to the skybox) which protects them from the deadly [[Void Fog]]. Upon interacting with the Focus, the bubble expands to a radius of 62m, and the first wave begins. Completing the wave requires killing all the enemies that will spawn. If 60 seconds have passed after the last enemy for the wave has spawned, the bubble will slowly shrink until it disappears. If the Void Fog kills all remaining enemies before the player, the wave will be completed successfully and the bubble will re-expand to its initial size. Upon completion of a wave, a [[Void Potential]] drops for each player and a 10 second timer starts for the next wave. Additionally, all dead players are respawned at the completion of a wave. Special modifiers known as Augments may also (randomly) trigger upon the start of a wave.

Every 5th wave will be a "boss wave", having stronger and more numerous enemies, and, after completion, the Assessment Focus will begin moving to a new location in the current Environment, during which all players must follow it. At the beginning of every 10th wave, the enemies will be granted an item, similar to the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, in a Common-Common-{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}-{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}-{{Color|legendary|Legendary}} cycle. Completing this wave will spawn a portal, transporting players to another Environment. After this, they must once again interact with the Assessment Focus to begin the first wave in that Environment. Since this counts as clearing a stage, and [[Monsters#Malachite|Malachite]] and [[Monsters#Celestine|Celestine]] elites start appearing from stage 6 onwards, they will not spawn before Wave 51.

The Environments have various modifications from their original versions, including missing sections and having additional [[Launch Pads]] to make traversing a stage less deadly to the Void Fog. The Environments can be selected in any random order, and each one can lead to any of the remaining ones, making the same Environment possible with only one intermediate in the between. There are a total of 7 Environments:

*{{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}
*{{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}
*{{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}
*{{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}
*{{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}
*{{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}
*{{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}
Note that Commencement is the only Environment that cannot be chosen for the first stage.

Due to the nature of the game mode, e.g., lack of [[Teleporter]] and drones, there are certain things that cannot occur:
*Other than the special portal to advance to the next Environment, no [[Interactables#Portals|portals]] can spawn
*[[Family Events]] will never happen
* Items that activate during the teleporter event activate during the waves
*Certain items are blacklisted and cannot be obtained, even with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}:
**{{ItemLink|Bundle of Fireworks}}
**{{ItemLink|Squid Polyp}}
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}}
**{{ItemLink|Focused Convergence}}
**{{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty}}
**{{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}

===Interactables===

Each Environment is given 600 credits to spend on interactable spawning. This is independent on the number of players, but they will still be halved with the [[Artifacts#Sacrifice|Artifact of Sacrifice]]. The pool of [[Directors#Spawn Cards|spawn cards]] is more limited, but in contrast to the original game mode, they have no stage requirements, which means that Legendary Chests can spawn as early as stage 1.

The category weights are:

* Chests: 45
* Shrines: 1
* Rare: 0.4
* Printers: 8
* Void Stuff: 3

This means that for each stage one should on average expect the following:

* 27 items (+10 from the wave rewards) (+10 more if one holds the {{ItemLink|itemName=Executive Card}})
* 4-5 equipment
* 2 Void Cradles
* 6% chance for a Legendary chest and 10% for a Mili-Tech Printer to spawn

Do note that on the earlier stages one is very unlikely to accumulate enough gold, or have enough healing and mobility to traverse the void fog safely to fully loot a stage.

===Waves===

Each wave can trigger an '''Augment''' that can determine the monsters that spawn, as well as enable and disable artifacts. The rarity of item you receive can also be determined by an Augment.

'''Common Waves'''

{| class="fandom-table"
|-
!Augment||Weight||Requirement||Effect
|-
|Default||80.0||N/A||N/A
|-
|Augment of Spite ||1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Spite}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Spite}} for that wave.
|-
|Augment of Command|| 1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Command}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} for that wave.
|-
|Augment of Glass||1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} for that wave.
|-
|Augment of Dissonance|| 1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} must be disabled for the run.|| Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} for that wave. 
|-
| Augment of Kin ||1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} for that wave.
|-
|Augment of Frailty||1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Frailty}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Frailty}} for that wave.
|-
|Augment of Soul||1.0 || The {{ArtifactLink|Soul}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Soul}} for that wave.
|-
|Augment of Enigma||1.0||The {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} must be disabled for the run.||Enables the {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} for that wave.
|}


'''Boss Waves'''

{| class="fandom-table"
|-
!Augment||Weight||Requirement||Effect
|-
|Default|| 100.0 ||N/A ||Enemies spawn in greater, stronger amounts. Clearing the wave grants the player a {{Color|uncommon|green orb}}.
|-
|Boss Augment of the Moon||4.0|| N/A|| Enemies spawn in greater, stronger amounts and are guaranteed to be {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} enemies. Clearing the wave grants the player a {{Color|lunar|blue orb}}. 
|-
|Boss Augment of the Void||10.0||N/A||Enemies spawn in greater, stronger amounts and are guaranteed to be {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies. Clearing the wave grants the player a {{Color|void|purple orb}}.
|-
|Boss Augment of the Scavenger ||2.0||Wave 11 or higher.||A {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} spawns by itself and upon being defeated grants the player a {{Color|lunar|blue orb}}. This is likely a bug and it was supposed to grant a {{Color|legendary|red orb}} instead. The reason for this suspicion is the internal name for the red orb implies it's reserved for special bosses and this augment exhibits many such traits, i.e., the wave description mentions a ''special reward'', it's a singular powerful enemy, and it has small chance of occuring with a specific requirement. 
|-
|Boss Augment of Mithrix|| 2.0||Wave 11 or higher.||{{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} spawns by himself and upon being defeated grants the player a {{Color|legendary|red orb}}. Mithrix only uses his phase 1 skills and does not steal items from players.
|}

One orb is dropped for each participating player (alive or dead), but unlike in the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} where the orb has the same 3 items for all players, here each orb selects its items independently.

The reward for the common waves is a white orb with chances:
*88.4% Common
*11.0% {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}
*0.3% {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}
*0.3% {{Color|yellow|Boss}}

The {{Color|uncommon|green orb}} has items with chances:
*84.2% {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}
*7.9% {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}
*7.9% {{Color|yellow|Boss}}

The {{Color|lunar|blue orb}} has items and equipment with chances:
* 100% {{Color|lunar|Lunar}}

The {{Color|void|purple orb}} has {{Color|void|void}} items with chances:  
*79.2% Common
*19.8% {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} 
*0.99% {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}

The {{Color|legendary|red orb}} has items with chances:
*80% {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}
*20% {{Color|yellow|Boss}}

Note that these percentages are actually affected by the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]].

===Mechanics===
This game mode uses its own [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]], which is very similar to the one used in the normal game mode if one sets ''playerCount'' to 1. This makes the formula independent on the number of players:

&lt;math&gt;waveFactor = 1.5 \times wave&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;difficultyFactor = 0.0506 \times difficultyValue&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;coeff = (1 + difficultyFactor \times waveFactor) \times 1.02^{wave}&lt;/math&gt;  

The enemy level is calculated by the standard formula with setting ''playerCount'' to 1:  

&lt;math&gt;enemyLevel = 1 + (coeff - 1) / 0.33&lt;/math&gt;  

The enemy level cap is set to 9999, compared to 99 for the normal mode. It takes 213 waves to reach that on Monsoon difficulty.  

On starting a wave, the [[Directors#The Combat Directors|Combat Director]] gets a total amount of credits equal to:  

&lt;math&gt;totalWaveCredits = baseCredits \times coeff&lt;/math&gt;  

where ''baseCredits'' is the base amount of credits a wave can use. Common waves have 159 credits and boss waves 500 credits respectively.  

There is an initial burst of credits awarded for immediate spawning and the rest are slowly released over a period of time.  

&lt;math&gt;immediateMonsterCredits = immediateCreditsFraction \times totalWaveCredits&lt;/math&gt;  

&lt;math&gt;creditsPerSecond = (1 - immediateCreditsFraction) \times totalWaveCredits / wavePeriodSeconds&lt;/math&gt;  

where:  

*''immediateCreditsFraction'' is the fraction of total wave credits to grant initially. For common waves it's 0.15 and for boss waves 0.3. This is irrelevant for the Boss Augment of the Scavenger/Mithrix, as they don't rely on credits to spawn the explicit enemy monster.
*''wavePeriodSeconds'' is the number of seconds over which the remaining credits will be awarded. For common waves it is 30 seconds and for boss waves 60 seconds. While this places a minimum duration per wave, realistically this is limited by how quickly the director can spend the accumulated credits.

The ''immediateMonsterCredits'' is also what the director will use to set the first spawn of the boss wave to a [[Monsters#Bosses|boss monster]]. Such a boss spawn will fail to materialize for at least the first couple of boss waves as there will be insufficient credits. Most notably, on wave 10 on Monsoon difficulty the director will initially have access to 599.19 credits, while the cheapest boss monster costs 600. In rare cases a boss monster can spawn on wave 10 if another boss monster is rerolled after the first one and the director now has 600 credits.

Since there can be a maximum of 30 enemies spawned at once, the director stops accumulating credits when it hits the limit and resumes when at least one enemy has been killed.

=== Tips ===

* In stark contrast to eclipse, simulacrum is about dealing with large crowds of enemies over an endless run. Items that deal with large groups such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}} are of extreme value during this mode and should be prioritised. Conversely, single target damage items should be of generally lower value.
* Pay attention to what items enemies get at the end of each stage. In particular movement and attack speed altering items can mess with muscle memory and cause a loss to a foolishly timed dodge. If {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} shows up make sure to give blazing elites a very wide berth and if {{ItemLink|itemName=Unstable Tesla Coil}} is added, cry.
* Don't get greedy! The void fog builds up damage fast and can kill players in just a few seconds without healing items. Furthermore the focus only moves slightly slower than base move speed so getting left behind is usually a death sentance. 
* {{ArtifactLink|Command}} waves will affect '''ALL''' item drops while the wave is active, including any drops from [[3D Printers]]. Use the chance to open any nearby chests. If a Printer is nearby and the risk is not overwhelming printing every item of that rarity will provide an extreme amount of value. Keep in mind you will need to choose each item from the command drops, so be careful if its the 5th wave when it occurs and the focus is about to move or if the printer is outside the focus.
* {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}} still houses its legendary chest in the usual spot, though it's difficult to both reach and afford.
* Because of the continuous predictable swarms of foes as well as lack of early boss enemies, many survivors normally less valuable skills are of higher value during simulacrum and may even be the better option in the gamemode:
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}} will get a lot more value out of {{SkillLink|skillName=Phase Round}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Frag Grenade}} due to the large amount of weaker enemies lined up and grouped up. He can get easily overwhelmed with his alternative options.
** Due to the holdout nature of the mode {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} can get much more value out of his {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Pressure Mines}} than a normal run (though neither are strongly recommended). It should also go without saying that {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|altText=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} are ''significantly'' stronger and should always be used over their alternative here.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}} can deal with the various swarms of weak crowds with {{SkillLink|skillName=Arrow Rain}} as apposed to its more single target alternative.
** Since being close range is harder to avoid, as well the void potentials making getting an {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} more reliable, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}} using {{SkillLink|skillName=Flamethrower}} may be appealing. {{SkillLink|skillName=Plasma Bolt}} is also much stronger due to the clumped groups.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} beacons are extremely valuable, due to either helping the holdout zone or open the harder to afford chests. {{SkillLink|skillName=Beacon: Resupply}} is next to useless however as the [[Squid Polyp|two]] [[Bundle of Fireworks|items]] that synergise with it are blacklisted and it's rare to even get equipment. His {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}} meanwhile is much easier to get value from due to the predictable and low range of enemies spawning.
** Since they have less space to move around, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}} should take {{SkillLink|skillName=Thunder Gauntlet}} and{{SkillLink|skillName=Blinding Assault}} respectively. They can find themselves falling outside the focus frequently otherwise.
** As stages take very long and have far more enemies spawning, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado}} is incredibly strong and can gain an absurd amount of stacks with no need to spend extra time on the stage.
** Since she has less need for the mobility of her default option {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} can take {{SkillLink|skillName=Polar Field Device}} to help control the large crowds of enemies, while the close nature of combat means {{SkillLink|skillName=HH44 Marksman}} is much more valuable.
* In a similar vein, item value gets turned on its head here and normally powerful items can end up being less important than expected. It's not uncommon for a normally high power item to get turned down for what is normally considered a trash item:
** Mobility items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Paul's Goat Hoof}} and especially {{ItemLink|itemName=Energy Drink}} are significantly less valuable than normal in this mode, as movement speed isn't needed to move around the stage, though it still helps to avoid damage and grab chests and it is still advised to grab a few. Having too much movespeed will also make staying within the focus much harder and could cause a stray tick or two from the void fog to finish you off.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Bustling Fungus}} is far more useful than normal due to the downtime between waves letting you heal, as well as being an option to heal damage from the void when grabbing chests. Furthermore if things go south and the focus falters it will help you outlast any remaining enemies and end the wave.  {{ItemLink|itemName=Weeping Fungus}} is even stronger and is particularly useful for going outside of the focus.
** As mentioned before, anything that deals with crowds is of extreme value. Besides the afformentioned {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Berzerker's Pauldron}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Ceremonial Dagger}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Frost Relic}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=H3AD-5T v2}} should all be of top priority.
** While {{ItemLink|itemName=Polylute}}  and {{ItemLink|itemName=Voidsent Flame}} are normally better than their non-corrupted counterparts, they are arguably less useful here and may be worth leaving uncorrupted.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Rusted Key}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Encrusted Key}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shipping Request Form}} are much harder to get value from, both due to the longer stage length but also their respective interactibles often being unreachable.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Warbanner}} is highly valuable, even though it doesn't spawn on a wave starting having even one within a Focus will provide a buff for most of its zone.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Lepton Daisy}} is significantly buffed in the gamemode as it will be active in every single wave, being a constant source of health. Getting a few can be particularly valuable during a multiplayer game.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Razorwire}} can be deliberately activated by standing in the void fog. With a few stacks darting in and out of the fog can wipe out most waves.
** Since players gain far less money than normal, {{ItemLink|itemName=Ghor's Tome}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} are of higher value especially in early waves.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Eulogy Zero}} is extremely impactful as the player has very limited access to lunar items. Since all waves give a choice of three items, it's rare for it to have a negative impact. It has a significant side effect of letting enemies have a chance of getting lunar items, but this can actually play to your favour by wasting their item on a weak lunar of which the downsides can end up being a huge boon. Notably, {{ItemLink|itemName=Light Flux Pauldron}} and{{ItemLink|itemName=Mercurial Rachis}} are mostly helpful and both {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Stone Flux Pauldron}} can end up being beneficial depending on the situation. {{ItemLink|itemName=Egocentrism}} is basically an instant game over, however so you will be playing with fire.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
*Other Changes
**{{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} and {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} now acknowledge imposters.
*Bug Fixes
**{{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} will correctly drop a red-tier item when defeated in Simulacrum while holding {{ItemLink|Sonorous Whispers}}.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.5]]
*Resolved a reported issue with the [[Prismatic Trial]] leaderboard not displaying any times.
----
;[[PC Patch v1.2.2.0]]
*Simulacrum

**Waves now have a limit of how many credits can be given out at once
**Waves will now spawn slightly more elites, and slightly less normal monsters
**Artifact of Kin will always spawn monsters, even if they are considered ‘cheap’
**Developer Notes: Simulacrum has a few edge cases where the director fails to spawn monsters - and as a result, the gamemode no longer advances. We added a few different checks to address situations where the game gets stuck. Not only that, but simulacrum tended to spam a lot more normal monsters instead of elites - so now, it’ll spawn a little bit more elite-y.

== Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*'''General'''
**'''Final Stage'''
***🌧 The final stage has been redone entirely, with unique objectives and a new, large arena to play in. We won’t spoil it. Please let us know how you feel!
**'''Low Health Threshold''' 
***20% ⇒ 25%
**'''NPC AI'''
***All AI now have dramatically improved pathfinding
***All AI now gets position updates on targets who are invisible only every few seconds, rather than losing the target entirely
**'''Minions'''
***Drones no longer have resistance to AOE attacks
*** 🌧 All minions now teleport to their owner if they stray past 400m
*** 🌧 All Minions now scale to the ‘ambient level’ of the run &lt;br&gt; ''Developer’s Notes: The ‘ambient level’ is the level of the run that grows over time. Previously, the enemy team used the ‘ambient level’ to set their level. Now, all enemies AND minions are at ambient level. '''The result of this is that player minions, like ghosts from Happiest Mask, purchased Drones, and yes - the Squid Polyp - will scale much better over time. This matches drone scaling in RoR1.'''''
*'''Survivor'''
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Commando}}'''
***Update VFX of Double Tap, Phase Round, and Suppressive Fire
***{{SkillLink|Double Tap|Commando}}
****Now fires a single bullet per click
****Bloom Reset Time: 1s ⇒0.7s
****Damage: 90% ⇒ 100%
**** Duration: 0.2s ⇒ 0.15s
***{{SkillLink|Tactical Dive|Commando}}
****Duration: 0.5s ⇒ 0.4s
*** {{SkillLink|Phase Round|Commando}}
****Now deals 40% more damage every time it passes through an enemy
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}'''
***Now unlocked by default alongside the {{SurvivorLink|Commando}}! Her previous [[Warrior|unlock condition]] (beat the 3rd stage) now unlocks the {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}}.
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}'''
***Both {{skillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Gauss Auto-Turret}} and {{skillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret|Engineer|Carbonizer Turret}} now also inherit your equipment. They won’t activate it, but they will hold it.
***{{SkillLink|Bouncing Grenades|Engineer|Grenades}} now have slight anti-gravity.
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}'''
***{{SkillLink|Charged Nano-Bomb|Artificer|Nano-Bomb}}
****Tendril Damage: 20% of explosion ⇒ 10% of explosion
****Tendril Fire Frequency: 0.25s ⇒ 0.125s
***Tendril Same Target Frequency: 2s ⇒ 1s &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: This change is made specifically to avoid the Artificer’s Nano-Bomb tendrils proccing Ice and Fire Bands. The tendrils will now fire twice as often, but at half the damage.''
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}'''
***{{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}}
****🌧 Now has a lingering 0.2s invincibility to help chain together Blinding Assaults in high-latency online games
*'''Items'''
**'''{{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}'''
***Start Delay: 2s ⇒ 1s
*** Now heals at a higher tick rate - overall healing is the same, but the healing is smoother over time
***🌧 Now has small visual mushrooms that grow over the area
**'''{{ItemLink|Energy Drink}}'''
***🌧 Speed Boost: 30% (+20% per stack) ⇒ 25% (+25% per stack) &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Mathematically, the Energy Drink was worse than the Goat Hoof for speed after the first pickup, even while sprinting. This change will consistently make Energy Drink stronger when sprinting, and also makes its stacking behavior more consistent. This may make the Energy Drink too strong, but it’ll at least make a bit more sense now.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds|altText=AP Rounds}}''' 
***Improve visual effects to be more noticeable
**'''{{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}}'''
***Damage Boost: 15% (+15% per stack) ⇒ 20% (+20% per stack)
***Now shows radius for ‘nearby’ distance
*** Now causes numbers to be pink when active &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: There are many characters and builds where the Focus Crystal should shine through - however, it never seems to be quite high priority enough for the effort required. We’re hoping that by making it both flashier and stronger, players will prioritize it.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Rusted Key}}'''
***🌧 Now subtly glows and pulses
***Now grants items at the same rarity as a Large Chest
***Now spawns a Lockbox per player with a Rusted Key
*** Now consumes a Rusted Key when a lockbox is opened, and requires a Rusted Key to open
***No longer scales reward chance with the number of Keys in your inventory &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: People have always been a bit confused about the behavior of the Rusted Key, so we made it make a bit more sense by actually consuming a key to open. 1 Key = 1 Box. Since the item no longer gives ‘infinite’ items, we can also make it a bit stronger and make the lockbox more noticeable.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Crowbar}}''' 
***Damage Boost: +50%(+50% per stack) ⇒ +75% (+75% per stack)
***Improve visual effects to be more noticeable
***Update pickup text to include the damage threshold &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Same reasoning as Focus Crystal - there are many heavy-hitter builds and characters, but Crowbars aren’t prioritized.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Gasoline}}'''
***Now deals 150% base damage on detonation alongside the burn effect
** '''{{ItemLink|Stun Grenade}}'''
***Added visual effect when the item procs
** '''{{ItemLink|Bison Steak|altText=Bison Steak (New! Yum!)}}'''
***Replaced ‘Fresh Meat’ item
***No longer grants regeneration on kill
*** Now grants 25 (+25 per stack) max health
**'''{{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}'''
***Bleed Chance: 15% (+15% per stack) ⇒ 10% (+10% per stack) &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Right now, bleed is okay until you can stack it infinitely, in which case it becomes incredibly strong. We want to smooth out the power curve a bit, increasing the number of daggers required for ‘infinite’ bleed to match the number of Glasses required for 100% crit.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}}'''
***🌧 Now activates in all ‘holdout zones’, like {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, and not just during the Teleporter Event
** '''{{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit}}'''
***Now activates when falling to low health, rather than as a chance when hurt
*** Stealth Duration: 3s (+1.5s per stack) ⇒ 5s
***Stealth Cooldown: 0s ⇒ 30s (-50% per stack)
**'''{{ItemLink|Bandolier}}'''
***🌧 Packs now restocks skills by the amount a full cooldown would
***🌧 Packs now also apply to stashed skills, like {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} second primary
**'''{{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}}'''
***🌧 Now details if an interactable is a Barrel, Chest, Drone, Shrine, or something unknown
**'''{{ItemLink|Frost Relic}}''' 
***🌧 Now applies {{StatusEffectLink|Slow80|ice slow debuff}}
***🌧 Now has a softer visual
***Damage Coefficient: 150% ⇒ 300%
***Radius: 3m (+1.5m per kill) ⇒ 6m (+3m per kill)
**'''{{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}}'''
***🌧 Now calculates damage from distance traveled, not speed on impact &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Even though this makes less sense from a physics standpoint, it will align better with player expectations. Super long fall = big boom.''
** '''{{ItemLink|Resonance Disc|altText=Resonance Disk}}''' 
***Redo firing logic to be more understandable
****Now grants 1 stacking buff per kill, lasting 5 seconds
****Now fires the Disk at 4 stacks, resetting all stacks
**'''{{ItemLink|Defiant Gouge}}'''
*** 🌧 Monster Spawn Points: 100 (+100 per stack) ⇒ 40 (+40 per stack) &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: A single Gouge would spawn way too many monsters. Now, having 1 or 2 Gouges should be a reasonable option.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Focused Convergence}}'''
*** 🌧 Now activates in all ‘holdout zones’, like {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, and not just during the Teleporter Event
**'''{{ItemLink|Queen's Gland|altText=Queen’s Gland}}'''
***Limit of deployed Beetle Guards now doubles for {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}}
**'''{{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}'''
***Changed summoned Aurelionite pre-stack scaling from current-difficulty-based hp + damage bonuses to leveling up to the ambient level like other summoned characters
***Summoned Aurelionite attention span: 5s ⇒ 15s &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Aurelionite’s raised attention span should make it less likely to get distracted by weaker monsters attacking it so it’s more likely to spend its time fighting stronger monsters.''
** '''{{ItemLink|Mired Urn}}''' 
*** No longer capable of targeting and healing from allies
*'''Monster'''
**'''{{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab}}''' 
***Base Damage: 4 (+0.8 per level) ⇒ 12 (+2.4 per level)
***Mortar Projectile Count: 3 ⇒ 1
***Mortar Projectile now has more visible trail &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: When fighting Hermit Crabs, it’s always been difficult to parse where and how many there are. To help clarify their behavior, we made it clearer so 1 mortar = 1 crab.''
** '''{{MonsterLink|Parent}}'''
***Health: 900(+270 per level) ⇒ 585 (+176 per level)
*** Update visuals to match closer to [[Ror:Parent|RoR1]] design
***Update animations
**'''{{MonsterLink|Greater Wisp}}''' 
***🌧 Can now be {{keyword|d|Stunning|stunned}} and {{keyword|u|Freezing|frozen}}
**'''{{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)}}'''
***Health: 1900 (+570 per level) ⇒ 1615 (+485 per level)
***Twinshot Attack
****Total Shots: 4 ⇒ 10
****Damage Coefficient: 2 ⇒ 1
****Force: 8000 ⇒ 1000
****Now fires in series, rather than all at once
****Update visuals to be less noisy
***Raised the aim origin to be closer to its cannons so it can fire more accurately
**'''{{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}}''' 
***Tracking Bomb
****Damage Coefficient: 6 ⇒ 5
****Speed: 90m/s ⇒ 60m/s
****Update visuals to be less noisy
**'''{{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen}}'''
*** Summon Beetles
**** Beetle Count: 5 ⇒ 2
**** 🌧 Now summons {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards}} instead of {{MonsterLink|Beetle|Beetles}}
** '''{{MonsterLink|Scavenger}}'''
***Now properly spawn as elites &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Apparently, Scavengers were already spawning as elites - with their health and damage buff - but did not have their elite equipment (Burning, Glacial, etc). Now they will.''
**'''{{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}}'''
***Added a minimum distance between bombs
**'''SPOILERS! Final Boss, Last Phase. SPOILERS!'''
***Base Health: 1000 (+300 per level) ⇒ 1400 (+420 per level)

      <text bytes="1441" sha1="nc0vljrt8ejej0h23h4kiz40qb6cyhh" xml:space="preserve">{{EnvironmentPage}}'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the five new environments added to the game with the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' DLC, located on {{EntityLink|Petrichor V}}, and one of three stage 2 [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

It has two variants, with the only notable difference being the location of the stage's giant towers. 

== Interactables==
{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters ==
{{MonsterList}}

==Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and exactly 1 will spawn.

{{Newt Altars/Aphelian Sanctuary}}

== Notes ==

* Although [[Lunar Pod]]s are listed as a possible interactable, they will never show up during gameplay; the [[Directors|Scene Director]] can attempt to spawn them but will always fail, wasting those credits. This is due to the fact that the entire stage is covered by an invisible ceiling and the Lunar Pods require a clear spot.
** [[Halcyon Shrine]]s will also fail for the same reason.

==Lore==
{{Lore}}

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.5]]
*Players reported that on a certain version of {{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}, a mysterious floating tree would spawn. The tree has been returned to the ground where it belongs.
----
;[[Survivors of the Void]]
*(Undocumented) Added New Stage: Aphelian Sanctuary
}}

==Trivia == 
*A pillar at one far end of the map resembles the Obelisk found in [[A Moment, Fractured]] flipped upside down.

      <text bytes="5583" sha1="di4go0ocgqs9w0ebyseg4p1pzibro66" xml:space="preserve">'''Armor''' is a mostly obscure stat present on both [[Survivors]] and [[monsters]]. Having positive armor reduces the damage that character takes, and having negative armor increases the damage taken. This damage modification applies to all damage taken, except for the damage from a [[Shrine of Blood]] and damage from {{SotV|Void Fog}}[[Void Fog]].

Damage taken is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;1 - Armor / (100 + |Armor|)&lt;/math&gt; . This is a number between 0 and 2.

If a character has positive armor:

* Damage taken is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;100 / (100 + Armor)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a number between 0 and 1.
* The formula for the damage reduction is: &lt;math&gt;Armor / (100 + Armor)&lt;/math&gt;.

If a character has negative armor:

* Damage taken is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;2 - 100 / (100 - Armor)&lt;/math&gt;. This is a number between 1 and 2. (Note that the negative armor is subtracted, and two negatives make a positive.)
* The formula for the damage increase is: &lt;math&gt;100 / (100 - Armor) - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
The armor value that modifies the damage is a sum of the following contributions:

*The value of the armor stat (base armor + modifications)
* +adaptive armor
*+300 if the character is an {{ItemLink|itemName=Empathy Cores|altText=Empathy Core}} and the incoming attack has the AoE damage flag. AoE is considered any blast attack, i.e., any attack that deals damage in a spherical volume. In addition, {{SkillLink|Unseen Hand}} and the torus explosion of the [[Monsters#Gilded|Gilded Elites]] also have this flag, even though they are technically not blast attacks.

The modified damage is then decreased by 5 per stack of {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate}}. Note that the final damage can never be less than 1.

[[File:ArmorGraph.png|thumb|700x700px|Graph of damage multiplier for values of armor from -1000 armor to 1000 armor. It can be seen that negative armor slowly approaches 2x damage taken, while positive armor slowly approaches 0x damage taken.|alt=|none]]

It would take 330 {{ItemLink|Rose Buckler|altText=Rose Bucklers}} (+30 armor per stack while sprinting) to get a damage reduction of 99% while sprinting. This would amount to 9900 armor. Another way to achieve this amount of armor would be by obtaining 99 {{ItemLink|Oddly-shaped Opal|altText=Oddly-Shaped Opals}} to get the same damage reduction while out of combat.

==Armor Modifications==
Most survivors and monsters have 0 base armor, with some exceptions:
*{{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}, {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, {{SurvivorLink|REX}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Seeker}}, and {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} each have 20 base armor.
*{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} has 12 base armor.
*[[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monsters]] have some base armor. See their individual pages for exact values.

The following calculations are then applied to this base value:
#{{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl|altText=Irradiant Pearls}} multiplies this value by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.1 &amp;sdot; stacks&lt;/code&gt;.
# {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} multiplies this by 1.07.
#Playing on {{EntityLink|entityName=Drizzle|altUrl=Difficulty#Drizzle}} grants each player a [[DrizzlePlayerHelper|hidden item]] which adds 70 armor.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Armor Boost}} adds 200 armor.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Small Armor Boost}} adds 100 armor.
#{{ItemLink|Oddly-shaped Opal|altText=Oddly-shaped Opals}} adds 100 armor per stack while out of danger.
#{{ItemLink|Jade Elephant}} adds 500 armor while {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElephantArmorBoost|altText=active}}.
#{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Void Survivor Corruption}}  adds 100 armor while {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}} is corrupted.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Twisted Armor}} adds 300 armor to allies tethered to a {{StatusEffectLink|Twisted}} elite.
#{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}} reduces armor by 20.
#{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Pulverized}} by {{ItemLink|Shattering Justice}} reduces armor by 60.
#{{ItemLink|Rose Buckler}} adds 30 armor per stack while sprinting.
#{{SurvivorLink|False Son}} gains 2.5 armor per secondary skill charge available. This means that at the default 4 charges and with no other armor modifications, False Son has the highest starting armor of 30.
#{{StatusEffectLink|PermanentDebuff}} by {{ItemLink|Symbiotic Scorpion}} reduces armor by 2 per stack.
#{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Weak}} reduces armor by 30.
#{{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} grants 20 armor while {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TonicBuff|altText=active}}.
#{{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}} multiplies the above accumulated value by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.04 &amp;sdot; itemStacks &amp;sdot; buffStacks&lt;/code&gt;

==Adaptive Armor==
{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} have the adaptive armor passive stat, which protect them against bursts of damage. Every time they take damage, they gain temporary [[armor]] equal to &lt;math&gt;3000 \times (damage/maxHP)&lt;/math&gt;, or 30 armor per 1% of the max HP dealt. This armor caps at 400 and decays at a rate of 40 per second.{{SiteNav}}

'''Armor-Piercing Rounds''' are an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item increases damage dealt by 20% ''(+20% per stack)'' against [[Bosses]] and Hordes of Many spawned by the [[Teleporter]], Bosses spawned during the 5th and 10th wave of the [[Simulacrum]], [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Bosses]], and the Umbrae from the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}}.

== Notes ==

* This item is also effective against the {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)|Lunar Chimera Golems}}, {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|Lunar Chimera Wisps}}, and {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Exploder)|Lunar Chimera Exploders}} that appear in phase 2 of the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} fight. It does not have an effect against any Lunar Chimeras that spawn in Phase 3, however.
* The item will change damage numbers to orange when activated.

* This item affects enemies with '''red health bars'''. This means they will deal extra damage to non-boss Horde of Many monsters, but will not affect naturally spawning boss monsters that are not spawned by the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. 
** Any monsters that have {{ItemLink|Infusion|altText=Infusions}} will have their health bar changed to a reddish color as a result of the Infusions; these are ''not'' considered bosses. This is only relevant in the [[Void Fields]], while the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} is enabled, during the Simulacrum, or while fighting a {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} that spawns with or finds Infusions.

The following page contains spoiler-free hints towards the location of [[Artifacts|Artifact]] codes. Each category corresponds to an artifact, using the first two letters of its name to help identify already possessed ones.

Each artifact has a hint split in 3 parts giving increasingly precise location. Hover a hint part to reveal it.

==CH==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where the '''tar''' is omnipresent
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;lies a '''broken''' tablet. While one half is easily found near a tunnel
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;the other is protected by an ancient '''gate'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==CO==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;'''where without a when'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Never fear '''the peaceful beast'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;'''Behind him,''' you'll see&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==DE==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where ruins are '''flooded'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;one must ignore their fear of '''falls'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;as a secret lies within the '''cliff'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==DI==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where the '''temperature''' is high
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;climbing to great '''heights'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;will reveal a code, albeit a '''sideways''' one&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==EN==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where one can take on a '''trial'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;representations of '''design''' float everywhere
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;overshadowed by the '''largest''' one&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==EV==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where one has shown '''fealty'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;a grotesque '''creature''' awaits
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;which must be '''inspected''' before bloodshed&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==FR==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where lies the crashed '''ship'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;a '''probe''' illuminates a tablet
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;but some part of it is imprisoned in the '''void'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==GL==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where one can do a '''sacrifice'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;a treacherous path leads to the '''obelisk'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;obscuring the key '''nearby'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==HO==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where both otherworldly '''beauty''' and '''nostalgy''' strike
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;a large contraption lies deep '''underground'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;the first code is '''in plain sight'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==KI==
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;Where strange flying creatures '''nest'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;those who seek guidance must first '''ascend'''
&lt;div class="hidden-hover"&gt;and find their prize between two '''lights'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==ME==

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is randomly dropped by enemies in [[Bulwark's Ambry]] during an Artifact Trial. They are used to interact with and damage the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}, which is otherwise completely impervious to normal damage. When used, all Artifact Keys in the player's inventory, as well as those still on the field, are consumed, preventing the player from stockpiling them.

The Artifact Key's drop chance is not affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} or {{ItemLink|Purity}}, and it will drop even if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is not enabled.

It is one of few items that the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} has no effect on. Though a Yellow Command Essence will drop, it cannot be transformed into any item except the Artifact Key.

== Notes ==
*This is the only [[Items#Boss|boss item]] that does not get corrupted into {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}}, as this would prevent the player from damaging the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}, thus causing a sotflock.
* When using an Artifact Key on the boss any keys that are still in midfall will not be removed. It is then possible to obtain a key after killing the boss, but it will still be removed from your inventory upon stage change.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Boss]] [[Monsters|Monster]] found only in {{EntityLink|entityName=Bulwark's Ambry}}. It serves as the Boss for the various [[Artifacts|Artifact]] Trials, and contains the current Trial's Artifact.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
The Reliquary is immune to all normal forms of damage. To defeat it, the player must interact with it while carrying an {{ItemLink|Artifact Key}}. Doing so consumes all Artifact Keys, deals 1/4 damage to the Reliquary, and causes it to emit a shock wave that pushes nearby players and flying enemies a considerable distance. 

Once the Reliquary is given the first Artifact Key, [[Monsters]] begin to spawn and the Reliquary begins firing lasers in a set pattern around itself to attack, which home in on any nearby player. Its fire rate increases the lower its HP becomes, and its lasers become faster and gain stronger homing capabilities.

Enemies will drop the second, third, and fourth keys, which must each be taken to the central sphere. When the fourth key is turned in, the sphere will be destroyed, and upon retrieving the artifact within the Reliquary, a portal will open to bring the player to the next stage.

== Notes ==
* Upon being given an {{ItemLink|Artifact Key}}, '''ALL''' Artifact Keys are consumed, regardless if they're lying on the ground or are in other players' inventories. It is impossible to stockpile Artifact Keys by not picking them up. The only exception to this is that keys that have not finished their spawning animation are not consumed.
* The shock wave and subsequent knockback can be blocked with {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}.
* Enemies will not spawn if all players stray too far away from the main platform (for instance, by reaching the floating cube where the code for the Artifact of Enigma can be found).
* If the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} is active, the Reliquary can become Overloading, allowing it to recover some of its health as shields if keys are not dropped quickly enough.
* The Reliquary can be healed by allied {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mini Mushrum|altText=Mini Mushrums}}, and allied monsters or Umbras spawned by the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} if they have {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}.
* Due to the internal mechanism implemented for the [[Level#Ambient Level|monster level]] and the fact that the Reliquary does not use this, it will most likely always be level 1. However, if the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is enabled during the Trial, monsters may kill each other which rewards their team with experience and levelling up just like the players. If the Reliquary does level up, its health will increase accordingly which may require more than 4 Artifact Keys in total to complete the Trial.

Try to avoid these items with this Artifact active, especially for melee Survivors.
**In addition, {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} explosions cannot be blocked by {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}.

''"Command" redirects here. For the playable survivor, see {{SurvivorLink|Commando}}.'' 

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact that replaces [[Items|item]] pickups with '''Command Essences''' appropriate to the original pickup's tier. Interacting with it will open a command menu, allowing choice of any valid item within that tier to be selected instead.

Any items that you have not unlocked will not be selectable, except in the case of when it's enabled during a [[Prismatic Trial]].

[[File:Command Essences.png|thumb|A White, Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Void, and Blue (Equipment) Command Essence respectively]]

==Command Essence==
*Some items are unique and won't show in regular Command Essences. Instead, they get a Command Essence that only shows that specific item when they are dropped from their original corresponding sources.
**{{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}} - {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Aurelionite}} on {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Gilded Coast}} 
**{{ItemLink|Artifact Key}} - Artifact Reliquary
**{{ItemLink|Pearl}} / {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}} - [[Cleansing Pool]]
**{{ItemLink|Item Scrap, White}} / {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Green}} / {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Red}} / {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Yellow}} - [[Scrapper]]
* Similarly, normal Orange Command Essence does not include [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]]. Each Elite equipment has its own Orange Command Essence that randomly drops when defeating an Elite monster of that type (e.g. a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixRed}} Elite can only ever drop an Orange Command Essence containing {{ItemLink|itemName=Ifrit's Distinction}}).
*Some items are unable to be dropped at all, and thus their command essence will never appear in normal gameplay.
**{{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}}
*In the [[Simulacrum]], certain items are blacklisted and thus cannot be selected from Command Essences, even if they are unlocked. These are {{ItemLink|Bundle of Fireworks}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Squid Polyp}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Focused Convergence}}.

==Notes==
*Only one player can interact with a Command Essence at a time.
*Being pushed far enough away from the item will automatically cancel interacting with it.
*Players are still vulnerable to damage while selecting an item.
*While {{Color|lunar|Lunar Item}} and {{Color|lunar|Lunar Equipment}} essences both display as a {{Color|lunar|Blue Command Essence}} with a blue outline, the inner circle and light is orange/white for {{Color|lunar|Lunar Equipment}} and light blue for {{Color|lunar|Lunar Items}}.
*Some [[Survivors]], like {{SurvivorLink|REX}}, are able to use their secondary ability while the menu is still open (albeit without the capacity to aim said attack).
*[[Chests#Multishop Terminal|Multishop Terminals]], [[3D Printers]], [[Cleansing Pool]]s, and [[Scrapper]]s do not spawn with this Artifact.
* When activating a {{SotV|Void Cradle}}[[Void Cradle]] with Command active, it will drop a {{Color|void|Void Essence}} corresponding to the dropped item's tier (Void Common, Void Uncommon, Void Legendary, or Void Boss).
** Similarly {{SotV}}[[Void Potential]] orbs will be restricted to one rarity. However, unlike the Void Cradle, the rarity is not dependent on the generated loot, but the tier of the orb, which has deterministic results every time. 
***For example, a white orb from the Void Potential chest and a white orb from Simulacrum will only give common items, even though their underlying loot distributions are different. Similarly, the purple orb from '''Encrusted Cache''' with the  {{ItemLink|Encrusted Key}} and the purple orb from {{SotV}}[[Simulacrum]] will only give {{Color|void}} common items.

===Command Menus===
Note that some items may be locked to a specific DLC.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Artifact of Delusion resets all chests once the teleporter event is finished and provides players the chance to receive additional items if they interact with the reset chests.''''' 

== Notes ==
*This Artifact resets chests after the [[Teleporter#Completion|Teleporter Event]], at the end of the trial in {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}, and after every 5th wave in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].
*This reset affects only [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chests]], [[Chests#Large Chest|Large Chests]], [[Chests#Category Chest|Category Chests]], [[Chests#Large Category Chest|Large Category Chests]], and [[Chests#Cloaked Chest|Cloaked Chests]].
*Chests are reset as long as they have been opened, even if their loot is still on the ground. However, it will not display its choices until its dropped item is picked up.
**The correct answer to the challenge is whatever item is collected from the pickup it dropped, not what item it had originally dropped. For example, with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} or a {{ItemLink|itemName=Recycler}} the correct choice is whatever the item is eventually transformed into.
*Reset chests do not cost anything, unlike the original purchase, and the player is instead prompted with the message "Remember..." which opens up a panel with three items one of which is the correct choice. Selecting the correct item will produce another free copy of it, while failing the memory game will take away a stack of the item incorrectly selected.
**This item is taken away from the interacting player. It does not matter who originally purchased the chest or who picked up its loot.
**If the interacting player chooses wrong but has no stacks of said item, the visual effect of the item being taken away will play but it will have no effect.
*The fake choices are randomly selected from the player's inventory that interacts with the chest after it has been reset. Even if the player then leaves to pick up more items and comes back, this won't affect what choices will be offered.
**The fake choices for each player depend on their own inventory. Therefore, it is possible to compare the options between two players in a multiplayer game to narrow down the correct choice.
**The fake choices ensure that they meet the requirements of the owning chest, e.g., Large Chests can only produce {{Color|Uncommon|uncommon}} and {{Color|Legendary|legendary}} items, while Category Chests can only produce items of a specific item category.
***This can be used to the player's advantage. For example, if the item from a Damage Chest has been rerolled into a healing item, this will be the correct choice since the fake ones could have never produced such a choice.
*** The fake choices cannot be scrap items, but there is a flaw in the filtering process which does allow {{Color|boss|Boss}} items and {{ItemLink|itemName=Regenerating Scrap (Consumed)}}, which is an {{Color|untiered|Untiered}} item, to be valid fake choices.
***If the player's inventory does not have enough items that meet the requirements to choose fakes from, random ones will be generated. These fake items are selected by generating new loot from the relevant chest, so they will always meet the requirements of being valid. While the fake items can never be the same as the correct one, it is possible, however unlikely, to be the same with each other.
*The color of the panel can be white, {{Color|Uncommon|green}}, or {{Color|Legendary|red}}. This is decided by the leftmost item in the choices and in no way hints what the rarity of the correct choice is.
*Using {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} will make this Artifact useless.
*This Artifact synergizes well with {{ArtifactLink|Devotion}} since if the player offers a good item to a Lemurian egg, they have the opportunity to also get a copy of it after the teleporter event.
*The code can be found in the [[Verdant Falls]], but is also secretly hidden in the promotional trailer for the update behind in titles of the new artifacts. 

==Bugs==
*With the multiple drops of {{ItemLink|itemName=Sale Star}} the correct answer for the artifact is whichever item has been picked up most recently, as all of the chest's multiple drops overwrite the same correct answer upon being picked up.

==Version History==
&lt;!-- This was moved from #Notes, but it needs actual citations. --&gt;
*When this Artifact was introduced with the [[Devotion Update]] chests would be reset only if their loot had been picked up before the completion of the teleporter event. This change was introduced in the [[Seekers of the Storm]] update and it may have been a bug.
**This change allows the player to only pick up a few influential items that can help during the teleporter event and then return to pick up any loot remaining so they can trivially pass the memory test.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact that replaces broken drones with Lemurian Eggs. Giving an item to it will hatch a {{MonsterLink|Lemurian}} as an ally, and all other devoted lemurians will also receive the item.

== Lemurian Eggs==
[[File:Lemurian Egg.png|thumb]]
* Replaces [[Interactables#Drones|Drones and Turrets]] found on the stage with Lemurian Eggs.
* The purchase does not require money, but one [[Items|item]] must be given in order to spawn a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lemurian}} ally.
**Only items from Common, {{Color|Uncommon|Uncommon}}, {{Color|Legendary|Legendary}}, and {{Color|Boss|Boss}} rarities are allowed.
**Since {{Color|Void|Corrupted}} items cannot be offered, it adds an extra layer of strategy for the player whether they would prefer to corrupt an item in case they want to give its uncorrupted version to an ally in the future.
**Items from the [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|TurretBlacklist category]] cannot be given.
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Artifact Key}} can be given, though to no effect.
*The number of possible Lemurian allies appears unlimited.
*The presence of a [[Void Seed]] on the stage prevents interacting with the eggs until it is collapsed.
*{{Color|note|Bug:}} During the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] new visual lock objects are constantly created but only the most recent one disappears at the end of the event. This gives the false impression the eggs remain locked afterwards even though they can be properly interacted with.

==Devoted Lemurian==
{{MonsterPage|Lemurian}}

*The Lemurians adhere to the player level, not the [[Difficulty#Effect on enemy level|enemy level]] like most allies. Similar to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets their power is mostly derived by the items they hold.
*Both Lemurian and Elder Lemurian allies are governed by the same [[Enemy AI|AI]] and as such do not act like their monster versions. It is notable that since they cannot sprint, they do not benefit from sprinting related items. Their behaviors are the following: 
**'''Use secondary''': The ally must be within 15m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 1.5 seconds, which means a Lemurian attempts to bite multiple times in this time frame.
**'''Use primary while strafing''': The ally must be within 65m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2 seconds. Since the [[Lemurian#Primary: Fireball|primary attack]] of Lemurians has no cooldown and strafing an enemy effectively keeps some distance unless the enemy closes in, Lemurian allies will constantly use their Fireball attack from greater distance than a monster Lemurian would.
**'''Return to owner''': The ally must be at least 15m away from its owner.
**'''Stay idle near owner''': While this has no distance restrictions, due to the above behavior it will only be selected if the ally is within 15m from its owner.
**While this AI has more behaviors, one of the above behavior will have had its requirements met by this point. This makes the remaining behaviors pointless which are not listed for the sake of brevity.

==Levels==
* The Lemurians also have another internal level, called Devoted Level, which starts at 0. Every time a boss fight is completed, each Lemurian increases their Devoted Level by 1, which affects their stats and evolution.
**A boss fight is considered any fight which has a red health bar on the screen, i.e., [[Teleporter|Teleporter Boss]], {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|Umbras}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alloy Worship Unit}}, and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Artifact Reliquary}}. 
***However, {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} and {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}} do not allow Lemurians to level up since the respective final boss fights take place in multiple distinct boss phases.
**At level 1 a Lemurian evolves to an [[Monsters#Elite|Elite]], randomly choosing from a [[Monsters#Elites|Tier 1 Elite]]. At level 2 they transform to an {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Elder Lemurian}} without an Elite modifier and at level 3 they once again gain an Elite modifier randomly chosen from Tier1, Tier2, and Perfected Elites.
**A level 0 or 2 Lemurian is also given 10 stacks of [[BoostHp]] and 10 stacks of [[BoostDamage]], i.e., they have 200% health and damage. At level 1 or 3 they are given 20 stacks of each, while for levels above 3 they are given &lt;math&gt;20 + devotedLevel - 3&lt;/math&gt; stacks.
**The Lemurian allies will only level up if this Artifact is active. Therefore, in a game with this Artifact disabled, but enabled in {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}, it's recommended not to sacrifice items there as these allies will not level up outside this Environment and will remain weak for the remainder of the run.
*Each time a Lemurian levels up, they will add also one more stack of their Devoted Item to the player's Devoted Item Pool. The inventory of each Lemurian is also rebuilt at that point.
**This makes {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}} a very potent item. It does not matter if the Lemurian that was offered it consumes it as long as they are still alive when a boss fight is completed. At this point they, and every other Lemurian, will replenish their stacks, along with the extra stack from the Lemurian with this Devoted Item that levels up. The same applies to {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}.
**However, a stack of{{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}} '''is''' removed from the Devoted Item Pool when a Lemurian with this Devoted Item dies. But similar to Power Elixir, it is very useful in keeping all Lemurians alive which also protects the Devoted Item Pool from shrinking.
**The {{ItemLink|Shipping Request Form}} spawns one [[Chests#Crashed Multishop "Delivery"|Crashed Multishop "Delivery"]] for every player/entity that possesses the form, including Lemurian allies. Since the rarity of the items provided in the shipment is determined by the total number of [[Shipping Request Form]] present before the stage starts, this can quickly result in large numbers of high quality deliveries. 
***Likewise, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Rusted Key}} spawns one [[Chests#Rusty Lockbox|Rusty Lockbox]] for every Lemurian holding one. However, their rarities do not scale and keys held by Lemurians cannot open the Lockboxes. It is still useful however if you encounter a large amount of [[Rusted Key]]s or wish to find the Lockboxes more easily.
*When a Lemurian ally dies, they will drop [[:Category:Scrap Items|Scrap Items]] matching the rarity of their Devoted Item. That item will also be removed from the Devoted Item Pool by as many stacks as the dead Lemurian's Devoted level plus 1. These stacks will be also be taken away instantly from any remaining Lemurian allies.

{{Clear}}
==Notes==
*The sacrificed items are all collected in a unified item pool distinct for each player. When an item is given, all Lemurian allies of that player will also receive a copy of it. Lemurian allies bound to other players will, however, not be affected.

==Tips==
*Be careful when fighting {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} Elites or opening a {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Cradle}} when the Lemurians are nearby, since infesting them can spell doom to both you and your followers.
**Similarly, Void Monsters spawned by a Void Seed or a [[Family Events|Family Event]] can quickly wipe out all of your allies.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Monsters can appear outside their usual environments.'''''

== Notes ==
*3 Basic Monsters, 3 Minibosses, 3 Champions, and all Special monsters will be chosen from the complete list of [[Directors#Categories|monster spawn cards]], with a few differences:
**{{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab|Hermit Crabs}} are excluded
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lunar Chimera (Golem)|altText=Lunar Chimera (Golems)}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|altText=Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}} are considered Minibosses
*The Special category has a weight of 1, while Basic Monsters, Minibosses and Champions have a weight of 3. Within each category all spawn cards are equally probable.
*No spawn cards have stage restrictions, which means the {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} can spawn before looping.
*{{Color|note|Bug:}} The {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scorch Worm}} can be selected even if the [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion is not active.
*This affects any [[Directors|Combat Directors]] which choose their spawns from the Environment's monster pool. As such, {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} monsters may not appear on {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}, and this also makes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixHaunted}} [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]] there possible, since Commencement is considered to be after looping.
**Any Directors which do not rely on the Environment's monster pool will not have their spawn cards overridden, e.g., the Escape Director responsible for spawning {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver|altText=Void Reavers}}, and the Voidling Director.
*Any fixed spawns, such as the 6 initial spawns on the second phase of the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} fight are not affected. However, the remaining spawns for the phase are, since they are spawned by a Combat Director.
*Normally one would never expect a [[Directors#Teleporter Boss|Horde of Many]] during the first few stages since the Champions are cheap (600 credits for the majority of them), but this Artifact completely changes this.
*At the beginning of each stage the game logs on the [[Developer Console|console]] which monsters have been selected for spawning.
*This artifact can make the first few stages harder since some monsters that normally appear later in a run tend to have more health and dangerous attacks.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact that spawns with a random equipment that changes every time it's activated.

== Notes ==
*The artifact will not change the equipment into:&lt;ref&gt;enigmaCompatible field on EquipmentDef&lt;/ref&gt;
**Any Elite Affix
**{{ItemLink|Effigy of Grief}}
**{{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}}
**{{ItemLink|Seed of Life}}
**{{ItemLink|Seed of Life (Consumed)}}
**{{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}
**{{ItemLink|Executive Card}}
**{{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}
*If a player loses their equipment somehow, such as by giving it to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}} or [[Cleansing Pool]] (in the case of lunar equipment), they will not receive new equipment afterward until they move to the next stage.
*Any entity's equipment activation is affected, including the{{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}} and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}}.
*The new equipment will be put on the cooldown of the activated equipment.
**{{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}} is given a cooldown of 5s but does not give a new equipment itself when toggled; the 5s would only apply to equipment that is picked up after The Crowdfunder is used.
*The {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} will fire, but will not show the charge-up animation (unless it randomizes into another Preon Accumulator).
** New equipment cannot be used while the Preon Accumulator is charging (with {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}}).
*The {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}} grants near-infinite flight for the entire stage when activated (do note, however, that said flight will automatically end upon a player either making ANY sort of feet-first contact with walkable level geometry, or by simply going outside in-game boundaries.)
*{{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}} is not affected by this Artifact.
*The{{ItemLink|Gnarled Woodsprite}} will heal the target but does not stay with them.
*If the player purchases anything while holding the {{ItemLink|Executive Card}}, it will count as being activated and be rerolled. Pressing the activate button with this item does nothing and will not reroll it.
* [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] is unaffected, even if the player attempts to "activate" it.
*This artifact is incorrectly labeled as "Artifact of Dissonance" if it is rolled while in the [[Simulacrum]]

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact that grants items to Monsters between stages.

== Notes ==
*Each stage, monsters obtain an item. The rarity of the items will be [[Items#Common|{{Color|Common}}]], Common, [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|Uncommon}}]], {{Color|Uncommon}}, [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|Legendary}}]], repeating every loop.
*The items monsters gain are cumulative; when advancing to the next stage, the monsters will keep all the items they already had in addition to the new item from the new stage.
*Monsters cannot gain [[:Category:AIBlacklist Items|blacklisted items]], [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill items]], [[:Category:SprintRelated Items|sprint-related items]], and [[:Category:EquipmentRelated Items|equipment-related items]]. They also cannot gain any [[Items#Boss|boss items]] or [[Items#Active Items|equipment]].
*Monsters will not normally gain [[Items#Lunar|lunar items]], but can acquire them if a player has {{ItemLink|Eulogy Zero}}.
**This makes it possible for the monsters to eventually be able to transform into the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}}.
*There is some inconsistency in what monsters gain items. In the data files most monsters are on team Monster. However, {{MonsterFamily|familyName=Void}} enemies, including the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor}} and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}}, are on team Void. Items are only granted to entities which belong to team Monster and are spawned by their [[Directors#Spawn Cards|Spawn Card]], whether it's the Director spawning them, or the game directly.
**Each [[Directors#The Combat Directors|Combat Director]] has a defined team, which overrides the Spawn Card's default team. The [[Directors#The Camp Director|Camp Director]] always spawns enemies on team Void, including [[Monsters#Voidtouched|Voidtouched]] enemies that would normally be on team Monster, so none of these will gain items. Every other Director spawns enemies on team Monster. This means that {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver|altText=Void Reavers}} spawned during normal gameplay and any Void enemies from a Void Invasion will gain items.
**The {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Artifact Reliquary}} and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Elder Lemurian|altText=Elder Lemurians}} in {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}} are not spawned by their Spawn Card, but from their game data directly and therefore they will not gain any items.
**The Voidling and the Void Infestor are on team Void and are not spawned by any Director, so they will not gain any items.
**[[Bazaar Between Time#Newt|Shopkeeper Newt]] is on team Neutral and is not spawned by any Director, so it will not gain any items.
*If the monsters gain a {{ItemLink|itemName=Shipping Request Form}}, every monster that has spawned as the starting monsters when entering a stage will also have its own corresponding [[Chests#Crashed Multishop "Delivery"|Crashed Multishop]]. The player can interact with these as normal, gaining many free items.
*The game rolls for a new item at the beginning of a new stage, even with the Artifact disabled. This is probably so that the game properly accumulates the items in the case the player visits Bulwark's Ambry at a later time.
*The game will roll for a new item only when the stage number increases. Since visiting most [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]] does not change this counter, a new item will not be rolled. For example, visiting the Bazaar Between Time afer the first stage will roll for a new item since leaving the first stage increments the stage counts. But leaving the Bazaar Between Time does not change this and will therefore still have two items after advancing to the next Environment.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Players always spawn as a random survivor.'''''

== Notes ==
*Upon entering the trial for this Artifact in {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}, each player becomes a random Survivor and will stay as that Survivor for the rest of the run (unless the trial is entered again in the same run).
*Skill-unlocking challenges are reset when a new Survivor is chosen, even if they were in progress before the trial.
*Obtaining all four items required to become the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} with this Artifact enabled will cause the player to spawn as a random Survivor with all four Heresy abilities at the start of each new stage. The player will transform into the Heretic mid-stage after obtaining or losing any item (including {{ItemLink|itemName=Defensive Microbots}} if spawning as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}}), activating their equipment, or having their equipment come off cooldown.
**Removing any of the four items required to become the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} at a [[Cleansing Pool]] will cause the player to regain the skills of the survivor they spawn as. This can be used to revert to a regular survivor after becoming the Heretic.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Descend to Petrichor V with gifts from a previous life.'''''
== Notes ==
[[File:HalcyonSeedRebirth.png|thumb|A {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}} pictured in the Artifact of Rebirth's tab when hovered over.]]
*Any item offered to the [[Shrine of Rebirth]] is automatically given to the player at the beginning of the the next run when this Artifact is active.
* The item offered can be any common, {{Color|Uncommon|uncommon}}, {{Color|Legendary|legendary}}, or {{Color|Boss|boss}} item with the exception of:
**Any [[:Category:Scrap Items|scrap items]]
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Defensive Microbots}}
*The Rebirth Item is single use only, but if the player can successfuly reach and defeat the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=False Son (Boss)}}, they can offer the same item to the Shrine to perpetuate its usage.
*The Rebirth Item given to any player in multiplayer can vary since it is directly linked to what item, if any, each player has personally offered to the Shrine before.
*If the current Rebirth Item is empty, a random common item will be given instead.
*This artifact is not unlocked using a code, but is instead unlocked after having donated an item to the Shrine of Rebirth at least once.
**In a multiplayer game this interaction unlocks the Artifact for everyone.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Monsters drop items on death, but Chests no longer spawn.''''' 

== Notes ==
*Drones, [[Scrapper]]s, [[3D Printers]], {{SotV|Void Cradle}}[[Void Cradle]]s (only in [[Void Seed]]s), and Shrines, with the exception of the [[Shrine of Chance]], will continue to spawn, as will the Rusty Lockbox generated by possessing a {{ItemLink|itemName=Rusted Key}} (same goes for the corrupted verison,{{ItemLink|itemName=Encrusted Key}})
*Using the Artifact of Honor to make all enemies Elite does not increase their drop rates.
*Since [[gold]] tends to pile up with this artifact active,{{ItemLink|itemName=The Crowdfunder}} can be a powerful and enjoyable piece of equipment.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} ''does not'' drop items with this Artifact enabled.
*Drop rates for item rarity are: 
**63% {{Color|#FFFFFF|Common}}
**27% {{Color|#00FF66|Uncommon}}
**0.9% {{Color|#FF0033|Legendary}}
**9% {{Color|#FF6633|Equipment}}
*Drop chance is not affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} or {{ItemLink|Purity}}.
*Predetermined chests, such as the [[Chests#Legendary Chest|Legendary Chest]] on {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}, the Chests on {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}, and the [[Chests|Legendary Chests]] on {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}, will still spawn with this Artifact active.

===Drop Chance===
The drop chance is equal to &lt;code&gt;0.05 * Log2(Max(1, Floor(creditCost * rewardMultiplier)) + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
*Or if Artifact of Swarms is enabled &lt;code&gt;0.05 * Log2(Max(1, Ceil(Floor(creditCost * rewardMultiplier) / 2)) + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
*See: [[Directors#Categories|creditCost]], ([[Directors#Monster .26 Elite tiers|elite's credit multiplier]]) and [[Directors#The Combat Directors|rewardMultiplier]] for more details on these values.

Notes on drop rate 
*Drop rates are changed when monsters spawn under certain conditions: 
**Pre-spawned: lowered by up to 8%
**Teleporter charging: lowered by up to 4.3% (Does not apply to TP Boss)
**Teleporter Boss: lowered by up to 16.6%
**Artifact of Swarms: lowered by up to 5%, in addition to any other change
*The drop chance cannot be less than 5%.

*{{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}, {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, {{EntityLink|Twisted Scavenger}} &lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt; and Umbrae from the Artifact of Vengeance have a drop chance of 0%.
*Though not listed above, Lunar Chimeras may drop items as well, and do so with significantly high rates.
*Drop chance is logged to the [[Modding|Console]] when a monster is killed.

Since drop chance cannot be lower than 5%, the Artifact of Swarms' drop chance reduction is less impactful against monsters that have low base drop chances. The following table shows some examples:

== Bugs ==
* There is a known bug where sometimes Sacrifice may fail to enable before a run even when it is selected (encountered on PC on Steam, needs to be verified on other platforms). Closing and reopening Risk of Rain 2 will fix this bug.&lt;sup&gt;needs verification&lt;/sup&gt;

{{MonsterPage|Lesser Wisp (Soul)}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact that makes a {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}} spawn after an enemy dies.

== Notes ==
*These Wisps do not drop gold or experience, and also slowly lose health over time.
*The Wisps are still vulnerable to being infested by {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}}.
*If Huntress's {{SkillLink|Laser Glaive|Huntress}} kills a monster, it will immediately ricochet to the Wisp spawned by the monster's death, consuming a bounce.
*The Wisps do not drop items if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Enemies drop multiple exploding bombs on death.'''''

== Notes ==
*Only enemies on the Monster team will drop bombs. This also includes {{MonsterFamily|familyName=Void}} monsters spawned during a [[Family Event]] and excludes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} monsters spawned by [[Void Seed]]s.
*The number of bombs a monster spawns is in most cases correlated to its size. More specifically, it is the height of its kinematic hitbox, but some monsters have a much smaller one than the monster's model suggests.
*There is a hard cap of 30 bombs that a monster can spawn, which is only achievable by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Imp Overlord}}. The  {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Grovetender}} comes second at 29.
*For higher number of bombs the chance increases that some of them will not spawn due to their density.
*The bombs will bounce twice, then detonate on the third bounce dealing 150% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.75 in a radius of 7m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]].

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Monster spawns are doubled, but monster maximum health is halved.'''''

== Notes ==
*Each monster also gives half of the usual [[gold]] and experience.
*Also doubles boss spawns, including {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|the final boss}}, the {{EntityLink|Twisted Scavenger|Twisted Scavengers}}, and the {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}
**When traveling to {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}} with this Artifact active, the two Twisted Scavengers spawned are not necessarily the same one.
*Also doubles the number of {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards|altImg=Beetle Guard (Ally)}} that spawn from {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}} and {{MonsterLink|Solus Probe|Solus Probes}} from {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}. 
**Since the Quiet and Delighted Probes spawned by the Empathy Cores scale in power based on the number of allies on the players' team, they become even more powerful.
**Aquiring a second stack of {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}} or  {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}} will &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; result in 4 allies. Gaining this second stack will instead give the player two full health followers.
*It does not, however, double any of the following:
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Artifact Reliquary}}
**The {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Elder Lemurian|altText=Elder Lemurians}} in {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct|Abandoned Aqueduct's}} secret area
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Halcyon Seed|altText=Aurelionite}} that spawns during the [[Teleporter]] to help the players
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Squid Polyp}}
**Ghosts created by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}}
**Lemurian devotees hatched with the {{ArtifactLink|Devotion}}

{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.5]]
*Resolved an issue where - when fighting the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|The False Son Boss}} with {{ArtifactLink|Swarms|Artifact of Swarms}} - the {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} event [[Challenges|achievement]] would unlock after only killing one of the bosses.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an artifact.

'''''Your relentless doppelganger will invade every 10 minutes.''''' 

== Notes ==
* A player's Umbra spawns with the same [[items]] and [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] as the player it copies, including hidden items such as [[DrizzlePlayerHelper]]. They all are named `Umbra of X`, where X is the name of a Survivor they're copying.
*Umbrae spawn near the [[Teleporter]] but in {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Bulwark's Ambry}} they spawn at a random location. In addition they get {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Hidden Invincibility}} for 3 seconds after spawning.
*For the Trial of Vengeance in Bulwark's Ambry, an Umbra for each player is spawned every time the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}} is interacted with, except the last interaction. 
** They will also be spawned in the same way during trials for any other Artifact, if the Artifact of Vengeance is active.
* Umbrae are considered bosses. Their health is displayed at the top of the screen, and they are susceptible to extra damage from {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}}.
*The screen has a deep purple tint while at least one Umbra is alive.
*Upon death, the Umbra drops one random item from its inventory, be it copied from a player or received from Artifact of Evolution. The Umbra will go through its invertory and assign a specific rarity weight for every eligible item. The result will be suspectible to the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]], as it is likely the Common items to overwhelm the other rarities. The weights are: 
**Common: 36.04%
**{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}: 9.01%
**{{Color|legendary|Legendary}}: 0.45%
**{{Color|boss|Boss}}: 4.5%
**{{Color|lunar|Lunar}}: 4.5%
**{{Color|void|Void}} Common: 36.04%
**{{Color|void|Void}} {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}: 9.01%
** {{Color|void|Void}} {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}: 0.45%
*If the Artifact of Swarms is also enabled, two Umbrae spawn with half the max health each. 
**Each Umbra will drop an item.
* There are certain items an Umbra cannot drop, even if they are their only items: 
**Any items that cannot be found in chests normally: {{ItemLink|itemName=Defensive Microbots}}, [[:Category:Scrap Items|scrap items]], and any [[Items#Untiered|untiered]] items. 
***For {{Color|Boss|boss}} items it is any items that cannot be obtained from an [[3D Printers#Overgrown 3D Printer|Overgrown 3D Printer]].
**{{ItemLink|Longstanding Solitude}}
*Umbrae are given a special item which reduces the damage they deal to 4% but increases their maximum health by 1000%. This item is also responsible for their appearance, the accompanying particle effects, the purple screen filter, and dropping an item on death. 
**Since {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets inherit all his items, they will also get this special item. This means that if a turret is still alive after the Engineer has been killed, the purple screen filter will persit until all entities holding the special item have been eliminated. However, the turrets do not drop an item when killed since they are minions.
**Due to their increased maximum health, any percentage-based healing is very potent on Umbrae. In particular, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets with {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} can become incredibly durable.  
***Extreme care should be taken when the player has {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}, as the item's damage is equal to 25% of the holder's maximum health. A turret with sufficient Fungus and N'kuhana's Opinion can easily wipe an entire team of players.
**Minions spawned by an Umbra's {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}, {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}} and {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}} do '''not''' receive this item, meaning they will deal full damage and can easily kill the player (as they scale with ambient level and usually have higher stats than regular monsters, for reference, Beetle Guards spawned by Queen's Gland deal 4 times the damage of a normal Beetle Guard.)
*Umbrae are considered allied with the monsters. Therefore, items like {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} are capable of healing any monsters that enter its radius.
*{{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} Umbra gets {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}}, which means he can cancel any projectiles, including any {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}} that the player has cast at the Umbra's spawning point to land just after the Umbra's arrival.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are game modifiers that may drastically alter some aspect of gameplay. Most Artifact codes can be found engraved on rectangular stone tablets scattered through the game (generally hidden), which must be inputted in a special event to unlock the corresponding Artifact. Once an Artifact is unlocked, the player can enable it at the start of a new run.

In multiplayer, the Artifacts unlocked by all players in the lobby are pooled; the team can enable or disable any Artifact that has been unlocked by any of the party members.

== Unlocking ==
To unlock an Artifact, the player must input an Artifact Code in {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} using the [[Sky Meadow#Compound Generator|Compound Generator]] below the map, then interact with the laptop. A portal to the trial for that Artifact in {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}} will spawn. The Compound Generator can also be found in {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}}, the alternative Stage 5 map.

The Compound Generator's inputs will cycle in the order: square, circle, triangle, diamond &lt;span style="font-family:monospace, monospace"&gt;(■ ● ▲ ♦).&lt;/span&gt;

In the Ambry, the Artifact whose trial is being attempted will be active (in addition to any other Artifacts that were enabled at the start of the run), and an {{ItemLink|Artifact Key}} will spawn on an elevated block in front of the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}. The player must pick up the Artifact Key and then interact with the Artifact Reliquary, which will cause monsters to start spawning. More Artifact Keys will randomly drop from killed monsters. Using an Artifact Key will remove them from all players' inventories, preventing players from hoarding keys.

Upon destroying the Artifact Reliquary, the Artifact can be taken and a portal to a [[Environments#First Stages|First Stage]] will appear.

==Trivia==
[[File:Artifact Credits.png|256px|thumb|Artifact design in the credits]]   
*In the credits, there is a whiteboard design of an Artifact. It has no use but possibly could in the future.&lt;ref&gt;https://discordapp.com/channels/417739215355510784/565729054620385280/743025898734747670&lt;/ref&gt;
*The {{ArtifactLink|Frailty}} is known internally as the Artifact of "Weak Ass Knees".
*Each shape of the artifact code is heavily implied to refer to each element mentioned in Bulwark's Ambry's logbook.  
**The mass is the sphere, design is the cube, blood is the tetrahedron, and soul is the octahedron.  Noticeably, the colors of the bright red tetrahedron and transparent octahedron correspond to the pillars of blood and soul found in the final stage of the game.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

Wielding a diverse armament of destructive skills, Artificer's strength lies in her devastating offense that can break through even the bulkiest of enemies, aided by the versatile {{Color|artificer|Snapfreeze}}. However, her power comes at the cost of survivability, as she has no defensive or movement skills aside from her high-flying {{Color|artificer|Ion Surge}}, so the player must be adept at dodging and be especially aware of their surroundings.

Completing the [[Pause.]] challenge will unlock Artificer as a playable survivor.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use special (Ion Surge)''': Artificer must be within 5m from the target. Because there is no programmed behavior to utilise the passive ability while in the air, the character will take fall damage when activating this skill.
# '''Use special (Flamethrower) and strafe''': Artificer must be within 16m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 3 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row. Since the is no implicit use for {{SkillLink|skillName=Ruin}} as the special skill, the character will be unable to utilise it.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': there are no distance requirements, but Artificer must have line of sight and be aiming at the target. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row and a target will be reselected after this. While the behavior is not selectable twice in a row, primary -&gt; chase for a brief moment -&gt; primary is valid.
# '''Use secondary and strafe''': Artificer must be within 25m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 3 seconds.
# '''Use utility''': Artificer must be within 25m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row and Artificer will sprint during this.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

==Tips==

* {{Color|Artificer}} is a burst damage survivor who deals massive damage with infrequent attacks. She makes excellent use of items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}}, or  {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1|altText=AtG Missiles}}, which increase her damage regardless of attack speed.
*While this used to not be the case, Artificer greatly benefits from attack speed buffing items, such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Soldier's Syringe}}, as it now passively reduces the cooldown for her primary, and with enough stacks, she can practically fire automatically.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band|altText=Runald's}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band|altText=Kjaro's Bands}} can benefit Artificer significantly since they massively increase the damage of her {{Color|artificer|Charged Nano-Bomb}} and {{Color|artificer|Cast Nano-Spear}}.
*Choosing between {{Color|artificer|Flame Bolt}} and {{Color|artificer|Plasma Bolt}} is dependent on playstyle. On one hand, {{Color|artificer|Flame Bolt}} offers greater single-target damage and provides a debuff for item synergy, while {{Color|artificer|Plasma Bolt}} is more forgiving in terms of accuracy and offers better AoE capability.
*Because of Artificer’s limited attack charges, attacking too quickly can leave you defenseless while your abilities reload.
*{{Color|Artificer}}'s secondary options make up the majority of her damage. {{Color|artificer|Charged Nano-Bomb}} has more damage, is more forgiving, and provides better AoE, while {{Color|artificer|Cast Nano-Spear}} has the powerful {{Color|u|freezing}} effect, isn't affected by gravity, and is stronger against the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}}.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Backup Magazine|altText=Backup Magazines}} are great on {{Color|Artificer}}, since they allow her to use her secondary more often. With {{Color|artificer|Cast Nano-Spear}}, enough stacks can trivialize the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}} by repeatedly {{Color|u|freezing}} him.
**Both secondaries can be charged while sprinting, which is crucial for maintaining damage output while dodging attacks.

*{{Color|artificer|Flamethrower}} provides a use for many items which aren't otherwise useful for {{Color|Artificer}}, like {{ItemLink|itemName=Soldier's Syringe}} and  {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}} . These can bolster its damage and even allow a more traditional playstyle based around on-hit items.
*{{Color|artificer|Flamethrower}} has short range and can't be used while sprinting which might make it feel risky to use in certain scenarios.
**In a 1-on-1 scenario, by using {{Color|artificer|Snapfreeze}} on the target and then aligning the survivor along the wall's line before activating {{Color|artificer|Flamethrow}} ensures that the moment the enemy unfreezes and tries to charge at the player, they will get frozen again, completely nullifying the attack's range and mobility drawbacks.

*Taking {{Color|artificer|Ion Surge}} exchanges {{Color|artificer|Flamethrower}} for a versatile mobility option, which can be used for looting, scouting, and escaping deadly situations. It's particularly effective against the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}}, which struggles to hit {{Color|Artificer}} while she's in the air. 
**While taking {{Color|artificer|Ion Surge}} does lower {{Color|Artificer}}'s damage somewhat, this can be offset through good use of her secondary and by prioritizing items which synergize with her burst damage playstyle.
**Even with {{Color|artificer|Ion Surge}} and {{Color|artificer|ENV Suit}}, it's generally best to spend most of combat on the ground. While grounded, you have more flexible movement options, can take advantage of cover, and can hit your attacks more easily. It's usually best to save {{Color|artificer|Ion Surge}} as an escape option when you feel threatened, then quickly return to the ground to continue the fight from a better position.

*Each pillar of {{Color|artificer|Snapfreeze}} hurts and {{Color|u|freezes}} enemies individually. This means that it can be used defensively to buy time to flee from multiple pursuing enemies, or to focus damage on a single important target by luring it into multiple pillars, {{Color|u|freezing}} it repeatedly for easy damage.
**This also means that {{Color|artificer|Snapfreeze}} is useful even against boss enemies that can't be {{Color|u|frozen}}, as they're large enough that they can take damage from many of the pillars.
*{{Color|artificer|Cast Nano-Spear}} and {{Color|artificer|Snapfreeze}} cannot {{Color|u|freeze}} most bosses, but can {{Color|u|freeze}} and even execute the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}}.
*If you use {{Color|artificer|Flame Bolt}} or {{Color|artificer|Flamethrower}},  {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} can be an excellent item, as it dramatically increases the damage of the affected attacks.
*Pressing the jump key while in the air will not activate the {{Color|Artificer|ENV Suit}} if the player has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Hopoo Feather|altText=Hopoo Feathers}} until all extra jumps have been exhausted. However, pressing and holding the jump key will consume one jump and then activate the passive skill. This is because a jump is only executed when the key is initially pressed.
*{{Color|Artificer}} can struggle against small flying enemies because of her delayed attacks. Area of effect items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} can help clear the skies while {{ItemLink|itemName=Lens-Maker's Glasses}} paired with {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} can help guarantee one-shots on {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lesser Wisp|altText=Lesser Wisps}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Blind Pest|altText=Blind Pests}}.

*Because {{Color|Artificer}} doesn't have a horizontal movement ability, mobility items and strafing skills are extremely important to help dodge attacks. Always keep moving in combat, as moving even a little will dramatically reduce the damage you take.

*All of Artificer's challenge skills can be unlocked at once by enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Kin|Artifacts of Kin}} and {{ArtifactLink|Swarms|Swarms}}. Repeatedly restart the run until the first stage's chosen monster is {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle|altText=Beetles}}, then take the {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Array}} from the [[Escape Pod]]. Activate the [[Teleporter]], round up at least 20 Beetles (including all those from the Horde of Many), and die from the Fuel Array's explosion. This will kill all the Beetles at once, which will clear both the Chunked and Massacre challenges. Since the player's body is launched into the sky by the Fuel Array's explosion, this also will clear the Orbital Bombardment challenge.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} by fully defeating a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]] in a one-second burst of damage. 

== Notes ==
* This hidden timer begins when the player first damages the boss, ''not'' when it is spawned.

* In multiplayer, other players can assist the Artificer player or even complete the challenge for them.

== Tips ==
* The use of {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn|Trophy's Hunter's Tricorn}} makes this challenge trivial by killing the Teleporter Boss in a single hit
** Note that the Tricorn itself does not count as "damage" and as such using the item without first dealing some damage to the boss will *not* unlock the achievement. A single hit is all that is necessary before using the item in order to unlock the achievement.

* As the [[difficulty]] of a run increases, it becomes less and less likely that only a single enemy will spawn as a Teleporter Boss. Playing on {{EntityLink|entityName=Drizzle}} ensures that the difficulty scales as slowly as possible, since this challenge becomes much more difficult when multiple bosses spawn.

* The {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} quintuples the player's damage output, so consider enabling it when attempting to complete this challenge.
**When paired with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}, the player can repeatedly stack {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} in the first stage. With enough Crowbars, a single {{SkillLink|Charged Nano-Bomb|Artificer}} can defeat a boss in one hit.
*One way of getting this challenge would be to get the {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} from the [[Rallypoint Delta#Timed Security Chest|Timed Security Chest]] while getting damage items such as {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}}, {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} and {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}. Timing the Preon Accumulator with a Charged Nano-Bomb can deal severe enough damage to defeat the boss instantly.

* Another viable option is enable the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}, then restart runs until the first stage's Teleporter Boss drops a Yellow Command Essence, which should be turned into a {{ItemLink|itemName=Genesis Loop}}. If the player has stacked Armor-Piercing Rounds and Crowbars in the first and second stages, they can activate the second stage's Teleporter and allow themself to be attacked repeatedly. Once the Genesis Loop's explosion triggers, it should handily wipe out the boss in a single hit.
**Consider using this method in a multiplayer game so that the first stage's Teleporter drops multiple items instead of just one, increasing the chance to obtain a boss item.
**Although this method will likely require multiple resets, the player will not need to spend any [[Lunar Coins]].
*Another option is to use the [[H3AD-5T v2]] which can combinded with [[Ocular HUD]] to theortically to deal 20000% base damage if used at max height. This can be achieved by hovering a repeatibly using Ion Surge to gain height up to the world limit then activating H3AD-5T v2.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} by performing a multikill of 20 [[Monsters|enemies]].

A multikill is a streak of enemies killed; if a full second passes without a kill, the streak is reset.

==Tips==
* Using a {{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} is a great way to gather enemies together and setup a big multikill. Combine it with several {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} for maximum effectiveness.

* Playing on a higher [[difficulty]] will scale the number of enemies faster, which can make getting multikills easier at the cost of making it more difficult to survive.

* The {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} and {{ArtifactLink|Soul}} can be useful for increasing the number of monsters.

* This challenge can also be completed using the {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} with at least 2 {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}. Each doll will trigger 8 kills spaced 1 second apart, so staggering the dolls slightly keeps the multikill counter going, for 24 kills total. 

* The item {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}} makes it rather easy to complete this challenge, causing large multikills when the player reaches low health.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} by killing 15 [[Monsters|enemies]] before touching the ground.

== Tips ==
* Using Artificer's {{SkillLink|ENV Suit|Artificer}} to hover in the air after jumping from a high point can give enough time to kill 15 enemies before touching the ground.

* Items like {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather|altText=Hopoo Feathers}} and {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}} can help the player stay in the air longer.

* Using an {{ItemLink|itemName=Eccentric Vase}} can create a quantum tunnel straight up, allowing Artificer to gain incredible height.
* A {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please|altText=Forgive Me Please}} with a {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cell}} can trivialise this challenge given a high enough ledge, as two uses of Forgive Me Please register as 16 kills.
* A more permanent but effective approach is utilizing [[Artifact of Kin]] and getting the [[Beetle]] monster type. Then, grab the [[Fuel Array]] at the back of the escape pod and purposefully get hit. Eventually, once reaching below 50% HP it will start to combust and right before it does, jump. If done correctly, you should acquire it.
** You can complete all of Artificer's challenges simultaneously if you add the teleporter boss to this strategy and murder 20 beetles with the resulting explosion while off the ground (ensuring all the boss beetles are caught in the blast)

The '''AtG Missile Mk. 1''' is a [[Ror:AtG Missile Mk. 1|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

On hitting an enemy, the player has a 10% chance to launch a homing missile that deals 300% ''(+300% per stack)'' [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|total damage]] with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. This chance to trigger is multiplied by the proc coefficient of the attack.  

== Notes ==

* This item is extremely powerful on any character when stacked, especially in combination with other total damage items such as the {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}}, and {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}}. 
* Two AtGs is enough to activate {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} and {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} with almost any attack, making these items viable for [[Survivors]] who don't have a high-damage skill.
*AtGs will [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] if the hit that fired the missle is also a [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]]. Therefore AtGs will benefit from the effects of {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}  and {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}.
&lt;!-- Is this tip actually correct? The AtG deals total damage, not base damage, so I'm not sure this is strictly true if the missile is triggered by a weak attack. --&gt;

That is, if you have a proc that deals 300% damage from an attack that hits for 100, it will hit for 300. Previously it was a complicated additive formula - this change is either neutral or a buff for every character, and GREATLY benefits slow, high-damage attacks like the Artificer’s.''

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Boss]] Monster found only in the {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}. The player can travel to the Gilded Coast by activating an [[Altar of Gold]], which can rarely spawn on any standard [[Environments|Environment]], and entering the resulting Gold Portal. Alternatively, the Gilded Coast can rarely appear in the [[Bazaar Between Time#Lunar Seer|Lunar Seer]] in the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}. 

Aurelionite appears mostly identical to a {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan}}, but she is brilliant gold, has a pair of horns, and wields a massive golden sword.  In order for Aurelionite to spawn, the player must pay to activate the Halcyon Beacons located all around the islands. Although Aurelionite will spawn after four beacons are activated, she will be invincible until every beacon is active. While she is invulnerable, she can not be killed with the [[Trophy Hunter's Tricorn]]. After a period of vulnerability, the beacons will deactivate again and must be reactivated to damage Aurelionite again.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Most of Aurelionite's skills and behavior are identical to that of a Stone Titan's.

=== Secondary: Stone Sword ===
Similar to the [[Stone Titan|Stone Titan's]] [[Stone Titan#Secondary: Stone Fist|secondary]], but instead of 1 fire ring, she fires 6 in a line, each spaced 10m apart each and centered at the predicted location. The fire rings explode after 1 second, at 0.1s intervals each and deal the same amount of damage in a 7m radius.

Due to the blast radius and the distance between the rings, a target may get hit by two blasts if they are standing in the overlap.

=== Utility: Stone Construct ===
This is exactly the same as the [[Stone Titan|Stone Titan's]] [[Stone Titan#Utility: Stone Construct|utility]].

=== Special: Eye Laser ===
The laser beam is the same as the [[Stone Titan|Stone Titan's]] [[Stone Titan#Special: Eye Laser|special]].

In addition to this, she will fire 24 of the homing laser projectiles that are fired from her utility skill, each dealing 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 2m with no falloff.

While these projectiles are homing, they are fired in a wide spread and may miss the target. If the target is near Aurelionite on the ground, the explosion blasts are more dangerous.

=== Behaviors ===
Aurelionite's behaviors are exactly the same as the [[Stone Titan#Behaviors|Stone Titan's]], and she will smash you into dust if you aren't prepared.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}''

As a reward for defeating Aurelionite, a {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}} will drop for each player.

'''Aurelionite's Blessing''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|AffixAurelionite|Gilded}} [[Monsters#Gilded|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Gilded Elite, but this chance is affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with Aurelionite's Blessing gains the power of a Gilded Elite; knock gold out of enemies and occasionaly manifest an attack that appears under their feet. The mechanics of this power have some distinct differences when held by a player compared to a monster or a drone.

* The player manually activates the ranged attack where they are aiming. This is the only Elite equipment that has a manual activation and as such it can benefit from additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} and other cooldown reduction effect, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}}.
* When the player hits an enemy, the gold knocked out is always one nugget for &lt;math&gt;8 \times diffCoeff^{1.25}&lt;/math&gt; gold. However, the chance of proccing this is affected by the attack's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]].
** Upon proccing it, there is a cooldown of 0.5 seconds before it can be procced again.

==Tips==

* Since any attacks can generate more gold for the holder, it is like having {{ItemLink|itemName=Brittle Crown}} without any of its side effects.
* An [[Equipment Drone]] behaves like a monster with this power, but in addition it can also manually activate the equipment. It is possible to have two instances of the ranged attack active at the same time; one from the automatic targetting and one from activating the equipment.
* Be aware when using this equipment with the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} in conjunction with {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}}, since the projectile can spawn in front of you if you're aiming at the ground and the outer torus of the attack can friendly fire.

The '''Backup Magazine''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.  

The item grants the holder 1 extra charge ''(+1 per stack)'' of their secondary, or "M2" skill.  

== Notes ==

* This item is especially strong when used with characters with powerful and/or low-cooldown secondary skills.

* This item increases the maximum amount of {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} mines that can be placed.

* Unlike the {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}} and {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}}, this item does ''not'' reduce the cooldown of the secondary skill.

* Having multiple Backup Magazines allows the player to quickly use multiple charges of their secondary skill back to back, and increased attack speed makes these multiple charges come out even faster. This burst potential is easier to obtain than reducing skill cooldowns to the minimum of 0.5 seconds through {{ItemLink|Purity}} or {{ItemLink|Brainstalks}}, although cooldown reduction is still effective for reloading the charges.

* This item affects {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T|altText=MUL-T's}} secondary fire when in {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}}, although it can only be utilized by {{SkillLink|skillName=Scrap Launcher|survivorName=MUL-T}}.

* This item lets {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} fire additional consecutive shots while scoped in with {{SkillLink|skillName=M99 Sniper|survivorName=Railgunner}} before having to reload. However, with {{SkillLink|skillName=HH44 Marksman|survivorName=Railgunner}}, this item is functionally useless.

== Trivia ==
* Upon picking up his first Backup Magazine, {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} seems to attach it on the magazine of both of his guns.
* The visuals of this item are based on the real life "[[wikipedia:Jungle_style|jungle style]]" arrangement of magazines.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

A swift and sneaky fighter, the Bandit focuses on keeping on the move to catch enemies off guard and deal ruinous damage, before finishing the job with {{SkillLink|skillName=Lights Out}}. Between his daggers, smoke bombs, and gun attacks, the Bandit emphasizes mobility and versatility but also requires some skill to bring out his true potential.

Completing the [[Warrior]] challenge will unlock Bandit as a playable survivor.

* Only lateral direction is considered; how much a target may be looking upwards or downwards at the time is irrelevant.

* Provides a small speed boost for the duration of the ability.
* Using any skill during the ability will instantly make Bandit exit invisibility, triggering the second hit as normal. Activating an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] will not.
* Using Smoke Bomb again while still invisible will cause Bandit to end the first Smoke Bomb's effects, momentarily becoming visible, before starting the effects of the second as normal.

** Since kills are tracked with a buff, all bonus damage is lost upon advancing to the next stage or by being revived with {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} or {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}}.
* Each stack of the buff increases Desperado's total damage by 10%, so each provides a 60% base damage boost.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use secondary (Dagger)''': Bandit must be within 5m from the target. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Close in for secondary (Dagger)''': Bandit must be within 14m from the target. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds and Bandit will sprint during this. This is Bandit's attempt to get within skill range while all other skills are on cooldown.
# '''Use special and stop''': Bandit must be within 6-60m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 0.25 seconds.
# '''Use primary (Burst) and strafe''': Bandit must be within 6-30m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use special to flee''': Bandit must be 8m from the target. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and Bandit will sprint. A target will be reselected after this.
# '''Use special to chase''': there are no distance requirements. This behavior is active for 2.9 seconds, cannot be chosen twice in a row, and Bandit will sprint. A target will be reselected after this.
# '''Use secondary (Shiv)''': Bandit must be within 18m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it.
# '''Use primary (Blast)''': Bandit must be within 10-50m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.15 seconds.
# '''Use secondary ({{SkillLink|skillName=Slicing Maelstrom}})''': Bandit must be within 30m from the target and have line of sight.
# '''Use primary ({{SkillLink|skillName=Hungering Gaze}})''': Bandit must be within 10-50m from the target and have line of sight.
# '''Flee when close''': Bandit must be within 14m from the target. A new target will selected after this.
# '''Strafe when close''': Bandit must be within 20m from the target and a new target will be selected after this. Due to the previous behavior to flee when close, this behavior is effectively only selected for a 14-20m range.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* {{Color|bandit|Burst}} and {{Color|bandit|Blast}} can be shot as fast as the player can click/press the corresponding button. Items increasing attack speed like {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|altText=Soldier's Syringes}} only speed up the reload of the gun.

* {{Color|bandit|Burst}} and {{Color|bandit|Blast}}  reload faster if {{Color|bandit|Bandit's}} gun is empty, rather than if there are bullets remaining in the chamber.

* {{Color|bandit|Burst}} does not pair well with items like {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}} and {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger|alt= Tri-Tip Daggers}}, because the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} stacks wear off during his reload animation. However, it's possible to collect enough {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|alt= Soldier's Syringes}} or {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts|alt= }} to negate this issue.

* Rapid-firing {{Color|bandit|Burst}} and {{Color|bandit|Blast}} drastically increases the spread of the weapons. Pacing shots is necessary for hitting targets at longer ranges.

* Both {{Color|bandit|Serrated Dagger}} and {{Color|bandit|Serrated Shiv}} reset {{Color|bandit|Bandit's}} vertical aerial momentum, which can be used to prevent fall damage.

* Like {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}, when a new stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SuperBleeding}} is applied, all existing stacks on that target are "refreshed", with their durations becoming equal to the newest stack. This means that {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SuperBleeding}} can be infinitely stacked, as long as it is reapplied within 15s.
**Ignoring their durations, a single stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SuperBleeding}} has 1.67 times the DPS of a single stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}.

* While {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cloak|altText=invisible}} from the {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}}, enemies will still obtain updates on bandit's location, but only every few seconds instead of constantly.

* Use {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}} to get the most use out of {{Color|bandit|Bandit's}} {{Color|bandit|Backstab}} passive, allowing the player to reposition behind enemies while they're unaware.

* Since {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}} moves {{Color|bandit|Bandit}} upward while in the air, it can effectively be used as an extra jump to increase mobility or to prevent fall damage.

* Using a skill to exit {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}} early while airborne will make {{Color|bandit|Bandit}} perform a mid-air jump from {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}} ending.

* {{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} is activated when anything with a health bar is killed. This includes non-sentient targets, such as the explosive containers in {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}, the flying rocks in {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}, and the destructible projectile attacks of {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}} and {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}}.
**Destroying the pots/rocks makes completing the [[Bandit: Classic Man|Classic Man]] challenge considerably easier.
**On the other hand, {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} does require a sentient target to be killed in order for a {{StatusEffectLink|BanditSkull}} token to be granted.

*{{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} and {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} are affected by {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|alt= Soldier's Syringes}}. Increasing {{Color|bandit|Bandit's}} attack speed will cause these attacks to come out faster, allowing for quickly dispatching many enemies consecutively.
**As a result, temporary attacks speed buffs such as those from {{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron|alt= }} and {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts|alt= }} can actually become problematic for {{Color|bandit|Bandit}}. They may cause inconsistencies with how fast these attacks fire and throw off the player's rhythm.
*{{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} and {{Color|bandit|Desperado's}} on-kill effects are also granted to the {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}. If an enemy is killed by the explosion generated from either skill (rather than the skill itself), the corresponding on-kill effect will still activate. 
** As a result, more than one stack of{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BanditSkull}} can be received with a single use of the {{Color|bandit|Desperado}}.

*Pair the {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} with {{Color|bandit|Desperado}}, as the Bandolier can compensate for the lost ability to reset cooldowns.

*Given {{Color|bandit|Desperado's}} low cooldown, it can be effective to pair it with a {{ItemLink|Purity|alt= }} in the early stages to increase windows for stacking the skill, and overall damage. This comes at the cost of almost all chance-based effects, however.

*Bizarrely, {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}} increases its number of hits the more players there are. One use of {{Color|bandit|Smoke Bomb}} in 4-player game can hit more than 4 times, while it can hit only once in a singleplayer game. This is likely a bug.

*Many [[Items#Void|void items]] are unusually strong with {{Color|bandit|Bandit}}. 
**{{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} benefits both {{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} and {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} extremely well; in addition to simply recharging faster, {{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} refreshes '''all''' of its charges on a kill, making it significantly more spammable with multiple stacks.
**{{ItemLink|Singularity Band}} and {{ItemLink|Needletick}} deal their damage some time after being initially triggered, allowing one to more easily finish off an enemy using   {{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} or {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} without another effect "stealing" the kill.
***As a bonus, the Singularity Band restricts enemy movement, holding them in place to line up the perfect shot. This also makes the Brilliant Behemoth even more effective, as a single shot will hit most if not all of the enemies caught by the Singularity Band.
**{{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}} can be taken without too much detriment, as {{Color|bandit|Bandit}} can force critical hits using his {{Color|bandit|Backstab}} passive, and thus still gain some benefit from most other crit items such as the {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}.

== Trivia==
*Bandit was one of the original playable characters in the first Risk of Rain.
* Bandit's "Chilly" skin is a reference to Ibzan - the main antagonist of Hopoo's other game, [https://hopoogames.com/deadbolt/ DEADBOLT]. The skin bears a close resemblance to him, the name refers to the constant cold that skeletons feel, the shotgun model is replaced with a Semi-Auto Shotgun and the knives are replaced with kitchen knives.
*Before the Anniversary update, Bandit was in the game's files as an unused survivor. Notably, he was the most complete unused survivor.
* 657 stacks of {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} would be needed to rival the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|survivorName=Captain}} with 40,020% damage per shot.
* Currently, there is a bug involving the {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} where any extra charges of {{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} or {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} are wasted if the special key is pressed before the bullet from the first special use is fired. This makes spamming the special key detrimental to activating {{Color|bandit|Lights Out}} or {{Color|bandit|Desperado}} multiple times in a row.
*Based on his Logbook Entry, Bandit snuck aboard while disguised as a crew member in order to steal from the wreckage of the Contact Light and sell off his stolen goods.
*Bandit appears to be ambidextrous, due to his ability to hold his shotgun in his right hand while being able to fire his revolver in his left hand.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} by killing  {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=Mithrix}} or {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling|altText=Voidling}} with {{SkillLink|Lights Out|Bandit}}. Keep in mind, killing  {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=Mithrix}} in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] won't count towards [[Challenges|challenge]] completion.

== Tips ==
* The player must be careful to not accidentally kill the final boss with item effects instead of Lights Out itself. Items to avoid include {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Singularity Band}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, and all ally-spawning items such as the {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}. Damage-over-time effects like the {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}} and {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}} should also be avoided.
* Defensive items like {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}, {{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit}}, and {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}} can be taken into the fight, but may hinder getting the kill. 
* Be wary of bringing on-kill items like {{ItemLink|Gasoline}} and {{ItemLink|Ceremonial Dagger}} when holding ally-spawning items. When the boss steals items, he will spawn his own allies, and killing them will activate on-kill effects that might end up stealing the kill.
* The challenge can be made easier using the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}}, as there will be two copies of the final boss. Killing either one with Lights Out will complete the challenge, so the artifact effectively grants the player an additional attempt, but at the cost of dodging twice as many attacks.
* Playing on [[Drizzle]] can help keep the health of the final boss low.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} by successfully resetting cooldowns with {{SkillLink|Lights Out|Bandit}} 15 times in a row.

== Tips ==
* The only way to break a streak of resets is to use Lights Out and not kill a target with it. Time passing between attacks, or using other skills between uses of Lights Out, will ''not'' interfere.
** However, the achievement tracker is also reset when the player respawns, either from the effect of {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}}/{{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}} or transitioning to the next stage.
* Use Bandit's other skills to whittle down monsters before finishing them off with Lights Out. Remember that there is no time pressure, so be patient and methodical; if a monster seems to be outside the killing range for Lights Out, either leave it be or defeat it (without using Lights Out) and find a new prospective target.
* Gathering {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} can allow Bandit to kill weak [[monsters]] such as {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle|altText=Beetles}} in one shot with Lights Out. Since these small monsters generally spawn in large groups, they are prime candidates for attempting this challenge.
** If the {{ArtifactLink|Soul}} is active, weak Wisps will emerge from slain monsters, giving an easy target to follow up on after killing a monster.
* Enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} can greatly help with this challenge, as all enemies will have half the normal health.
* Destroying the explosive containers in {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}, or the flying rocks in {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} also counts towards the achievement. Since the flying rocks spawn continuously, the player is given infinite attempts to unlock the achievement especially after the completion of the [[Teleporter|Teleporter Event]] when monsters stop spawning.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} by killing a monster with 20 stacks of{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SuperBleeding}}.

== Tips ==
* A monster with a lot of HP, most likely a boss, will be required for this challenge. Players might need to wait for later stages in order to find an adequate target. [[Shrine of the Mountain|Shrines of the Mountain]] can help summon stronger [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Bosses]] early on, although it is more likely that multiple bosses will be spawned instead of an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]].
** A possible target is the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}. It is incredibly defensive and able to survive multiple stacks of Hemorrhage without dying before the required stacks can be applied.
**Playing on higher [[Difficulty#Initial Difficulty|difficulty]] will make monsters stronger faster, saving some time but requiring more skill.
**The {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} will force all bosses to spawn as Elites, guaranteeing they will have much more health. However, they will be more difficult to survive against.

* In multiplayer, multiple Bandits can work together to stack hemorrhage on a single enemy. Each Bandit player must apply at least one stack of hemorrhage to be eligible for the completion of the challenge.
* {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|altText=Backup Magazines}} will greatly help by stacking uses of {{SkillLink|Serrated Dagger|Bandit}}.
** {{SkillLink|Lights Out|Bandit}} resets all of Bandit's cooldowns, including every additional use gained by {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|alt=Backup Magazines}}. 4-9 Magazines can be enough with proper resets.

* Having 2 {{ItemLink|Purity|altText=Purities}} will reduce the cooldown of Serrated Dagger to 1 second, allowing the player to spam the attack repeatedly. (A third would lower it further to the minimum of 0.5 seconds, though this is overkill.)

* {{ItemLink|Brainstalks}} also helps with spamming Serrated Dagger, which should give extra time to stack most of the necessary Hemorrhage stacks.
** This is especially reliable when using the Artifact of Honor.

* Serrated Dagger only causes hemorrhaging on critical strikes, so {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} or {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD}} can help negate the need to perform backstabs to apply stacks of Hemorrhage.
** Stacking a few {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} can increase the uptime of the HUD to be more consistent.
** Add a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} to greatly reduce the HUD's cooldown and eliminate the need to micro-manage it.
* While not as important as cooldown or critical chance, attack speed does increase the speed at which the player can repeatedly use Serrated Dagger. Stacking hemorrhage quickly will prevent the enemy from dying before 20 stacks are reached.
*By using the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}, you can select the items needed to be unlock this achievement. Selecting 7+ {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|alt=Backup Magazines}}, 9 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, 1 {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}}, 3+ {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}, and many survivability items can make this achievement significantly easier.
*In Russian localization the words "Bleed" and "Hemorrage" are translated into the same word, "Кровотечение", leading to a misunderstanding.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder kills an enemy, there is an 18% ''(+10% per stack)'' chance that the enemy will drop an ammo pack. When collected, the ammo pack resets all skill cooldowns.

== Notes ==
* Any ally (including non-player allies) can collect the ammo pack, not just the player who has the Bandolier. 
** Although if a Monster such as a {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} drops its own ammo pack, only Monsters can pick it up, you and all allies cannot interact with it.
* For skills that have multiple charges, such as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets or secondary skills with {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}}, an ammo pack will refresh whatever one full recharge grants, usually only one charge, and the next charge will start from full cooldown.
** The exceptions to this are {{SkillLink|skillName=Hungering Gaze|survivorName=Heretic}}, granted by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Visions of Heresy}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Scrap Launcher}} since these skills recover ''all'' stacks at once when their cooldown finishes.
* The drop chance is affected by [[Luck]].
* Picking up an ammo pack does ''not'' reset [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] cooldown.

== Tips ==
* Activating the {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} with a Bandolier drops up to 8 ammo packs.
* While the Bandolier does help all survivors, melee [[survivors]], such as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, and {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} will benefit greatly from this item, as these survivors have powerful abilities that can be used to defeat an enemy while simultaneously collecting the dropped ammo pack, thus letting them use strong skills many times in quick succession.

==Math==
The chance to drop an ammo pack is determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;1 - 1 / (1 + x) ^ {0.33}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''x'' being the amount of bandoliers.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] that spawns on almost all [[Environments]]. It contains 8 [[gold]] and 4 [[Level|XP]] that can be retrieved by opening it. This amount scales linearly with the [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]] and is decided by the value of the coefficient when entering the stage, not when opening the barrel.

Since money-costing interactables scale [[Difficulty#Effect on money costs|exponentially]] with the difficulty coefficient, the relative reward of a barrel compared to the cost of a chest falls off quickly with time. Against a small chest, for example, at the beginning of the game on Easy Difficulty the ratio is roughly equal to 1/3, and then drops off to approximately 1/4 and 1/5 for the Hard and Impossible difficulties respectively.

Beside the little resources they provide, barrels can be used to launch {{ItemLink|Bundle of Fireworks|altText=Fireworks}} or spawn {{ItemLink|Squid Polyp|altText=Squid Polyps}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a Hidden Realm [[Environments|Environment]] that can be accessed by entering a Blue Portal that appears next to the [[Teleporter]].

This stage serves as the shop in Risk of Rain 2. Players can purchase various [[Items]] with [[Lunar Coins]] or exchange items for higher-rarity ones in two crucibles. The time and difficulty meters are paused while the player is in this map.

== Blue Portal ==
[[File:Blue Portal.jpg|thumb|A Blue Portal]]
The Blue Portal can spawn in two ways:
# Spending a Lunar Coin at a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]].
# Having it spawn naturally on stage creation. There's an initial 5% chance for a stage to spawn a portal, but this chance decreases as more portals are spawned through either method.

Regardless of however the portal appears, a small, trailing blue orb will orbit the Teleporter and the text "A blue orb appears" will notify players that a portal will spawn once the Teleporter event is completed.

The chance for a Blue Portal to spawn in a stage is &lt;code&gt;0.05 / (blue portals opened + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;!-- 0.375 is the value in code, but is overriden to 0.05 by editor at load --&gt;

On Stage 5, regardless of the Teleporter's alignment, going through the Blue Portal (or any portal) will cause the player to loop back to Stage 1.

{{Clear}}

==Green Portal==
The [[Halcyon_Shrine#Green_Portal|Green Portal]] can spawn on the bridge between the spawning area and the shop. An optional mission needs to be completed in order for the portal to spawn, which is only available if the player has the [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion, they have not already reached stage 4, they have not already completed this mission in the current [[Environments#Looping|loop]] (this resets every loop), and the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} has not been defeated yet. This can be used as an alternative way to enter the Path of the Collosus and reach its final boss.

3 Mini Geodes have to be destroyed which spawn in the area with the Blue Portal and on the path to the Null Portal. They can be found randomly in any of the following 9 possible locations.

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

{{Clear}}

==Newt==
{{MonsterPage|Newt}}
Newt, the shopkeeper, watches the player in the shop. It can be attacked, but after a certain amount of damage is dealt, Newt will teleport the player outside the bazaar and seal it, preventing access until another return through a Blue Portal. If Newt’s health is brought to 0 before this occurs, Newt will disappear and the Bazaar will remain accessible. Bringing Newt's health to 0 does not "kill" it or significantly affect the game, and Newt will be in the shop the next time the Bazaar is visited.

While Newt does have scaling stats, Newt spawns on the Neutral team at level 1. Newt does not have a death animation, but his body will disappear once defeated after a period of time. 

Newt does not have a corresponding logbook entry. Successfully killing it will never yield a logbook.

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
===Special: KickFromShop ===
Newt charges up before stomping, sending all players out of the shop and sealing the entrance.

This skill is used when Newt's health reaches under 99% of its combined health.{{Clear}}

==Lunar Buds==
[[File:Lunar Buds.png|frameless|right|128px|Lunar Buds]]
Newt offers a random selection of 5 [[Items#Lunar|{{Color|lunar|Lunar}}]] items costing {{LunarCoin|2}} that can only be purchased once each. Only items already unlocked by any of the players in the run can appear.

{{Clear}}
==Lunar Shop Refresher==
[[File:Lunar Shop Refresher.png|frameless|right|128px|Lunar Shop Refresher]]
The Lunar Shop Refresher allows the player to reroll all the remaining Lunar Buds of the shop. Each reroll will cost some Lunar Coins, starting at price of {{LunarCoin|1}} and doubling each time with no limit ({{LunarCoin|1}}/{{LunarCoin|2}}/{{LunarCoin|4}}/{{LunarCoin|8}}/{{LunarCoin|16}}/etc). 

Lunar Buds that have already been purchased will not be replenished.

{{Clear}}

==Cauldrons==
[[File:Red Cauldron.png|frameless|right|128px|Red Cauldron]]
The trade-in Cauldrons can spawn any items from the [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}]] or [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|Legendary}}]] pool. 3 [[Items#Common|{{Color|common|Common}}]] items are required to trade up to an {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} item, and 5 {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} items are required to trade up to a {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} item. Cauldrons will prioritize Scrap when trading, see {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, White}} for details on Scrap trading behavior.

{{Clear}}

==Lunar Seer==
[[File:Lunar Seer.png|frameless|right|128px|Lunar Seer]]
The Lunar Seer consists of two pedestals that each respectively display an image of a forthcoming [[Environments|Environment]]. By interacting with one of them, at the cost of {{LunarCoin|3}}, the player is able to select which environment will appear next. Note that it is also possible to see both variants for either {{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}} or {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}} at the same time because they are considered unique environments. After [[Environments#Looping|looping]] both pre-loop and post-loop environment variants can appear. Furthermore, while {{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Treeborn Colony}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Golden Dieback}} can normally be accessed only via a [[Halcyon Shrine#Green Portal|Green Portal]], they can also appear here. {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} on the other hand cannot.

The selected environment will only be guaranteed if the Blue Portal is used to exit the Bazaar. Travelling to the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} through the Null Portal located under the Bazaar will cancel any purchase made at the seer, causing the stage following the Void Fields to be selected at random.

===Environment Overrides===
For each pedestal there’s a chance that it will be replaced by a specific environment. This chance is variable and dependent on conditions. It starts with a base value of 0% for any of the following conditions it is incremented accordingly.

{| class="wikitable" style="display:inline-block;margin-right:10px"
!Chance 
!Environment
!Condition
|-
|5%
| Gilded Coast 
|No condition
|-
| 5%
|Void Locus 
|[[Survivors of the Void]], no [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|eclipse]], at least 4 stages cleared
|-
|10%
|Gilded Coast 
|[[Seekers of the Storm]], {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} not defeated yet
|}

For each condition met its destination is put in a weighted list and is selected from for the replacement. For example, with all conditions met, there is a 20% chance that each pedestal will be replaced and within that there is a 75% chance that Gilded Coast will be selected. However, if the replacement environment for the second pedestal has already been selected for the first one, the second one will be skipped.

{{Clear}}

==Survivor Suspended In Time==
[[File:Survivor Suspended In Time.png|frameless|right|128px|Survivor Suspended In Time]]
The survivor {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} is locked in a crystal near Newt. Paying {{LunarCoin|10}} will unlock her, completing [[Pause.]] This crystal only appears if at least one player in the lobby has not unlocked the character. Because of this the crystal does not appear during a [[Alternate Game Modes#Prismatic Trials|Prismatic Trial]] as all unlockables are considered unlocked.

{{Clear}}

==Null Portal==
The Null Portal is a type of Portal that teleports the player to the [[Void Fields]], a [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realm]] where the player can go through 9 waves of enemies to gain rewards. It is accessed only once per run through the Bazaar Between Time, below the Blue Portal which the player enters and exits. Dropping below the platform and into a green, misty cave in the wall will reveal a purple and black portal surrounded by dead {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}}. As mentioned previously, the portal can only be entered once per run; going to the spot where the portal was after being used only shows the empty cavern.

==Logbook Entry==
[[File:Bazaar Between Time - Environment Log.jpg|thumb|Environment Log location]]
The Environmental Log can be found between two support arcs far below the Blue Portal platform and can be accessed by jumping down the rift and landing on the support arcs. It is at the same level as the path leading to the Null Portal.

Unlike most other environment logs, it will not disappear 5 minutes after entering the level.

==Trivia==
*The language files contain some unused entries relating to the Bazaar and the Newt.
**In the Interactors.txt language file, there is an unused interactor listed as &lt;code&gt;"BAZAAR_UPGRADE_LUNAR_NAME" : Slab&lt;/code&gt;, which according to the file would allow you to "Permanently upgrade Item Shop". It is unclear what this means, although there is another unused interactor with a similar property called &lt;code&gt;"BAZAAR_UPGRADE_DRONE_NAME" : Slab&lt;/code&gt;, which allows you to "Permanently upgrade Drone Shop".
**In the Messages.txt file, there are entries that suggest the Newt was once planned to talk to the player.
***When upgrading ("NEWT_UPGRADE"):
****"Yes yes. That will grow both ways. Both ways."
****"More growth. Good good good."
****"Good growth. Will grow both ways. Both!"

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

Upon pickup, they offer no benefits or detriments to the player beyond giving them an extra item. However, when the player enters the Celestial Portal to enter [[A Moment, Fractured]] and obliterates themself at the [[A Moment, Fractured#Obelisk|Obelisk]], they will be transported to [[A Moment, Whole]] before ending the run. This secret area contains one of the four {{EntityLink|Twisted Scavenger|Twisted Scavengers}}, each of which have their own preset list of items and equipment unlike regular {{EntityLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}}.

Stacking the Beads beyond the first pickup has no additional effect.

Unlockable with the challenge [[True Respite]] by Oblitering youself at the Obelisk on [[A Moment, Fractured]].

== Notes ==
* Since most Lunar items have an effect that is severely detrimental to the player, the Beads of Fealty provide players with an item to convert with a [[Cleansing Pool]] without risk.

* Dying to the {{EntityLink|Twisted Scavenger}} after obliterating will not grant mastery skins.

* {{PAGENAME}} cannot be obtained in either the [[Eclipse]] or [[Simulacrum]] game modes, as A Moment, Fractured is inaccessible in both.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] introduced in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Beetle}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
Beetles spawn by digging out of the ground, usually in numbers due to being the cheapest enemy [[Directors#Categories|Directors]] can spawn. They hop around aimlessly until spotting a player.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 20% of the Beetle's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Headbutt ===
The Beetle winds up for 0.5 seconds to headbutt a target within 2m. This deals 200% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and moves the Beetle slightly forwards. 

This attack has no cooldown, but has a total animation duration of 1.5 seconds which scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].
===Secondary: Sleep ===
&lt;span data-darkreader-inline-color="" style="color:#FF69B4"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt; This content is not functioning within the game.

This is a leftover from development, in which monsters were intended to have states that would make them look like they were in the middle of an action before the Survivors showed up. This was scrapped due to the pace of the game being too high and the time available being too low.&lt;ref&gt;(&lt;nowiki&gt;https://discord.com/channels/562704639141740588/567832879879553037/844393228798787604&lt;/nowiki&gt; ROR2Modding Discord) ''DestroyedClone — 05/18/2021'' &lt;blockquote&gt;ghor was their sleep state planned for anything their m2&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Ghor — 05/18/2021'' &lt;blockquote&gt;yeah. the idea was that sometimes you'd discover monsters in "act busy" states that made it seem like they were in the middle of something before you showed up&lt;/blockquote&gt;(&lt;nowiki&gt;https://discord.com/channels/562704639141740588/567832879879553037/844393337863274507&lt;/nowiki&gt;) ''Ghor — 05/18/2021'' &lt;blockquote&gt;pace of the game turned out to be too high and time available too low&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to use the skill will freeze the Beetle, preventing any further input. Regardless, the skill has a cooldown of 1 second.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary off nodegraph''': the Beetle must be within 2m from its target. The Beetle will not rely on node points to get closer to the target as it will be close enough to chase directly.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Beetle must be within 10m from its target and have line of sight. The Beetle will not rely on node points to get closer to the target as it will be close enough to chase directly.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. Similar to the chase behavior of any other monster, the Beetle will go from node point to node point in an attempt to close in on its target. As a result, it may look like walking in a zig-zag pattern, depending on where the next node might be.

== Tips ==
* The Beetle is by far the least threatening enemy the [[Survivors]] will face on the planet. While its headbutt can deal respectable damage, its range is extremely short, and can be dodged by simply jumping above the Beetle. Beetles should be considered the lowest priority when fighting groups of enemies.
* Alternatively, the player may consider Beetles an easy way to activate powerful on-kill effects, such as {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}, {{ItemLink|Ceremonial Dagger}}, and {{ItemLink|Resonance Disc}} to deal large amounts of area damage.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a gorilla-like insect [[Monsters|monster]] introduced in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Beetle}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Beetle Guard's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Ground Slam ===
The Beetle Guard raises both its arms into the air before slamming them down, causing spikes to erupt from the ground around it, primarily in front. This skill deals 440% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and launches any targets in the air with a force of 1500. This attack has an animation duration of 2.7 seconds.

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds.
=== Secondary: Sunder ===
The Beetle Guard smashes the ground with its right arm, causing a line of spikes to appear from the ground that continuously travel at 40m/s for 1.5s, dealing 300% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. Any target hit by the spikes is knocked towards the Beetle Guard with a force of -2500. This attack lasts for 2.05 seconds, but scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]. 

The hitbox is at the front of the spike wave and any spikes left lingering behind are purely for a visual effect without doing any damage. The hitbox has a height of 5.95m and a single jump cannot clear it, therefore players are advised to move out of its way. &lt;!-- What is the height of the spikes? --&gt; 

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds, and the Beetle Guard can store two charges of this skill. 

This attack can be blocked by {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}}.

=== Utility: Defense Up ===
&lt;span style="color:#FF69B4"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt; This content is not functioning within the game.

The Beetle Guard never uses this skill. It puts both arms onto the ground, pushing itself up and shivering, then gains a temporary buff (EnrageAncientWisp) for 8 seconds, causing shields to appear circling it. This does not actually grant the Beetle Guard any [[Health#Shield|shield]] or [[armor]], but gives 40% additional [[Movement Speed|speed]]. 

This skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Beetle Guard must be within 10m from its target. The Beetle Guard will also move directly towards the player, ignoring any node graph points.
# '''Return to leader (far)''': the Beetle Guard must have a leader and be more than 100m away from it. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds.
# '''Strafe while waiting for primary''': the Beetle Guard must be within 10m from its target. It will also ignore any node points when deciding for its movement destination.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Beetle Guard must be within 10-25m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Use secondary''': the Beetle Guard must be within 10-40m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will be active for 3.5 seconds. This means that if the Beetle Guard have both charges ready, it will fire them one after another. Otherwise, it will stay stationary for 3.5, even if it has enough attack speed to finish the attack much earlier.
# '''Chase''': no requirements, as long as its target is still alive.
# '''Return to leader (default)''': the Beetle Guard must be at least 15m away from its leader. Unlike the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Solus Probe}}, it will not attempt to find a new target. However, if the player gets near its field of vision, or attacks it, it will retaliate. This behavior have the result where if the Beetle Guard kills its current target and does not instantly find another one, it will go back to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Queen}} and stay idle.

== Notes ==

* The Beetle Guard's turning animation does not necessarily accurately represent its actual direction. This can lead to situations where it casts Sunder behind it, while it visually looks in a different direction.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] introduced in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Beetle}} monster family. Being a Boss, the Beetle Queen may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. She can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Acid Shot ===
The Queen readies the attack for 2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and then shoots 6 acid balls that spread out in a 30° arc. Each ball travels at 50m/s and upon impact with the terrain it explodes in radius of 6m and [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear]] damage falloff. Upon exploding, each ball also leaves behind a lingering pool of acid that continuously damage players standing in them. Both the acid balls and pools can be deleted by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

Each ball deals 130% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0, whereas the lingering acid pools have a proc coefficient of 0.1, tick for 26% damage every 0.5s, and last for 15 seconds.

The skill has 3 charges, has a cooldown of 10 seconds, and has an end lag of 2 seconds (scales with attack speed).

=== Secondary: Beetlejuice Spawn ===
The Queen launches flying beetles that home in to all nearby players. These beetles deal no damage, but inflict the stacking{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BeetleJuice}} debuff in a 5m sphere around them, once per second. The debuff lasts 2 seconds, but all stacks are refreshed when a new stack is applied. Players with beetle juice on them have their movement speed, attack speed, and damage reduced by 5% per stack of beetle juice.

These beetles have 80 health and can be destroyed, activating any [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill effects]] the player has. They will naturally expire after 20 seconds.

This skill has a cooldown of 20 seconds and an animation duration of 6 seconds (scales with attack speed).

=== Special: Summon Beetles ===
The Queen spawns 2 {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards}}. If she is an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]], these Guards will be the same Elite type as her. The summoned Beetle Guards do not drop any [[gold]] or experience when killed.

This skill has a cooldown of 28 seconds and an animation duration of 9 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special''': the Queen must be within 10-130m from its target.
# '''Use secondary''': the Queen must be within 80m from its target and have less than 75% health.
# '''Use primary''': the Queen must be within 80m from its target and have line of sight. The Queen will spend at least 2 seconds in this behavior, even if it has sufficient attack speed to execute it faster.
# '''Chase''': the Queen must be at least 20m away from its target. Given the long range of all of the Queen's skills, it is extremely likely they will be used the moment any of them come off cooldown. Due to their long animations and number of charges, the Queen will effectively rotate them almost constantly and will therefore mostly chase the player if they are more than 130 meters away.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}''

If the Beetle Queen is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Beetle Queen) to be replaced by her {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}.

== Tips ==
* The Beetle Queen is most deadly at close range. Her only directly damaging attack, Acid Shot, serves as a shotgun-style attack and can inflict incredible damage if the player is hit by multiple acid balls at once. Try to keep a safe distance whenever possible.
* Make use of area-of-effect attacks and items, as the Queen's summoned Beetle Guards can quickly gang up on the player if not dealt with.
* If the player cannot kill the summoned Beetle Guards quickly enough between respawns, the best course of action is to focus on the Beetle Queen and then clean up the Guards afterwards.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

If the holder has any stacks of this item, most debuffs they would receive are completely negated. When this happens, a visual effect of a raincoat will be briefly displayed over the [[Survivors|Survivor]] and the item will go on a 5 second internal cooldown, represented by the {{StatusEffectLink|ImmuneToDebuffConsumed}} debuff. Negating a debuff also gives the holder 10% [[Health#Barrier|barrier]]. After the cooldown is over, the buff will be replaced with the {{StatusEffectLink|ImmuneToDebuff}} buff, indicating debuffs can be negated again.

The holder can negate 1 (''+1 per stack'') debuff before Ben's Raincoat goes on cooldown.

== Notes == 

*{{PAGENAME}} only negates '''timed''' [[Status Effects#Debuffs|Debuffs]].
**{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Permanent Curse}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Permanent Armor Reduction}} are not negated because they do not expire.
**{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=VoidFog}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=VoidFogStrong}} are also not negated because they are technically not debuffs. Even if they were to be blocked, it would not prevent the damage which is caused by a controller. ''(See [[Void Fog]] for more details on this mechanic)''
**The {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic|Spinel Tonic's}} {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction|Tonic Afflictions}} are also not prevented, since they are items and not a debuff.
** Unlike the {{ItemLink|Blast Shower}}, {{PAGENAME}} does not prevent cooldown debuffs, such as {{StatusEffectLink|ElementalRingsCooldown}} and {{StatusEffectLink|BearVoidCooldown}}.

**🌧 No longer blocks non-timed debuffs, like Eclipse 8 and skills like Power Mode &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Ben’s Raincoat was a very binary item, resulting in unsatisfying stacking behavior and frustrations when given to monsters (like in Simulacrum). The item also trivialized Eclipse 8. Now, it has a bit of downtime for when it can block debuffs - and since we didn’t want this to be just a net nerf, we also added a large barrier when blocking a debuff with the coat.''

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}. 

At the start of each stage, the item selects 3 (''+3 per stack'') random Common or {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} items in the holder's inventory. Each ''stack'' of a selected item randomly transforms into an equal-sized stack of a random item of the next higher rarity (for example, a stack of 4 {{ItemLink|Mocha}} would transform into 4 of a random green item). 

== Notes ==
* [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|Legendary}}]], [[Items#Boss|{{Color|boss|boss}}]], [[Items#Void|{{Color|void|void}}]], [[Items#Lunar|{{Color|lunar|lunar}}]], and {{Color|untiered|untiered}} items (such as {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction}}, {{ItemLink|Empty Bottle}}, etc) ''cannot'' be transformed.
* The items are chosen at random regardless of rarity, stacks, or pick-up history. The items in the transformation rarity are shuffled and if the selected item belongs in any of the Damage, Healing, or Utility categories, the items in the transformation rarity are ordered to include those first. For example, {{ItemLink|itemName=Mocha}} will prioritise any {{Color|Uncommon}} Damage/Utility items to transform into.
** This means if the selected item is either White Scrap or {{Color|Uncommon|Green Scrap}}, no items will be prioritised for the transformation.
*{{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} is ''not'' excluded from being upgraded into, meaning the Benthic Bloom will inevitably start to duplicate itself at an increasing rate.
* It's possible for the Benthic Bloom to select the same item twice. This means that an item can go straight from Common to Legendary in a single stage.
** Additionally, identical items are consolidated into a single stack even in the middle of the Bloom's transformation sequence. This means a stack of a Common item can be upgraded twice if it combines with a stack of an Uncommon item the player already has. For example, if the player has 1 {{ItemLink|Mocha}}, 1 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}, and 1 {{ItemLink|Shuriken}}, it is possible for the Benthic Bloom to first upgrade the Mocha and Soldier's Syringe into 2 Shurikens (for a total stack of 3 Shurikens). After this, it is possible that the third and final upgrade will turn the Shurikens into 3 {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}. While this is an improbable scenario, it is not impossible.
== Tips ==
* Obtaining a Benthic Bloom in the first few stages of a run can lead to a massive boost in power by giving the player more Uncommon and Legendary items than normal by the end of the first loop, with the tradeoff of not having as many stacks of Common items.
* On the other hand, since the Benthic Bloom transforms full stacks of the chosen items, obtaining it very late in a looping run may cause more trouble than it is worth. Suddenly losing all stacks of offensive items such as {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} or {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} can drastically reduce damage output, losing healing &amp; utility items such as {{ItemLink|Leeching Seed}} or {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} can make it much harder to survive, and because no legendary items grant movement speed, this can be a big issue if {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}}, {{ItemLink|Energy Drink}}, or {{ItemLink|Wax Quail}} are lost. 
* Because void items cannot be transformed, corrupting items can keep them "safe" from being lost, albeit with a different effect.

== Trivia ==
* In keeping with the deep-sea theming of the Void, the term "benthic" refers to the very bottom of a body of water; in the context of this item, it can be surmised that the Benthic Bloom originates from the deepest recesses of the Void.
** This may also be why the Benthic Bloom is the corruption of a legendary item, to reflect its scarcity and difficulty to obtain due to the depth of the Void it originates from.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder kills 4 enemies in quick succession, they get the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=WarCryBuff|altText=War Cry}} buff for 6 seconds (''+4 seconds per stack''), which grants a 50% increase in movement speed and a 100% increase in attack speed. 

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} All 4 enemies do not have to be killed within 1 second. The Pauldron activates when the player's multikill streak reaches 4 or more, and the streak only resets if 1 second passes without killing an enemy. 

== Tips ==
* Characters with powerful crowd control abilities such as {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}, {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, and {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} can make much more reliable use of this item.
* Items that deal powerful area damage, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Ukulele}}, can make activating this item's effect easier.
* Although the {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} activates on-kill effects, it alone cannot activate the Berzerker's Pauldron. The doll registers a "kill" once per second, which is too slow to maintain a multikill streak on its own. It will still make activating the Pauldron easier, however.
** Having a {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell}} makes it possible to have 2 dolls active at once, which is sufficient to activate the Berzerker's Pauldron.
* The War Cry buff does ''not'' stack with the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TeamWarCry}} buff from {{ItemLink|itemName=Gorag's Opus}}. In fact, the two buffs cannot coexist, so whichever is activated later can overwrite the other. This is important if one has at least a few stacks for a long duration for Berzerker's Pauldron but activates the Gorag's Opus, which will bring down the duration to just 7 seconds.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Bighorn Bison|returning]] bison-like [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Bison's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Headbutt ===
The Bison will headbutt the target for 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. The duration of this attack is 2.5 seconds, which scales with [[Damage#Attack speed|attack speed]].

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds. 
=== Utility: Charge ===
The Bison prepares to charge for 1.5 seconds (scales with attack speed), which is indicated by a cowbell sound and the Bison scraping its hooves against the ground and lowering its head. It then charges for 4 seconds, dealing 300% damage to any target it hits (but only once per target). It will attempt to adjust its movement direction towards the target, but its turning speed means it will move along a wide circle. This means if the player moves out of the way of the charge, the Bison will continue circling the target with no chance of homing in for an impact. If during the charge the Bison collides with a solid surface instead, the charge will end prematurely and the Bison will be stunned for 3 seconds. Despite charging, this state does not count as sprinting, however, the Bison's movement speed is multiplied by a factor of 8. 

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds and a proc coefficient of 1.0.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Bison must be within 7m from its target and looking at it. However, this means that if the player is standing behind the Bison, or to its side, the Bison could be looking at the player, but the attack will still be executed forward and miss. Due to the cooldown of the move, the player can take advantage of this by always strafing to the Bison's back to render it completely useless and effectively stuck in place.
# '''Use utility''': the Bison must be within 7-60m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* The Bighorn Bison's turning radius when charging is rather wide, so it can be avoided rather easily with a speedy sidestep. It can be dodged even more easily with anything that allows higher jumping, such as a{{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather}} or {{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

The item grants the player a flat +25 maximum HP ''(+25 HP per stack).''

== Notes ==
* The Bison Steak synergizes well with {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}}, as it improves the health increase. A Transcendence will provide the player a flat +38 maximum HP (+25 maximum HP plus 50% of 25) instead of a flat 25 maximum health.

* {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} will halve the flat 25 maximum HP increase for every stack of Shaped Glass the player has, as it does scale with maximum health as well. A Bison Steak will provide less and less maximum HP increase the more stacks of Shaped Glass the player has.
* If one manages to acquire a large sum of [[Pearl]]s then the Bison Steak will add more health.
* With the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}, it will grant only 2.5 health and visually round up your HP.

== Trivia ==
* When Fresh Meat was first added, it increased base health regeneration by +2hp/s for 3s (+3s per stack) after killing an enemy.
* The effect of the Fresh Meat that the Bison Steak replaced is similar to the [[Ror:Meat Nugget|Meat Nugget]] from Risk of Rain 1, which has a chance to drop healing meat nuggets when damaging an enemy.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''. It is completed by defeating {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} in the [[Gilded Coast]] stage before the Halcyon Beacons deactivate.

==Tips==
*{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} makes this challenge easier, since his {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield|survivorName=Engineer}} can block Aurelionite's laser entirely, avoiding the time loss caused by needing to take cover.
* Lowering the difficulty and going to the [[Gilded Coast]] quickly helps considerably. As Aurelionite is a [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Boss]], her health increases much faster than most other enemy types as time goes on. Waiting too long before entering the Gilded Coast makes this challenge much more difficult.
* The  [[Trophy Hunter's Tricorn]] trivializes this challenge, as once Aurelionite is able to be damaged, you can use the Tricorn and one shot her, thus completing the challenge.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] added in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''.

When activated, it removes any and all [[Status Effects#Debuffs|negative status effects]] from the user. This includes, but is not limited to, the frozen effect from {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixWhite}} [[Monsters#Glacial|Elite]] explosions, the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=burn}} from {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixRed}} [[Monsters#Blazing|Elites]], the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} applied by explosive pots and {{MonsterLink|Clay Templar|Clay Templars}}, and even the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HealingDisabled|altText=heal block}} applied by {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} [[Monsters#Malachite|Elites]].

The Blast Shower also destroys all projectiles within a 6m radius around the player. Removing incoming projectiles is very difficult, but it reliably clears bombs attached to the player by {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} [[Monsters#Overloading|Elite]] attacks.

== Notes ==
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction|altText=Tonic Afflictions}} ''cannot'' be removed with the Blast Shower, as they are stored in the player's inventory and are not actually a status effect.

* The acid pools left behind by {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen|Beetle Queens}}, the fire fields from {{MonsterLink|Mini Mushrum|Mini Mushrums}}, and Malachite spike pits are all technically projectiles and as such can be removed by the Blast Shower if the player is standing on them.

* Counterintuitively, the Null Safe Zone barrier effect of the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} is considered a debuff and is removed, though it is instantly reapplied while inside an active vent. This only results in the player's screen changing color very briefly. This is no longer possible as of the [[Survivors of the Void Update]], due to the Null Safe Zone effect being replaced with {{StatusEffectLink|VoidFog}}.

* The Blast Shower only cleanses ''timed'' debuffs and thus does ''not'' cleanse {{StatusEffectLink|PermanentDebuff}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PermanentCurse}} (from {{EntityLink|Eclipse8|Eclipse 8|altUrl=Eclipse#Eclipse 8}}).

* The Blast Shower does ''not'' reset the out-of-combat timer. This means that the regeneration from {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}, shields (including from {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}, {{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue}} and {{StatusEffectLink|AffixLunar}}), and the {{ItemLink|Oddly-shaped Opal}} armor buff will not be regenerated when the Blast Shower is used.

== Tips ==
* The 10 second cooldown of {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} and {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} is tracked using the stacking {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElementalRingsCooldown}} buff, and when all stacks are removed the Bands are {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElementalRingsReady|altText=ready}}. This means that activating the Blast Shower instantly recharges the Bands, making it surprisingly powerful when combined with a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}}, {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|Fuel Cells}} and/or a {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst}}. 
** 20 Gestures will reduce the Blast Shower's cooldown to less than 0.5s, which is lower than the minimum cooldown of all skills. Cooldown recovery beyond this will only be beneficial when using items that can activate the Bands, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}.
** The cooldown buffs {{StatusEffectLink|ElementalRingVoidCooldown}} and {{StatusEffectLink|BearVoidCooldown}} function similarly. Continually resetting the cooldown for {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}} removes the need for stacking the item and allows for higher uptime on damage blocking, to the point of near-invulnerability if enough {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned|altText=Gestures}} are stacked.
* Similarly, the Blast Shower recharges {{ItemLink|Ben's Raincoat}}. Although it might seem the items' effects are overlapping and redundant, the Blast Shower can be useful to negate debuffs received while the Raincoat is on cooldown, and to bring its protection back again to defend against more.
* The Beetle' Queen's flying beetles repeatedly inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BeetleJuice}} on players nearby, and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Grandparent|altText=Grandparent's}} solar flare attack continuously inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=Burn}} and{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overheat}} in a large area. When suffering from these debuffs, the player should make sure to move out of these attacks' areas of effect ''before'' using the Blast Shower, or else the debuffs will be immediately reapplied and waste the equipment's charge.
** The Blast Shower is similarly unhelpful for removing the{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}} inflicted by the [[Commencement#Releasing the Rescue Ship|Pillar of Design's]] repeated shockwaves.
*There are several telegraphed attacks that can be cleansed with Blast Shower's ability to destroy projectiles such as the pools caused by [[Lunar Chimera (Exploder)]] and [[Beetle Queen]], the ground attacks of [[Solus Control Unit]], [[Alloy Worship Unit]], [[Stone Titan]], and [[Clay Apothecary]], and the rotating attack used by phase 3 [[Mithrix]]
**In order to properly cleanse these attacks, it is important to stand at the center of the attack, making the pools caused by [[Lunar Chimera (Exploder)]] and [[Beetle Queen]] less practical to cleanse.
***Following this logic, it is possible to cleanse the entire rotating attack used by phase 3 [[Mithrix]] with only 4 fuel cells by standing at the intersection of all the pillars and activating Blast Shower's effect whenever the pillar's appear.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a flying [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

==Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Blind Pests spawn by swooping down from above, and flap through the air haphazardly. 

===Primary: Spit===
The Blind Pest spits a fast-moving glob of acid moving at 100m/s, which deals 200% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coeffcient]] of 1.0, and can travel up to 500m. While the attack is executed 0.35s after activation, the attack lasts for 2 seconds. Both of these timings scale with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second which does not start until the attack has finished. 

=== Behaviors ===
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Blind Pest must be within 70m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase while waiting for primary''': the Blind Pest must be within 50m from its target and have line of sight. This means the Blind Pest will continuously keep getting closer to its target while spitting acid every 3 seconds. If the Pest gets too close to the ground, or on top of its target, it will land closing its wings. In this state it will walk and even attempt its attack from melee range. However, it will rarely stay on the ground for long and will take flight again.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

==Notes==
*Blind Pests' fur color changes based on the stage; on Siphoned Forest and Rallypoint Delta, their fur is completely white.
*Despite Blind Pests not relying on sight, they will not attack invisible characters.

== Tips==
*Although they have low health and their attacks are easily avoided by constantly moving, Blind Pests can be surprisingly dangerous. They become more difficult to dodge in groups or when other enemies are present, their damage scales quickly, and they generally keep a fair distance from the player, so it may be hard to kill them reliably.
*Blind Pests behave similarly to{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lesser Wisp|altText=Lesser Wisps}}, but are considerably more dangerous. Pests' sound cues when attacking are less obvious than Wisps', their stats scale much faster, and they fly much further out of reach.
*Blazing Blind Pests in the early stages are easily the deadliest foe to attack players and should always be of the highest priority; getting hit can reduce a fragile survivor's HP to critical in just a single hit.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Trivia==
*The Blind Pest has a functional walking animation, which it rarely uses. Unlike {{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture|altText=Alloy Vultures}}, Blind Pests do ''not'' fall to the ground when stunned. They can, however, be grounded by {{Color|u|freezing}} them using {{SkillLink|Cast Nano-Spear|Artificer}}, {{SkillLink|Snapfreeze|Artificer}}, or {{SkillLink|Cryocharge|Railgunner}}, or when pulled to the ground by  {{SkillLink|skillName=Spiked Fist}}. 
**If a target stands still for a period of time, the Blind Pest will gradually approach until it lands on top of the target. Any further attack or flight animations may give the appearance of the Pest "licking" the target, but this is not an actual programmed behavior.
*The snowy version of Blind Pests is actually an entirely separate monster and on release, had a significantly lower director cost than its standard variant due to an oversight.
*The name, appearance and logbook entry highly hints towards being of a similar species to {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Blind Vermin}}. Both creatures are given the prefix "Radkari" in their respective logs
**Despite this, they do not have a related [[Family Events|Family Event]], and vermin do not spawn in Sulphur Pools unlike pests. 

== Bugs ==
* Blind pests are not animated when viewed in the logbook
* [[Monsters#Overloading|Overloading]] blind pests' bomb will spawn on hit but will not attach to the target, meaning a moving target will likely not get hit by the explosion.
* The Blind Pest's attack does not count as a combat skill, so it will not cancel the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Whip Boost}} [[Status Effects#Buffs|buff]] granted by {{ItemLink|itemName=Red Whip}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

==Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 20% of the Blind Vermin's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: Blind Chomp===
The Blind Vermin lashes out with a quick, short-range bite that inflicts 150% damage to all targets within range with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. It lunges forward slightly when chomping.

This skill has no cooldown, but the attack lasts for 1 second and scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Strafe''': the Blind Vermin must be with 3m from its target. This behavior lasts for 0.2 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row. This is very likely a precursor to using the primary skill.
# '''Use primary and chase off nodegraph''': the Blind Vermin must be within 4m from its target. Despite its description, the skill is not necessary to be off cooldown, but it will be used if and when it is ready. This behavior is active for 0.2 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row. The Vermin will also attempt to get close to its target ignoring the node graph. This means at very close ranges the Blind Vermin will switch between strafing and chasing its target every 0.2 seconds while using the primary skill whenever available.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Blind Vermin must be within 7m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase (near)''': the Blind Vermin must be within 12m from its target. Despite its description, it will also attempt to use the primary attack if ready. A bite from from such a range is very likely to miss and is probably meant more to establish the idea that the monster does not rely on sight.
# '''Chase (medium)''': the Blind Vermin must be within 20m from its target. This behavior is active for 0.2 seconds.
# '''Chase''': no requirements as long as the Blind Vermin has a target.
# '''Go to ally:''' the Blind Vermin must have not spotted an enemy and be within 15m from an ally. This behavior is active for 0.2 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row. If it still has not acquired a target at the end of it, it will switch to its [[Enemy AI#Wander|Wander]] state. However, while wandering it is very likely it will spot the same ally, switch to the Combat state, and select this behavior again.

==Notes==
*Blind Vermins' fur changes color based on the stage; on Siphoned Forest and Rallypoint Delta, their fur is completely white.

== Tips ==
*Similar to their {{MonsterLink|Blind Pest|flying counterparts}}, Blind Vermin can prove themselves to be an incredibly dangerous enemy if left unchecked and allowed to fester, due to their high speed and unpredictable behavior compared to other melee enemies, such as {{MonsterLink|Beetle|Beetles}}.
*Due to their high movement compared to many other enemies, {{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed}} [[Monsters#Blazing|Elites]] may be more inconvenient to fight than usual. Since Blind Vermin cannot turn quickly but move forwards rapidly, the player may find themselves encircled in fire even if they successfully dodge the Vermin's attacks.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] added in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''. It is completed by killing 15 [[Monsters#Bosses|bosses]] in a single run.

Completing it will unlock the 4 [[Heretic|Heresy items]]: {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}, {{ItemLink|Hooks of Heresy}}, {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}, and {{ItemLink|Essence of Heresy}}, and by extension, the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}.

== Tips ==
* Both [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Bosses]] and bosses that spawn naturally in stages count towards this challenge.
* Each individual enemy in a Horde of Many (and each enemy spawned during the second phase of the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss}} fight) counts towards this challenge.
** This means that enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} can trivialize this challenge, as Teleporter Events (outside of the late game) will spawn Hordes of Many.
**Similarly, individual enemies on the Boss Waves of [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|The Simulacrum]] all count towards this challenge. This is potentially the quickest way to unlock this challenge if one has the Survivors of The Void DLC, as most boss waves will include more than 15 enemies.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

For each enemy and ally within 20 meters gain the {{StatusEffectLink|Bolstering Lantern Attack Speed}} buff which increases attack speed by 10% ''(+3.5% per stack)'' up to a maximum of 3 ''(+1 per stack)'' buff stacks. 

==Notes ==
*The Bolstering Lantern's area of effect is indicated by a blue-green ring on the ground around the holder.
*One stack of the item at its max potential is equivalent to having 2 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}. 
*Entities that have a health bar, such as the destructible pots in {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}, or the rocks in {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}, also grant the buff. However, engaging in combat in their vicinity will provide a benefit only transiently or with the added that risk that a stray shot can set off the explosives.

== Tips== 
*While this item will generally help with attack speed for any survivor, it is especially effective with survivors that are always in close range combat like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}}, as they will always be in close range of enemies and will have multiple stacks of this buff.
*{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} can make amazing use with this item with {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}} and {{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret}} as both the turrets and Engineer can benefit from the attack speed buff.
*[https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Interactables#Drones Drones] and items that give allies like {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}} can help you reach high attack speed with this item, as they will be relatively near you, especially when it combat with enemies.
*If the player can ensure they will not accumulate a lot of chip damage, it can be beneficial to allow weak enemies to swarm them, e.g., {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}}, while they prioritise fighting a boss.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
*Other Changes
**{{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern|Bolstering Lantern’s}} scaling is now more focused on the item's utility rather than increasing its effective range. It now grants 10% (+ 3.5% per stack) attack speed (up from a flat 7.5%). That effect is granted per Monster or Ally in a 20 meter range up to 3 (+ 1 per stack). The range no longer scales with additional Lanterns.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
*Item Changes
** Attack speed bonus of Bolstering Lantern has been reduced from 10% to 7.5% per enemy within 20 meters.
* Bug Fixes
**{{ItemLink|Eccentric Vase|Eccentric Vase’s}} Tunnel no longer collides with the visual indicator of {{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern}}.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.6]]
* Reworked Bolstering Lantern
** Old Functionality - When below 50% health, receive a damage increase of 20%
** New Functionality - Increase your attack speed by 10% for up to 4 (+2 per stack) enemies and allies within 20 (+5 per stack meters.)
----
;[[Patch v1.3.2]]
* Fixed an issue with Bolstering Lantern where the logbook ‘unlock’ highlighting no longer was clearing after viewing the unlock.
----
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
* Added New Item: Bolstering Lantern
}}

==Trivia== 
*The Bolstering Lantern's lore entry seems to imply that the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} was a joint effort by the {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians}} and {{MonsterLink|Grovetender|Grovetenders}}. Also, this is first lore entry that shows dialogue between [[monsters]].
*While the item and its related buff were reworked in [[Patch v1.3.6]], it was only in [[Patch v1.3.7]] when their internal names were updated to reflect their new functionalities. Before this the item used to be called LowerHealthHigherDamage.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by collecting 10 Monster or Environment Logs.

== Tips ==
* Monster Logs will drop randomly from their corresponding monster. This chance is affected by [[luck]].
* Environment Logs can be obtained in two different ways:
** by activating a [[Radio Scanner]] on common [[Environments]]. 
** by finding their hidden location and directly picking them up on [[Hidden Realms]].

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Early Access Patch (Build ID No.3703355)]]
* Bug Fixes
** Environment logs now count towards the 10 logs challenge.

When the holder activates their [[Items#Equipment|equipment]], they also activate 1 (''+1 per stack'') effect of another random equipment.

== Notes ==
* Certain equipment effects are blacklisted and cannot be called by the Bottled Chaos. These are the 4 lunar equipment ({{ItemLink|itemName=Glowing Meteorite}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Effigy of Grief}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}) as well as {{ItemLink|itemName=The Crowdfunder}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Milky Chrysalis}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Recycler}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Array}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Executive Card}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed)}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Seed of Life (Consumed)}}. The Bottled Chaos will still trigger when using these equipment, however.
**This brings the total possible equipment outcomes to 20, however the Bottled Chaos will never trigger the holder's equipment as a repeat unless they have 19+ stacks of this item (thus forcing the game to trigger all possible outcomes and loop back), bringing the chance for a single specific equipment (assuming the player is holding a non-blacklisted one) to trigger to 1/19 or 5.2%.
**Note that The Crowdfunder ''cannot'' trigger the Bottled Chaos, since it is not truly "activated" in the way other equipment are.
*Equipment that have special activation conditions will still activate the Bottled Chaos when those conditions are met; for instance, if the player has an Executive Card, the Bottled Chaos will trigger whenever the player buys something with [[gold]].
*The Bottled Chaos can call the {{ItemLink|Volcanic Egg}}, so exercise some caution when activating equipment, as the Volcanic Egg can greatly disrupt movement. Using the {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} makes this even more likely.
* When the Bottled Chaos activates, a shadowy outline of it briefly appears above the holder's head.
* When the Bottled Chaos activates, it gathers all acceptable equipment in a list, shuffles them and activates them in order. If an equipment fails to be activated, e.g., {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Goobo Jr.}} having reached the cap limit, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Royal Capacitor}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Eccentric Vase}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Remote Caffeinator}} not aiming at a valid target/surface, the activation will not be counted. Additionally, the user's current equipment is removed and added at the end of this list, so that its effect will not be among the first few ones.
** This means in order to have a duplicate random equipment activated, the activator must have enough stacks of the item to cycle through the whole list.
** Removing and adding the user's current equipment means that a blacklisted equipment can be activated if the user has enough stacks of this item. Most of these will either fail to activate or just refresh the current equipment's effect duration, for which no time has passed anyway.
*** Keep in mind the user cannot kill two lined up [[Monsters#Bosses|bosses]] with {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} because the equipment is instantly transformed into its consumed version before Bottled Chaos' effect is activated.

==Trivia==
*The "crystalline blade" mentioned in the item's lore is referring to the sword wielded by [[ror:Providence|Providence]].
**This suggests that void monsters had previously tried to invade [[Petrichor V]] but were driven away by Providence, explaining why no void enemies appeared in Risk of Rain 1. However, once Providence was killed, because {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} was trapped on the moon, the void monsters could begin their invasion of the planet.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder kills an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] enemy, all their skill cooldowns are {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=NoCooldowns|altText=temporarily reduced}} to the minimum of 0.5 seconds, for a duration of 4 seconds (''+4 seconds per stack'').

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of no cooldowns is incorrect, since skills have a minimum of 0.5 second cooldown.
* While the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=NoCooldowns}} buff is active, the screen is tinted pink.
* This item gets a near-permanent effect with the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} enabled.
* The {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} will ''never'' trigger the Brainstalks' effect, even if the{{ArtifactLink|Honor}} is enabled.
* Some skills can have their inputs held down for constant use of their skill during the buff, but others will require the input to be pressed again when they're off cooldown.

== Tips ==

* The Brainstalks become progessively more powerful late-game as more monsters spawn as Elites, essentially completely replacing the needs for {{ItemLink|Alien Head}}, {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}, or {{ItemLink|Purity}}.
* While near-instant cooldowns are appealing on paper, remember that the time it takes to use a skill is also limited by how that skill may prevent others from being used. For instance, other skills cannot be used while charging {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader|altText=Loader's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Gauntlet}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb}}. Other skills may lock the player into a scripted animation during which skills cannot be used, such as when {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}} spins his gun while firing {{SkillLink|skillName=Lights Out}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado}}, or when Artificer uses {{SkillLink|skillName=Flamethrower}}.

== Trivia ==
* The item is a brain with what look like brightly-colored cordyceps fungi sprouting out of it. The cordyceps are famous for their unique form of parasitism, growing inside and through an insect's head. Some cordyceps species even affect the insect's behavior.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a bell-like airborne [[Monsters|monster]] introduced in Risk of Rain 2.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
Brass Contraptions float steadily in the air and pursue targets slowly.

=== Primary: Spiked Multishot ===
The Brass Contraption's only attack is to summon 3 spiked balls above itself heralded by a clanging sound, which lasts 2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]). It hurls the balls at its target one after another over 3 seconds, which also scales with attack speed. Each spike ball travels at 80m/s and deals 500% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. The balls will disappear after 6 seconds from being launched, so if they have stuck in the ground, they will remain there cosmetically without dealing any damage if touched. 

{{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can block the balls, even when they are stuck in the ground. 

This skill has a 5 second cooldown.  

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary and flee''': the Brass Contraption must be within 25m from its target. The primary isn't necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Brass Contraption must be within 25-50m from its target. This behavior will be active for 1 second.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Notes ==

* The spike balls floating above the Brass Contraption while it prepares its attack are purely visual. When a projectile is launched, one of the spike balls above the Contraption is destroyed and the damaging projectile spawns in its place. This means that {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{ItemLink|itemName=Defensive Microbots}} will not immediately destroy the spike balls while the Contraption is preparing to attack.

== Tips ==
* It's recommended when fighting Brass Contraptions to always strafe around them clockwise. Since Brass Contraptions always fire the spike balls from their right to left, moving this way will make avoiding the last two shots easier.
* The Brass Contraption's spike balls travel quickly, are deadly accurate, and deal heavy damage. Players must remain vigilant to avoid being blindsided or struck from a long distance.
* Being stunned, frozen, or shocked only prevents a Brass Contraption from summoning new spike balls; if it already has prepared them when it is afflicted by the status, the spike balls will be launched regardless. {{Keyword|Frozen}}

== Trivia ==
* Brass Contraptions have several unused behaviors:
** The spike balls have unused behavior where they explode on impact with a radius of 6m, dealing 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 with sweet spot falloff. After exploding, the spike ball would spawn 4 tiny spike balls.
** There is a spike ball projectile named "bellDevice" which is larger and rounder, with similar properties to the spike ball that is currently used.
** There is an unused entity state for the Brass Contraption in which it would aim a beam at a nearby ally and grant them invincibility, which would wear off when the Brass Contraption died.
*In the game's credits, a sketch of a Brass Contraption shooting a laser from its bell appears. It is possible that this behavior was the original attack of the Brass Contraption and was changed later in development.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

Grounded enemies that are hit with any skill are launched in the air and stunned for 3.2 seconds. If enemies are hit while airborne, they are launched again up to 2 times (+1 per stack). Launched enemies will take 10% more damage per launch. The effect recharges after 15 seconds.

== Notes ==
* Unlike items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}} which boost each individual damage instance without modifying the strength of the incoming attack, Breaching Fin does modify the incoming damage which means for long proc chains its effect can double dip. For example, Commando doing 12 damage with his primary has it modified to &lt;math&gt;12 \times 1.1 = 13.2&lt;/math&gt;, which proccing a {{ItemLink|itemName=Charged Perforator}} does &lt;math&gt;13.2 \times 1.1 \times 5 = 72.6&lt;/math&gt;damage and that proccing a {{ItemLink|itemName=Sticky Bomb}} does &lt;math&gt;72.6 \times 1.1 \times 1.8 = 143.748&lt;/math&gt; damage.
** This also means hitting an enemy with a skill that does 200% damage but has been juggled 10 times would result to a 400% damage which can proc {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band|altText=}}{{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band|altText=bands}}. This is unlike the same hit [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically striking]] which also does 400% damage, but without modifying the incoming damage to that value.
* When the holder initially hits an enemy that is launched, they lose the {{StatusEffectLink|Knockback Available}} buff, which is what allows them to launch enemies into the air. However, for 0.75 seconds upon losing the buff, they are still able to launch any enemy they hit with skills.
** This allows skills with an area-of-effect to launch multiple enemies at the same time, e.g., {{SurvivorLink|Bandit|Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Smoke Bomb}}.
** Since {{ItemLink|itemName=Brilliant Behemoth}} inherits the attack type of the triggering hit, any enemy that you hit that procs the debuff will also apply to any other enemy that was hit by the explosion from Brilliant Behemoth.
* When the enemy is initially launched, they are inflicted with the {{StatusEffectLink|Knockback Hit}} debuff equal to the number of times they can be juggled in the air. Every time they are juggled this debuff is decreased by 1. The debuff is also completely removed if the enemy hits the ground.
* This item does not affect flyer enemies, with the exception of those that can be grounded, e.g. {{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture}} and {{MonsterLink|Blind Pest}}. Even if a flyer enemy is touching the ground due to the attacking pushing them into it, the item will still not be triggered for them.
*It is also necessary for ground enemies to be on the ground when attacked, e.g., a {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}} which is currently jumping cannot be launched.
**There are some ground enemies that have [[:Category:IgnoreKnockback Characters|immunity]] to this effect.
* Similar to other cooldown buffs, using {{ItemLink|Blast Shower}}  can reset {{StatusEffectLink|Knockback Unavailable}}.
*The amount of juggles required to make an enemy receive fall damage when they hit the ground depends on how high they are launched with each hit, which varies with their size. Furthermore, if an enemy is juggled while they're already falling, their vertical velocity will be reset.

==Tips==
*Juggling enemies is more effective if used with a high fire-rating skill, such as {{SkillLink|Suppressive Fire}}.
**Any items that increase [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]] also amplify its effectiveness.

**Base damage increase of {{ItemLink|Breaching Fin}} reduced to 10% (was 20%) however each additional juggle increases damage by 10% (with a single item the total bonus is 30% with a fully-juggled enemy, gaining further stacks of Breaching Fin gives you an extra juggle and a further +10% damage for each additional juggle.)

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Brilliant Behemoth|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

''All'' the holder's attacks (including bonus attacks from items) create 4m (''+2.5m per stack'') explosions that deal 60% [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]]. The radius of each explosion is multiplied by the attack's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]], so damage that has a proc coefficient of 0.0 (e.g. {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}}) will not explode. 

The explosion itself has a proc coefficient of 0.0.

== Notes ==
* {{color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of (''+1.5m per stack'') is incorrect.
* Unlike all other total damage items, the Brilliant Behemoth strangely inherits the attack type of the triggering hit. This means that the explosion can:
** Grant stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BanditSkull}} when killing enemies, if the triggering hit is {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|Desperado}}.
** Add an extra stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MercExpose}} when triggered by a hit that inflicts it.
** Deal additional damage from the {{Keyword|d|Slayer}} [[keyword]] if the triggering attack has that keyword.
** Instantly kill enemies using the {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}}, if the triggering attack succeeded the instant-kill roll.
*** Because the Behemoth will not check if the enemy is a boss when inheriting the instant-kill type, this means that bosses are ''not'' immune to being instantly killed by the Behemoth if the player instantly kills a non-boss enemy that is close by (as bosses are only "immune" because the Lost Seer's Lenses will not roll the chance to kill them). This does not work on either of the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=''}} {{MonsterLink|Voidling|altText=''}} [[Mithrix|final]] [[Voidling|bosses]], however, as they are immune to this damage type altogether.
* Attacks create explosions when damaging an [[Damage#On-Hit Anything|enemy or impacting a surface]], even if the projectile is not destroyed on contact with terrain. This means that {{SkillLink|skillName=Frag Grenade|survivorName=Commando|altText=Frag Grenades}} create explosions when bouncing off terrain, and the projectiles from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Ceremonial Dagger}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Egocentrism}} will constantly explode when piercing through terrain. 
** This also means that an attack that normally explodes, such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb}}, will create an additional explosion in the attack's center thanks to the Behemoth. However, any enemy damaged by the original explosion will ''also'' explode due to the Behemoth. If the enemy is close enough to the original explosion's center, it can take damage from the Behemoth twice: once from the explosion created by the attack's impact, and once from the explosion created when the attack damages it.
** The same exploding effect occurs with the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overloading}} exploding orbs.
* The explosion will usually damage the enemy that the attack was triggered on, making Brilliant Behemoth ''at worst'' a flat +60% multiplicative damage upgrade in addition to potentially hitting other enemies with the explosions.

== Trivia ==
* Due to how the Brilliant Behemoth inherits the triggering hit's attack type, it could theoretically inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SuperBleeding}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Poisoned}}, or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Blight}} when triggered by a corresponding skill. However, since the explosion's proc coefficient is 0.0, the debuffs have a duration of 0 seconds and are thus not inflicted at all.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The player has a 30% chance to gain [[gold]] equal to 8%(+8% per stack) of the Small Chest any time they hit an enemy, but they will ''surrender'' a percentage of their gold to any enemy that deals damage to them. The proportion of gold surrendered is equal to the proportion of maximum health lost (''+100% per stack''). Self-inflicted damage, such as from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}}, will subtract the holder's gold as any other damage would.

The chance to gain gold when damaging enemies is affected by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. The amount of gold gained is also affected by the [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]].
== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets are affected by the Brittle Crown, but they gain and lose gold independently from the player. Since the turrets cannot use gold in any way, this makes the Brittle Crown effectively useless for them.

* {{ItemLink|itemName=The Crowdfunder}} becomes self-sustaining with a Brittle Crown, as long as the player can continually hit enemies with it and avoid taking damage.

== Math ==
The formula for gold earned is: &lt;code&gt;C &amp;sdot; D &amp;sdot; 2&lt;/code&gt;

C = Number of Brittle Crowns

D = [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|Difficulty Coefficient]]
[[File:Plot brittle crown.png|none|thumb|500x500px|Graph of gold gained per stage, per proc (30% for 1 Brittle Crown). Assumes 1 player, completing 1 stage per 5 minutes. See [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|Difficulty Coefficient]] for underlying formula for 'D'.]]

=== [[Shrine of Blood]] ===
The Brittle Crown has a unique interaction with the Shrine of Blood. '''''This is no longer the case after''''' '''[[Survivors of the Void]]'', which changed the Brittle Crown's gold loss.'''''

* The amount of gold earned is not added to the total amount of gold when calculating gold lost.
** If the player has 100 health, 100 gold, and one Brittle Crown, using the Shrine of Blood for the first time will leave them with 75 gold.
*** Taking 50% damage, they lose 50% of their gold, leaving them with 50 gold. The shrine always gives 50% of the health taken as gold, so they then gain 25 gold.
* The Brittle Crown subtracts gold based on the player's fullCombinedHealth, which is their maximum HP plus their maximum shields. This is the same value that Shrines of Blood use, so as long as the player's fullCombinedHealth is more than two times their current gold, using a Shrine of Blood for the first time will net a profit.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Trivia ==
* The logbook entry for the Brittle Crown is written from {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=Mithrix's}} perspective and references the various species on {{EntityLink|Petrichor V}} and the tragedies that [[ror:Providence|Providence]], the main antagonist of the [[ror:|first Risk of Rain]], rescued them from.
** Intriguingly, this item and its logbook entry were added to the game ''before'' Mithrix was added as a boss.
*Since the [[gold]] reward for killing monsters is tied to their amount of gold they are currently holding, if a monster gets access to this item, the gold reward can increase or decrease based on how much they hit the player or get hit respectively. This is only possible when the player has any stacks of {{ItemLink|itemName=Eulogy Zero}} and it is a scenario where monsters can gain items for them to be converted to a Brittle Crown, i.e., {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, or [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} is blacklisted for monsters, but if it were possible to give it to them, they would reward the player with more gold than naturally expected.
**A {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}} spawning with {{ItemLink|itemName=The Crowdfunder}} is another way to have a monster's gold amount altered, albeit specific to that entity.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realm]] accessed by the Compound Generator in [[Sky Meadow]] or [[Helminth Hatchery]].

The area consists of block-shaped platforms, with the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}} in the center.

==Variants==
The [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion introduced 3 additional variants of Bulwark's Ambry, chosen randomly when the player enters the portal via the Compound Generator.

===Default===
Prior to Seekers of the Storm, this was the only variant of Bulwark's Ambry. It does not directly resemble any other stage. The arena consists of block stone architecture surrounding an open center where the Artifact Reliquary floats in the void. A small walkway is present to allow the player to approach the Reliquary. The Artifact Key necessary for beginning the trial sits a short distance in front of the Reliquary on a dark colored stone pedestal.

===Tar Research===
This variant features environment details reminiscent of {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}, most notably a large skeleton that winds throughout the multiple levels of this stage. Sets of stairs connect the different levels of this stage. The Artifact Reliquary sits in the center of this stage at it's middle floor, and the Artifact Key spawns on a two connected stone cubes directly in front of it.

===Aphelian Research===
This variant features environment details reminiscent of {{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}. Its winding structure can make it difficult to navigate, especially if the player has a significant amount of additional movement speed. The Artifact Reliquary sits in the center of the stage, and the Artifact Key sits directly in front of it on a stone pedestal. 

===Wisp Research===
This variant features environment details reminiscent of {{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}, including similar flags, trees, fences, and large gemstones. The floor of this stage is disconnected, consisting of floating stone plates between larger connected platforms. This can make traversal difficult if the player has too much or too little movement speed, and makes precise jumps important for navigation. The Artifact Reliquary sits on the upper level, surrounded by orange trees, and the Artifact Key sits a bit farther away, at the highest level on a large stone cube on the outermost reach of the stage.

==Artifact Portal==
[[File:Artifact Portal.jpg|thumb|The Artifact Portal created by the Compound Generator]]
The portal leading to Bulwark's Ambry can be generated on demand by the player using the [[Sky Meadow#Compound Generator|Compound Generator]] located on either the lower level of Sky Meadow or the uppermost level of Helminth Hatchery.

==Logbook Entry==
&lt;gallery class="nobackground" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;
Bulwark's Ambry - Environment Log.jpg|Default Variant Log location
Tar Research Log Location.jpg|Tar Research variant
Aphelian Research Log Location.jpg|Aphelian Research variant
Wisp Research Log Location.jpg|Wisp Research variant
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The location of the log for each variant is: 
*Default: on a little platform underneath the level (it can be seen during the cinematic intro of the stage).
*Tar Research: on the tip of one of the taller of the three large ring segments near the top of the map.
*Aphelian Research: on top of the column behind the ring on the opposite side of the tree.
*Wisp Research: by going down a path of 5 square "stepping stones" in a right angled formation.

The environment log will disappear 5 minutes after entering the level on every variant.

==Trivia ==
*Bulwark refers to [[ror:Providence|Providence]], the final boss of the first game and defender of the [[Petrichor V|Planet]] whose title was "Bulwark of the Weak", and an Ambry is a place where sacred objects are kept. This is confirmed by the logbook entry, which describes Providence creating the Artifacts in the Ambry.
*Each shape of the artifact code is heavily implied to refer to each element mentioned in Bulwark's Ambry's logbook.  
**The mass is the sphere, design is the cube, blood is the tetrahedron, and soul is the octahedron.
*Bulwark will sometimes glitch and gain additional health, requiring a 5th key to completely deplete its health.
*You can stand on the cubes that are seemingly part of the background.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Bundle of Fireworks|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When [[Interactibles|interacting]] with something (with the exception of [[Scrapper]]s), the player launches 8 ''(+4 per stack)'' homing fireworks, each exploding in a 5m radius and dealing 300% [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|damage]] with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2.  

== Notes ==

* After interacting with something, fireworks rockets are launched one by one every 0.1 seconds, firing directly upwards.
* Fireworks travel at 25m/s, and accelerate at 2m/s.
* Each fireworks rocket stops homing in on enemies after 8 seconds and will fall to the ground. If the rocket still has not hit anything after 16 seconds, it automatically explodes.
* Critical chance is rolled upon activation. If the chance succeeds, all fireworks from that instance will deal critical damage.
* The Bundle of Fireworks becomes substantially less useful with the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}}, since no [[Chests]] spawn.
* This item cannot be obtained in the [[Simulacrum]] mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}.
* Fireworks are affected by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Pocket I.C.B.M.}}. Instead of launching 3 times as many rockets over a longer period, 3 rockets are launched at once every 0.1 seconds instead of the normal 1.

== Tips ==
* The vending machine spawned by {{ItemLink|itemName=Remote Caffeinator}} allows for easy, repeated use of the Bundle of Fireworks and {{ItemLink|itemName=Squid Polyp}} while in [[Bosses|boss]] arenas or other areas which do not typically have [[interactables]].

== Lore ==

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update]]
* Major Content and Changes
** Added New Lore Entry: Firework
}}

== Trivia ==
* In the Risk of Rain universe, fireworks were banned on Earth after terrorists disguised missiles as fireworks. They were later re-legalized, in 2054.&lt;ref&gt;https://riskofrain.fandom.com/wiki/Bundle_of_Fireworks#Shipping_Details&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Bustling Fungus|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

After the holder remains stationary for 1 second, the item creates a radius of 3m ''(+1.5m per stack)'' which heals any ally within for 4.5% ''(2.25% per stack)'' health every second, as long as the holder remains still. 

== Notes ==
*{{Color|note|Correction:}} The radius starts at 3.5m instead of 3m.
*The fungus heals 4 times per second, for approximately 1.13% (+0.56%) health every tick.
*The fungus's healing scales with the max health of the ''recipient'', not the holder. It also can affect minions, such as [[Interactibles#Drones|drones]], {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, {{ItemLink|Squid Polyp|altText=Squid Turrets}}, and even ghosts from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}}. As a result, it can keep multiple turrets or ghosts alive despite their constant health drain and keep nearby minions healthy.

* Having 177 Bustling Fungus will reach more than 100% healing (100.125%) per tick, which is effectively a soft cap without items using overhealing such as {{ItemLink|Aegis}}. The {{ItemLink|itemName=Rejuvenation Rack}} will greatly reduce the number needed to hit this cap (87 with only one Rack).

* The effective healing radius is visible as a bright green circle around the holder, and green mushrooms of various sizes growing and disappearing. Any entity receiving healing inside the radius is also outlined in green.

== Tips ==
* The Bustling Fungus is extremely powerful to stack as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} (with his {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}}), due to his turrets' ability to inherit his item inventory and their immobility. Each turret will automatically create a healing radius, sustaining not just itself but Engineer as well.
**This strategy is particularly effective when combined with Engineer's {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield|survivorName=Engineer}}.
**By placing the sentries next to each other and having their healing circles overlap, their healing will be multiplied.
*{{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} is extremely powerful with this item, especially with the aforementioned Engineer strategy.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} can make excellent use of the Fungus while in {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}}, since the player's movement speed is already drastically reduced.
**The bonus healing also further augments MUL-T's survivability, on top of the large armor bonus from Power Mode.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} can rapidly fire {{SkillLink|skillName=Seed Barrage|survivorName=REX}} while remaining stationary using the Fungus, quickly regaining the health lost from using the skill.
* The Fungus's healing can easily offset the burning damage from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}}, especially if the damage is reduced with {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate|altText=Repulsion Armor Plates}}.
* The healing radius is placed at the holder's feet, or any ground straight below within 500m. 

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Trivia ==
* The Risk of Rain 2 community often refers to Bustling Fungus as "Bungus", a portmanteau of the two words. 
** The term gained such traction that the official Risk of Rain 2 Discord Server uses it for the Bustling Fungus emote.

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Anniversary Update]]
* Major Content
** Added New Lore Entry: {{PAGENAME}}
* Gameplay Changes
** Start Delay: 2s ⇒ 1s
** Now heals at a higher tick rate - overall healing is the same, but the healing is smoother over time
** 🌧 Now has small visual mushrooms that grow over the area

{{Skill|name=Oil Spill|cooldown=?|proc=?|type=Utility|notes=Oil Spill is CHEF's alternate utility ability. It is unlocked by completing the challenge "CHEF: You've always been crazy" which requires the player to hit 5 airborne enemies with 1 use of Roll. This can be done easily with primordial cube.
Oil spill launches the player in the air, and bounces them on the ground up to 4 times. Using this ability again just before hitting the ground will trigger 2 oil balls to fall from him, which can be ignited or frozen, depending on his secondary.}}}}

===Roll Thresholds===
''Each threshold is internally named as a gear shift.'' 

* Gear Shift Explosion
** The explosion requires at least 0.1s of charge
** Each explosion deals 30% more damage than the previous gear shift explosion.
** The explosion has 1750 force and 1500 vertical bonus knockback force
** It has a proc coefficient of 1, slows on hit, can crit, and will never hit self.
** It has an explosion radius of 9m
** As the damage increases and explosion happens on gear shift, it will never deal its base damage coefficient of 0.5.
* Charge Damage Coefficient = 5 + 5 * 0.2 * Gear
* Speed Multiplier = 1 + 1 * 0.3 * Gear
* Knockback Force = 1500 + 1500 * 0.3 * Gear
* Base Duration = 2.5 + 0.3 * Gear

==Behaviors==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''
TODO

==Tips== 
*Sear appears to harm enemies directly in-front of CHEF's model, it does not follow the player's camera making it difficult to use on enemies whom are flying or while moving in a different direction than the enemy.
*CHEF's special skill {{SkillLink|Glaze}} when paired with {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} can be used multiple times however the animation has to be completed and the oil globs launched before recasting otherwise the animation will be restarted and a charge will be used.
*CHEF has 3 charges for {{SkillLink|Dice}} which recharge overtime similarly to {{SurvivorLink|Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Blast}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Burst}}
**Like Bandits primary, {{SkillLink|skillName=Dice}} recharge rate is scaled by attack speed. However, unlike Bandit's primary, it also can be affected by cooldown reduction.
*CHEF's cleaver for {{SkillLink|Dice}} does not cause any damage to enemies while the cleaver model spins upon hitting the environment or reaching its max range.
*CHEF's {{SkillLink|Dice}} and {{SkillLink|Sear}} can be used while using {{SkillLink|Roll}} to increase the amount of damage possible.
*{{SkillLink|Roll}} gains armor while it is charging and has pulses which appear from the player indicating the level of charge and releases once reaching the 3rd charge level.
* {{SkillLink|Roll}} has similar active duration and speed with each level, the damage increases with each level as does the stun duration for enemies.
*All skills when hitting an enemy will cause a icon appear above the enemies health bar indicating which abilities they have been hit by making it easier to create more healing drops from {{SkillLink|CHEF's Kiss}}
* Using {{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} instantly resets {{SkillLink|Roll|altText=Roll's}} cooldown, which is useful for making quick escapes. A powerful hit &amp; run combo is {{SkillLink|Roll}} -&gt; {{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} on approach -&gt; boosted {{SkillLink|Dice}} -&gt; {{SkillLink|Roll}} to escape.
*{{ItemLink|Light Flux Pauldron}} seems like a very strong option for CHEF because its cooldown reduction and attack speed reduction cancel out for {{SkillLink|Dice}}. But the negative impact of attack speed reduction also causes the end of {{SkillLink|Sear}} to extend leaving the player unable to use any skills, {{SkillLink|Roll}} has a slower charge-up speed, and there is a delay before {{SkillLink|Glaze}} fires any projectiles. 
**{{ItemLink|Purity}} is the next best option. It is risky to run, as CHEF's pitiful proc coefficients on his primary and secondary already make it difficult to use proc items, and {{ItemLink|Purity}} only makes it worse. However, the cooldown reduction may prove useful for players leaning into more aggressive and "in-your-face" builds, similar to {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}.

==Lore==
{{Lore}}

==Bugs== 
* Using {{SkillLink|Dice}} during {{SkillLink|Roll}} causes {{SkillLink|CHEF's Kiss}} triggers for both abilities on hit enemies, even when they are not directly hit by {{SkillLink|Roll}}. This is useful for generating lots of healing food.
*Using {{SkillLink|Sear}} during {{SkillLink|Roll}} causes {{SkillLink|CHEF's Kiss}} triggers for only {{SkillLink|Roll}}, even for enemies that are only hit by {{SkillLink|Sear}}.
*If '''CHEF''' uses a skill boosted by {{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} and then gains the {{StatusEffectLink|DisableAllSkills}} debuff, "Yes, CHEF" will replace the special slot. Casting it again will make your non-special slots available, but they remain as the Unavailable skill.
**If the {{StatusEffectLink|DisableAllSkills}} debuff is cleared while CHEF is boosted, he can cast {{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} again, but {{StatusEffectLink|Boosted}} will not stack further.

CHEF - PRES-10.png|[[File:PRES-10.png|32px]] PRES-10
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Gallery==
* When CHEF impacts an enemy using Roll, an impact effect occurs.

&lt;/gallery&gt;



==Trivia== 
*CHEF's alternate special {{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} is based on his special "Second Helping" from the first game.
*CHEF is the 9th returning survivor and the only survivor to return in DLC.
**Comparably, Risk of Rain's Sniper only returns as {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} Mastery Skin in appearance.
*CHEF's boosted {{SkillLink|Dice}} has a value for a boosted damage coefficient, but it's effectively unused as in-game it uses the same value as the normal damage coefficient.


==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
*CHEF
**Added alternate abilities {{SkillLink|Ice Box}} and {{SkillLink|Oil Spill}} including {{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} Variants &amp; Unlock [[Challenges]].
**Updated character name from Chef to CHEF.
**Primary ({{SkillLink|Dice}}) changes:
***Changed behavior to have 3 stocks and for projectiles to auto-return if the attack button is not held.
***Single Dice cleaver damage reduced to 200% (Overall damage increased due to ability stocks.)
***Cleavers held out will now cause increased continuous damage to enemies that come into contact with them, and will do double damage when returning to CHEF.
**Removed {{SkillLink|Sear|altText=Sear's}} animation delay and and shortened its activation time while maintaining the same amount of damage.
**Boosted Dice now does 400% damage.
**Boosted Sear projectiles create pre-ignited oil pools when colliding with the ground.
**Boosted Roll now adds more bleed on hit.
**Covering enemies in oil now counts towards CHEF's passive
**Updated {{SkillLink|Roll}} to charge significantly faster.
**Jumping out of Roll now provides a super jump to CHEF.
**Range of Sear has been significantly increased and is much easier to aim.
**{{SkillLink|Glaze}} (and the new ability Oil Spill) leave patches of Flammable (and freezable!) Oil on the ground.
**Sear’s cooldown has been slightly increased from 5 seconds to 6 seconds.
**Roll’s cooldown has been slightly reduced from 9 seconds to 8 seconds.
**Glaze’s cooldown has been increased from 10 seconds to 12 seconds.
**{{SkillLink|Yes, CHEF!}} has had its cooldown reduced from 15 seconds to 10 seconds.
*Bug Fixes
**Players who have completed the “CHEF’s Wok” recipe but never received the [[Order Up!]] achievement (and were therefore unable to unlock CHEF) will now be able to complete the achievement.&lt;br&gt;'''''Developer note:''''' If you are a player that completed the CHEF’s Wok’s recipe but never received Chef’s “Order Up” achievement, then just booting the game after this update and reaching the main menu should grant you the achievement. If you are an Xbox user and don’t get the achievement upon reaching the main menu when unlocking CHEF moving forward, this might be related to missing save data. The solution for this is just to start a run with any survivor and that should grant the “Order Up” achievement". We are going to continue looking out for any save related issues so keep the reports coming.
**When playing as CHEF in multiplayer, other players will no longer see or hear you charge Boosted Roll after the ability should have ended.
**CHEF’s {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}} clones are now considered mechanical and are thus immune to {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|altText=Void Infestors}} (but now benefit from {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}}!)

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a challenge in Risk of Rain 2, added in the Seekers of the Storm expansion. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|CHEF}} by killing 10 {{MonsterLink|Bighorn Bison}} hitting a {{MonsterLink|Bighorn Bison}} with the default {{SkillLink|Glaze}} ability, then killing it with the ability {{SkillLink|Sear}} and collecting the subsequently dropped food item.

==Tips==
*It is advised to use the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} to double the amount of Bison spawned.
*Increasing your damage too much could make the completion of the challenge harder due to the Bison dying before being finished with "Sear".
*The "Oiled" debuff needs to be present on the Bison when you kill it with the "Sear" ability, otherwise no progress will be awarded.
*Bighorn Bison Elites count towards the achievements completion as well.
*This challenge is cumulative across all runs. It ''does not'' have to be completed within a single run.

*CHEF is not required to inflict all Burn stacks on its own, or any at all. All that needs to happen is for CHEF to land an attack while Mithrix is burning from at least 20 Burn stacks. This means in multiplayer an {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} teammate can assist with {{SkillLink|Flamethrower}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=CHEF}} by hitting five airborne enemies with one instance of {{SkillLink|Roll}}.

== Tips ==
*The description of hitting all 5 enemies with one instance of Roll is inaccurate. The tracked number of hit enemies is reset when the player touches the ground after a jump. It is therefore possible to use {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}} or a sufficiently large number of {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather|Hopoo Feathers}} to stay in the air between uses of the skill as well as having more direct control of approaching enemies while airborne.
**Landing on large airborne enemies, e.g., {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}}, counts as landing on a surface which resets the tracker.
*{{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} can help by grouping up flyer enemies. This can also work for ground enemies as long as they are pulled up in the air.

The '''Captain''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

Commander of the [[UES Safe Travels|UES ''Safe Travels'']], the Captain's strength is his ability to call down a variety of tactical drops from orbit, from a humble healing beacon to the spectacularly cataclysmic OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike.  

Completing the [[Washed Away]] challenge will unlock Captain as a playable survivor.

* Unlocked via the [[Captain: Worth Every Penny]] Challenge. ''({{ChallengeDesc|Captain: Worth Every Penny}})''
* Purchasables are hacked starting with the closest. This includes the nearest segment of a [[Chests#Multishop Terminal|Multishop Terminal]] or [[Chests#Equipment Triple Shop|Equipment Triple Shop]].
* Upon hacking: [[Chests]] will be opened, [[Interactables#Drones|Drones]] will be immediately bought, [[Shrine of Chance|Shrines of Chance]] will be activated once and cost {{Color|u|$0}} for all remaining attempts, [[Altar of Gold|Altars of Gold]] will be automatically activated, and [[Shrine of the Woods|Shrines of the Woods]] will have the first level bought, with subsequent levels costing {{Color|u|$0}}.
* Takes a longer time to hack items that are more expensive. Large Chests take longer than Chests, and Legendary Chests take much longer.
* Does not activate interactables that are locked by the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] (but it will still reduce their cost to {{Color|u|$0}}), or interactables that cost any currency other than [[gold]], such as [[Lunar Coins]].
}}}}

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use secondary (Power Tazer) and strafe''': Captain must be within 14m from the target and have line of sight. This is explicit to Captain's secondary skill and will never {{SkillLink|skillName=Slicing Maelstrom}}.
# '''Use primary (Orbital Probe) and stop''': the primary is used in the context of placing the target for the orbital strike. However, this behavior is only selectable when Orbital Probe is the selected utility skill. As such, Captain will never order a Diablo strike. This behavior is active for 0.2 seconds. At the end of this, the '''Strafe''' behavior takes precedence.
# '''Use utility (Orbital Probe) and stop''': Captain must have line of sight to the target. This behavior is only selectable when Captain is equipped with the Orbital Probe. As such, he will never use his utility skill with OGM-72 'Diablo' Strike or {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}}.
# '''Use primary (Vulcan Shotgun)''': Captain must be within 18m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 0.1 seconds and Captain will sprint.
# '''Use primary and chase''': Captain must be within 6m from the target. Since this behavior is not explicit about which primary skill is used, this is the only time Captain can be observed using {{SkillLink|skillName=Hungering Gaze}}. Internally, the name of the behavior is "BackUpIfClose", which implies the intention of using the primary while fleeing, but the behavior is in fact set to chase the target.
# '''Use primary from long range (Vulcan Shotgun)''': Captain must be within 60m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. The behavior is active for 2 seconds, during which the shotgun will be charged. Captain will also stand still for the duration. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. The behavior is active for 3 seconds.
# '''Strafe''': no requirements. The behavior is active for 0.5 seconds. This  is not naturally selectable and can only be chained after marking the orbital strike location.

==Tips==

*{{Color|captain|Captain}} has useful support skills and hard-hitting abilities, but lacks mobility. Plan items accordingly.

* {{Color|captain|Captain's}} {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}} make him very effective against {{MonsterLink|Lemurian|Lemurians}}, {{MonsterLink|Greater Wisp|Greater Wisps}}, {{MonsterLink|Blind Pest|Blind Pests}}, and other monsters that use projectiles. However, he cannot defend against {{MonsterLink|Clay Templar|Clay Templars}}, {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|Lunar Chimera Wisps}}, {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisps}}, {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golems}}, or the laser from {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|Stone Titans}}.

* {{Color|captain|Captain}} provides Defensive Microbots to the Strike Drones summoned by {{ItemLink|The Back-up}}.
**If {{Color|captain|Captain}} gives The Back-up to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}}, both the Equipment Drone and the Strike Drones it summons will get Defensive Microbots.

*Since {{Color|captain|Vulcan Shotgun}} fires 8 projectiles at once, and each projectile has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.75, {{color|captain|Captain}} can make very good use of items such as {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}, {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}}, and {{ItemLink|Shattering Justice}}.

*While aiming the {{Color|captain|Orbital Probe}}, picking up ammo boxes dropped by the {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} will restore 1 charge, allowing the player to use more than 3 per activation. However, the player cannot have more than 3 charges stored.

*Sprinting after activating {{Color|captain|Orbital Supply Beacon}} allows the player to exit targeting mode, and sprinting while aiming {{Color|captain|Orbital Probe}} puts it on full cooldown even if there are charges left.

*{{Color|captain|Orbital Supply Beacons}} can be used to activate the pressure plates on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]].

*{{Color|captain|Power Tazer}} or {{Color|captain|Beacon: Shocking}} can immobilize one or many enemies at once, allowing {{Color|captain|Orbital Probe}} and {{Color|captain|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}} to strike enemies more accurately.
**{{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} can also be used to keep enemies in place for accurate orbital strikes.

*{{Color|captain|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}} can benefit from {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}}, as long as enemies are above 90% health.
**Because of OGM-72 ‘DIABLO’ Strike’s long cooldown, Captain can benefit from items that enable him to use his skills more often such as {{ItemLink|Bandolier}}

*{{color|captain|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}} can be used to launch the player incredibly far into the air, at the cost of 90% of their health. To do this, stand in the center of the impact zone and do not move. Stay above 90% health in order to maintain [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]]. The Strike can be used:
**To skip the pillar sequence and go straight to the arena at the top of [[Commencement]]; the player should position themself and the impact on top of the roof of the Pillar of Soul island, closest to the arena.
**To reach several different [[Newt Altars]] in elevated positions.
*** ⚠ Note that {{color|captain|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}} is capable of applying on-hit effects to the player depending on the items held, such as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Fracture}} from [[Needletick]], and can result in an additional instance of damage after the initial hit - thus killing the player.

*In [[Hidden Realms]], {{Color|captain|Orbital Probe}}, {{color|captain|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}}, and {{Color|captain|Orbital Supply Beacon}} are unusable, indicated by an unplugged power cord icon and the description "You have lost connection with the UES Safe Travels..." Be sure to plan accordingly in such areas.
**Despite being "orbital" call-ins, all these abilities function normally in enclosed/roofed-in areas.

*{{Color|captain|Beacon: Hacking}} will use free purchases granted by {{ItemLink|Longstanding Solitude}} if the player has any.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} by killing the last phase of {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|the final boss}} by dropping an {{SkillLink|Orbital Supply Beacon|Captain}} on him.

Completing it unlocks the {{SkillLink|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|Captain}} in Captain's loadout.

== Tips ==
* When Mithrix drops below 90% of max health, he starts using his Lunar Orbs attack which keeps him in place for a short period of time, making it easier to line up the shot.
** Since this attack also deals 8% of his current health back to Mithrix (this is non-lethal), waiting for Mithrix to lower his health enough to be one-shot makes this a safe approach without risking any proc items accidentally killing him.

* Avoid collecting items that activate damaging effects that are beyond the player's control. This encompasses most random on-hit effects that deal damage, such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}.
** This also extends to offensive [[drones]] and other summoned allies as well.

* Certain [[Artifacts]] can greatly help:
** The {{ArtifactLink|Command}} allows the player to exclusively stack items that affect the damage of the Beacon itself, like {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}}.
***Since the final boss returns stolen items in the order the player obtained them, the player should pick up these items early in a run to ensure they can retrieve them without killing the boss.
** The {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} halves the final boss's health and spawns two copies of him. If something goes awry when attempting to smush the first, the second can be used as a backup.
** The {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} greatly increases the player's damage. However, it also makes survival considerably more difficult.
***{{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} can give the player a lesser damage boost without making survival as difficult as the Artifact of Glass.

* Coordinating with an {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|Snapfreeze|Artificer}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Cast Nano-Spear|survivorName=Artificer}} or a {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner|altText=Railgunner's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Cryocharge}} can freeze the final boss in place, making lining up the shot easier and affording the players some breathing room.
**Keep in mind that Captain will ''not'' complete this challenge if the final boss is killed by the execution threshold from being frozen.
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Chronobauble}}/{{ItemLink|itemName=Tentabauble}} and{{ItemLink|Effigy of Grief}} can be used to drastically slow the boss, making it less likely he will move out of the way of the beacon. As an added bonus, the Effigy of Grief also reduces his [[armor]].
**In a similar vein, consider coordinating with a {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} player, as {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Inject}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Weak}}. In addition to reducing the boss's attack strength, it further reduces his movement speed and armor.

}}

==Trivia==
*This challenge may have been inspired by Deep Rock Galactic, a similar horde-shooter sci-fi game where it is possible to kill large enemies by dropping Resupply Pods on them.
*It is technically possible to defeat {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|displayIcon=true}} in one hit. If a player were to time an {{SkillLink|skillName=Orbital Supply Beacon|survivorName=Captain|displayIcon=true}} to land on the first frame of Phase 4 before items are stolen and dealt&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Bigl(20(12+2.4(playerLevel))\Bigr)\Bigl(.2(Armor Piercing Rounds)\Bigr)\geq1400 +420(difficulty Level)&lt;/math&gt;damage, it would kill the boss instantly. This formula does not account for more than one player.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} by visiting 10 unique [[Environments]] in a single run.

== Notes ==
* All standard Environments and [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]] count towards this challenge.
** The environments must all be unique from each other. [[Environments#Looping|Looping]] and entering an environment that was previously visited in the run will ''not'' count towards the challenge.
** The internal list of visited stages is updated on scene change, which occurs when traveling to the next stage through a portal or [[Teleporter]]. For example, taking a [[Bazaar Between Time#Blue Portal|Blue Portal]] after completing a stage will mark the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}} as visited during the scene transition. Because of this, the first stage at the start of a run is ''not'' counted, since the scene has not changed to it. Visiting that same stage again by looping will properly add it to the list of visited stages.
** The end credits sequence counts as a unique scene for this challenge. This means that the player only needs to have changed scenes 8 times prior to {{EntityLink|entityName=Commencement}}, as Commencement will be scene 9 and the credits will be scene 10.

[[File:Tc280.png|thumb|400x400px|The TC-280 Prototype, prior to being repaired.]]
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by repairing a {{EntityLink|TC-280 Prototype}} in {{EntityLink|entityName=Rallypoint Delta}} as  {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}.

Completing it unlocks {{SkillLink|skillName=Beacon: Hacking|survivorName=Captain}} in Captain's loadout.

== Tips ==
* TC-280 Prototypes can ''only spawn'' on Rallypoint Delta. Additionally, they are relatively uncommon, so the player will likely need to revisit Rallypoint Delta several times.
** Rallypoint Delta can be selected as the upcoming stage by visiting the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}} during Stage 2 and using the [[Bazaar Between Time#Lunar Seer|Lunar Seer]], at the cost of [[Lunar Coins]].
** Enabling {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} increases the chance of the TC-280 drone spawning, as chests are no longer a factor.
* The TC-280 Prototype is ''extremely'' expensive, costing almost as much [[gold]] as a [[Chests#Legendary Chest|legendary chest]].
**[[Shrine of Blood|Shrines of Blood]] are a risky but lucrative method of quickly obtaining gold.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Ghor's Tome}} can net the player a decent amount of money. One gold nugget will cover 1/14th of the TC-280's cost.
**If the player is skilled at dodging, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Brittle Crown}} can generate gold quickly as the player battles enemies.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

After the holder avoids damage for 7 seconds, their health regeneration is increased by 3 HP per second (''+3 HP/s per stack'') until they take damage again. Additionally, this regeneration increases by 0.6 HP/s (''+0.6 HP/s per stack'') per player level. 

== Notes ==
* The extra heal is treated as passive regeneration, so the Cautious Slug does not inhibit completing the [[Naturopath]] challenge.
** This also means that this item is unaffected by the {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}.
* The Cautious Slug is very effective on the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}}, as two stacks can negate her negative regeneration entirely as long as the player avoids damage (which is made easier thanks to her {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} skill).

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Ceremonial Dagger|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When the holder kills an enemy, whether from a direct attack or one of their items, 3 spectral daggers appear where that enemy died. Each dagger deals 150% base damage (''+150% per stack''). They aggressively home in on other enemies within 130m, traveling at high speeds toward the nearest target. If the daggers have no targets, they slowly float downwards in midair and disappear after 10 seconds if no target comes within range.

Each dagger has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Notes ==
* The summoned daggers cannot travel through terrain but also make no attempt to avoid it. If there is any geometry between a dagger and its target (especially flat geometry such as walls), the dagger will likely get stuck as it tries relentlessly to get through.
* Each dagger [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically strikes]] independently of the others, and their critical strike chance is whatever the player's chance was when the daggers were summoned.

== Tips ==
* The {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} creates daggers when activated, giving an easy way for players to create daggers on demand even when there are no enemies nearby.
* Like other [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill items]], the Ceremonial Dagger pairs excellently with the {{ItemLink|Crowbar}}. The Ceremonial Dagger in particular excels with Crowbars, however, due to its long-range homing nature. Even just a few Crowbars can power up a single dagger to kill an enemy in one shot, thereby creating even more daggers. This can escalate to the point that killing just one enemy can create an avalanche of daggers that wipes out many enemies across the entire map.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update]]
* Gameplay Changes
** ☂ Update AI to be more accurate and performant
** Dagger Damage: 150% ⇒ 150% (+150% per stack)
** Dagger Number: 3 daggers (+3 per stack) ⇒ 3 daggers
}}

== Trivia ==
* The survivors speaking in the logbook entry are also mentioned in {{EntityLink|entityName=Wetland Aspect|altText=Wetland Aspect's}} environment log.
* Although Ceremonial Daggers are now AI-blacklisted, this was not always the case. After all, it would seem there would be no harm in giving enemies an item that only activates when killing a player. However, a {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavenger's}} Thqwib attack activates all the Scavenger's on-kill effects, so even a single use of this skill would spawn dozens of powerful homing daggers that would wipe out players in an instant.

The '''Chance Doll''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

The item adds a 40% ''(+10% per stack)'' chance to drop higher rarity items from a [[Shrine of Chance]] on a successful purchase.

==Notes==
*A successful roll does not upgrade the rarity of the drop, but rather it uses a custom item pool which has higher chances of selecting higher rarities. See [[#Math|Math]] for more details.
**At 7 stacks it guarantees the custom item pool will always be used. This pool never selects common items or {{Color|Equipment|equipment}}.
*Allows {{Color|Boss|boss}} items to drop from the Shrine.

==Math==
The Shrine of Chance has failure rate of 45% and the other 55% of the time it will drop an item. If the player has any Chance Doll stacks, it will roll for substituting the item pool with a success rate

&lt;math&gt;p = 30% + 10% \times amount&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''amount'' is the number of stacks.

The Shrine uses two item pools with different rarity weights based on whether the above roll succeeds.

*'''Default''': 65.57%, {{Color|Uncommon|16.39%}}, {{Color|Legendary|1.64%}}, {{Color|Boss|0%}}, {{Color|Equipment|16.39%}}
*'''Chance Doll''': 0%, {{Color|Uncommon|79%}}, {{Color|Legendary|20%}}, {{Color|Boss|1%}}, {{Color|Equipment|0%}}

The chance for selecting an item from a certain rarity is then calculated as

&lt;math&gt;((1-p) \times defaultRarityChance + p \times dollRarityChance) \times 55%&lt;/math&gt;

This data is summarised in the table below.

The '''Charged Perforator''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}. 

When the holder damages an enemy, there is a 10% chance that lightning will strike that enemy, dealing 500% (''+500% per stack'') [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]].

The lightning strike has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} This item does total damage, meaning it deals 500% of the damage of the hit that triggered it, not 500% base damage.
* The lightning strike is almost identical to that of the {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}, in which they both have a delayed strike that can be avoided by the target if said target is fast enough.
*Unlike all other total damage items, the Charged Perforator rolls its [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] chance independently of the triggering hit; the rest of the total damage items will land critical strikes if and only if the activating hit is a critical strike.

== Tips ==
* The Charged Perforator is especially effective for dealing with flying [[monsters]], since the lightning strike deals severe downward knockback. An airborne enemy struck by lightning will be pushed down at high speeds, suffering heavy damage when it collides with the ground.
** This is even more effective for monsters flying above bottomless pits, as they will be instantly killed when shoved downwards.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Anniversary Update]]
* Major Content
** Added New Boss Item: {{PAGENAME}}
** Added New Lore Entry: {{PAGENAME}}
}}

== Trivia ==
* This item's logbook entry is a word-for-word parody of the {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator|Molten Perforator's}}.
** The dance break at the end may be a play on the Charged Perforator itself, as it is the Molten Perforator 2: ''Electric'' Boogaloo.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are [[interactables]] that are randomly scattered throughout every [[Environments|Environment]] (excluding the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured}}, {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}}, the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}). Chests contain [[items]] that must be purchased with [[gold]].

== Small Chest ==
[[File:Small Chest.png|frameless|right|128px|Small Chest]]
The basic Chest variant. A Small Chest has a chance to contain either a [[Items#Common|{{Color|common|common}}]], [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]], or [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]] item.

Base cost: $25

Item chances:
* Common = 79.2%
* Uncommon = 19.8%
* Legendary = 0.99%

{{Clear}}
== Large Chest ==
[[File:Large Chest.png|frameless|right|128px|Large Chest]]
A Large Chest costs twice as much as a Small Chest and is rarer, but it contains an item of at least [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]] rarity and has a greatly increased chance to hold a [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]] item.

Base cost: $50

Item chances:
* Common = 0%
* Uncommon = 80%
* Legendary = 20%

{{Clear}}
== Legendary Chest ==
[[File:Legendary Chest.png|frameless|right|128px|Legendary Chest]]
A Legendary Chest is an expensive chest that costs 16 times as much as a Small Chest. However, it is guaranteed to hold a [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]] item. It can only be found starting from the 4th stage onward, and natural generation is extremely rare.

Base cost: $400

There is one guaranteed spawn location in {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}, nearby a small, yellow, glowing column, in a small cave full of foliage partially covered by a rock, ground-level, near the center of the map. It is also guaranteed to spawn in {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}, in one out of five different spots around the map, indicated by patches of small, glowing mushrooms.

{{Clear}}
== Equipment Barrel ==
[[File:Equipment Barrel.png|frameless|right|128px|Equipment Barrel]]
An Equipment Barrel costs as much as a Small Chest and always contains an [[Items#Equipment|{{Color|equipment|equipment}}]].

Base cost: $25

{{Clear}}
== Multishop Terminal ==
[[File:Multishop Terminal.png|frameless|right|128px|Multishop Terminal]]
A Multishop Terminal features a choice of three items to buy, costing the same as either a Small Chest or a Large Chest, depending on the rarity. They come in [[Items#Common|{{Color|common|common}}]] and [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]] variants. One item is always guaranteed visible, and the others have a 20% to be replaced by a question mark and hide their identity. After buying one item, the other items are locked and cannot be obtained from that Terminal anymore (unless the Survivor is carrying an {{ItemLink|Executive Card}}, in which case the other items will remain purchasable).

Base cost: $25 ([[Items#Common|{{Color|common|common}}]]), $50 ([[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]])

Multishop Terminals that spawn on {{EnvironmentLink|Wetland Aspect}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}} will sometimes sell [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]] items, while ones that spawn on {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} will always sell [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]] items.

{{Clear}}
== Equipment Triple Shop ==
[[File:Equipment Triple Shop.png|frameless|right|128px|Equipment Triple Shop]]
An Equipment Triple Shop costs twice as much as a Small Chest. It is similar to a Multishop Terminal, but sells [[Items#Equipment|{{Color|equipment|equipment}}]] instead.

Base cost: $50

Equipment Triple Shops can only appear on {{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Sulfur Pools}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}.

{{Clear}}
== Category Chest ==
[[File:Category Chests.png|frameless|right|128px|Category Chests]]
A Category Chest costs 20% more than a Small Chest and can come in three varieties: Damage, Healing, and Utility. Each Category Chest will only contain an item fitting its category. There is some overlap between categories, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Mocha}} being both a Damage and Utility item.

Base cost: $30

* [[:Category:Damage Items|Damage Chests]] are red, with a symbol of three bullets side-by-side emblazoned on top.
* [[:Category:Healing Items|Healing Chests]] are dark green, with a symbol of a white cross on top.
* [[:Category:Utility Items|Utility Chests]] are purple, with a symbol of what appears to be a "U" with a smaller circle inside it.

{{Clear}}
=={{SotV|noTooltip=true}}Large Category Chest==
[[File:Large Category Chests.png|right|frameless|159x159px]]
A Large Category Chest costs 20% more than a large Chest and can come in the same 3 varieties as its smaller variant: Damage, Healing, and Utility. Each Category Chest will only contain an item fitting its category, of at least [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]] rarity with a greatly increased chance to hold a [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]] item.

Base cost: $60

Large Damage Chests can only appear on {{EnvironmentLink|Siphoned Forest}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}.&lt;br&gt;
Large Healing Chests can only appear on {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Wetland Aspect}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Sulfur Pools}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}.&lt;br&gt;
Large Utility Chests can only appear on {{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}.

Item chances:
*Common = 0%
*Uncommon = 80%
*Legendary = 20%

{{Clear}}
==Adaptive Chest==
[[File:Adaptive Chest.png|frameless|right|128px|Adaptive Chest]]
An Adaptive Chest costs twice as much as a Small Chest. When interacted with, the center portion raises up to reveal a small compartment, which displays and cycles through items at an accelerating rate. Interacting with it again will drop the item currently shown in the cycle. If the player does not choose an item, the 30th one will be automatically dropped. Any regular item can appear in this cycle, including [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]] items and [[Items#Equipment|{{Color|equipment|equipment}}]], at around the same frequency as a Small Chest.

Base cost: $50

*Pausing the game in singleplayer will also pause the rotation of items in an Adaptive Chest. Therefore, the player can pause and unpause until they find their desired item and hold Interact upon unpausing again.

Item chances:

*Common = 63.06%
*Uncommon = 27.03%
*Legendary = 0.9%
*Equipment = 9.01%

==Rusty Lockbox==
[[File:Rusty Lockbox.png|frameless|right|128px|Rusty Lockbox]]
The Rusty Lockbox only spawns when a [[Survivors|Survivor]] holds the [[Items#Common|{{Color|common|common}}]] item {{ItemLink|Rusted Key}}. It does not cost gold to open, and will always contain an [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]] or [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]] item.

*At least one Survivor in the party must possess a Rusted Key for it to spawn (guaranteed spawn), but a key is required to open the Rusty Lockbox.
*Every stage, one Lockbox will spawn for each player holding a Rusted Key. The box cannot spawn in most Hidden Realms.
**Can spawn in the Hidden Realms {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}.
*It is easier to find a Rusty Lockbox while the [[Teleporter]] is being charged, because they become locked with orange tendrils like other interactables.
The item chances are the same as for a Large Chest.

=={{SotV|noTooltip=true}}Encrusted Cache==
[[File:Encrusted Cache.png|frameless|right|128px|Encrusted Cache]]
The Encrusted Cache only spawns when a [[Survivors|Survivor]] holds the [[Items#Void|{{Color|void|void}}]] item {{ItemLink|Encrusted Key}}. It does not cost gold to open, and will drop a [[Void Potential]] instead of a normal item.

*At least one Survivor in the party must possess an Encrusted Key for it to spawn (guaranteed spawn), but a key is required to open the Encrusted Cache.
*Every stage, one Encrusted Cache will spawn for each player holding an Encrusted Key. The cache cannot spawn in most Hidden Realms.

=={{SotV|noTooltip=true}}Crashed Multishop "Delivery"==
[[File:Crashed Multishop Delivery.png|frameless|right|128px|Crashed Multishop Delivery]]
The Crashed Multishop only spawns when a [[Survivors|Survivor]] holds the {{Color|uncommon|uncommon}} item {{ItemLink|itemName=Shipping Request Form}}. They act similarly to normal Multishops, but only have two options instead of three. It does not cost gold to open. One item will always be visible, while the other replaced with a question mark.

*At least one Survivor in the party must possess a Shipping Request Form for it to spawn (guaranteed spawn).
*Every stage, one Delivery will spawn for each player that holds any Shipping Request Forms. The delivery can also spawn in the Hidden Realms {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}.
*The rarity of the items are affected by how many stacks of Shipping Request Form the Survivor has at the start of the stage, much like how {{ItemLink|itemName=Rusted Key}} behaved before the [[Anniversary Update]].
*Similarly to a normal Multishop, carrying an {{ItemLink|Executive Card}} will allow both items to be collected.

==Cloaked Chest==
[[File:Cloaked Chest.png|frameless|right|128px|Cloaked Chest]]
A Cloaked Chest is an invisible chest that can be found in all Environments. Unlike other chests, this one does not have to be purchased. However, it is very difficult to see, being completely transparent, only slightly distorting the background.

*Cloaked Chests get locked while the [[Teleporter]] is charging, so try to spot them at this point.
*Keep an eye out for the "Open Cloaked Chest" prompt that appears when walking near the chest.
*Cloaked Chests can be scanned using the {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}}.
The item chances are the same as for a Small Chest.{{Clear}}
== Drop Chance Bias==
When a chest can drop an item from multiple rarities, in order for the game to choose the loot, it does not actually choose a rarity first and then an item within that rarity. Instead, it puts all available items in a weighted list, with each item of a rarity having the weight of the rarity category. This creates a bias towards rarities with more items. For example, for a Large Chest there are 30 {{Color|uncommon|uncommon}} and 26 {{Color|red|legendary}} available drops. This means the weighted list will have 56 items and the chances of getting an {{Color|uncommon|uncommon}} drop are &lt;math&gt;(.8 * 30) / (.8 * 30 + .2 * 26) = 82.1\%&lt;/math&gt;.

This behaviour affects all Chests (with the exception of the Crashed Multishop Delivery), [[Scavenger|Scavenger's Backpack]], [[Shrine of Chance|Shrines of Chance]], [[Void Cradle]]s, [[Void Potential]]s, the drops from the [[Artifacts#Sacrifice|Artifact of Sacrifice]], and the wave rewards in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].

In most cases the actual rarity chances do not differ very much from the expected values, because the number of items within the common, {{Color|uncommon}}, {{Color|legendary|legendary}}, and {{Color|orange|equipment}} categories are proportionally fairly similar. Exceptions to this include:

* The Small Healing Chest has (7/{{Color|uncommon|4}}/{{Color|red|4}}) available drops.
* Any Chest or Simulacrum wave reward with {{Color|void|void}} rarity, as there are (5/{{Color|uncommon|6}}/{{Color|red|2}}) available drops.
* Any Simulacrum wave reward that has {{Color|legendary|legendary}} and {{Color|yellow|boss}} drops competing.

**In the ''Anniversary'' Update, the visibility of Lockboxes was further improved by giving them a glow effect.
*Broken, worn out and rusted chests can be found in the {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}, possibly because the Survivor from Risk of Rain 1 had already been in that area and taken whatever items they held.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Child|returning]] [[Monsters|monster]], added in the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' expansion. 

While small and with a child-like attitude, as their name suggests, they pose a serious danger due to their agility and powerful attack.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior ==
===Passive: Teleport===
The Child can teleport under two conditions: 
* It has been falling for more than 0.65 seconds
*It has been hit by an attack for more than 0.1% of its max [[health]] and it has been at least 20 seconds since the last teleport

If it teleports away due to falling, it will teleport between 100m and 200m away, while if it teleports due to taking damage, it will only teleport between 25m and 37m away. This will put it in the ideal distance to use its primary attack, so players must instantly identify the Child's new position in order to evade the incoming attack.

In both cases the Child gains {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HiddenInvincibility}} for 1.5 seconds whenever it teleports.

This skill has a duration of 1.5 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and the actual teleportation occurs 0.2 seconds after the skill's execution. This means that in the unlikely scenario the Child has more than 7.5 attack speed, e.g., at least 44 {{ItemLink|itemName=Soldier's Syringe|altText=Soldier's Syringes}}, the skill will expire before the Child has a chance to teleport.

===Primary: Tracking Spark===
The Child raises its hands above its head and starts charging a spark ball, which it releases after 1 second (scales with attack). This ball slowly homes in on the player with a speed of 17m/s and upon impact, or after 4.3 seconds, it explodes dealing 600% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a 5m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot falloff]].

Unlike similarly tracking projectiles, such as from the {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}} and {{MonsterLink|Grovetender}}, this one cannot be destroyed by attacking it. However, it can still be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds.

===Secondary: Teleport===

This technically the passive teleport skill for taking damage, but it neither has any stocks nor can it replenish any, even though it has a cooldown of 20 seconds so it cannot be used directly. This skill is likely a leftover from a previous attempt in implementing the teleport as a skill, similar to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Parent}}.

===Behaviors===

#'''Use secondary''': there are no requirements for using this skill, but since it never has any stocks, it is never used.
#'''Run away sprinting''': the Child must be within 30m of its target and have line of sight.
#'''Stop and use primary''': the Child must be within 27m and 37m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior lasts for 2 seconds and it cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Strafe target''': the Child must be more than 35m away from its target. Most enemies run towards the target when far away, but the Child only strafes, therefore it is unlikely it will get within range to attack the player on its own. However, keep in mind that due to its passive skill, attacking it will cause it to teleport near the player and use its primary.

==Trivia==
*If the Child is attacked while it's charging its primary attack, it may attempt to run away without transitioning from its charging animation which will play on loop.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

Every time the player kills an enemy, they gain an {{StatusEffectLink|Increase Damage}} buff stack, which increases damage by 3.5% ''(+1% per stack)'' up to a maximum of 10 ''(+5 per stack)''. This buff lasts for 7 seconds and is refreshed every time the player kills or deals damage to any enemy.

== Notes== 
*The timer is refreshed every time an enemy is hit, not only when they are killed.
**The timer refresh requires a non-zero [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]], while a kill does not.
**The timer refresh also requires the attacked entity to not be on the player's team. While monsters are not expected to use this item effectively, this (most likely) unintended restriction makes the item inefficient for maintaining any kill count, e.g., from killing any [[Interactables#Drones|allies]].
*Once the kill timer expires, every single buff stack is removed at once. 
**3 seconds before expiring there will be a noticeable beeping sound, indicating the buff is about to end. It will stop once you either run out of time, kill an enemy, or hit an enemy with an attack.
*Once the holder has reached the maximum number of buff stacks allowed a sound is played.
*The item on the survivor's body has a digital display that updates whenever the player registers a kill.
**While this value tends to be in sync with the number of buff stacks obtained, the display can continue increasing beyond the buff's current cap limit, albeit with a yellowish color to indicate it's above the threshold.
***If the player then picks up another item stack, the buff stacks will not catch up to the new buff limit, but will still continue increasing with each new kill, maintaining the desync between the buff stacks and item display until this value is reset.
** {{Color|note|Bug:}} The digital display is supposed to only show kill values between 0 and 999, with the word "GOD" for anything beyond that. However, the code for this is flawed and it always displays a value with a preceeding 0, even for those exceeding three digits.
*{{Color|note|Bug:}} The damage from this item ignores any stat boost from {{ItemLink|Prayer Beads}} and is also not multiplied by the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}. See [[Damage#Inflicting Damage|how damage is calculated]] for more details.

==Math==
The following table summarises the damage boost for various buff/item stack scenarios.

==Tips== 
*The rocks on {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} can be a reliable area, albeit location-restricted, where one can rack up kills.
* This item encourages the player to focus on weaker enemies first to build up the damage boost as quickly as possible and then focus on bigger enemies, where continual combat engagement will maintain the accrued damage boost.
*Leaving a non-threatening monster alive in order to hit it occasionally can extend the kill timer when monsters don't spawn fast enough.
**Stationary enemies such as {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct}} and {{MonsterLink|Grandparent}} can also be used to that effect as long as the player can guarantee line of sight and sufficient attacking range to hit them on demand.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} has an exceptional synergy for this item, both for building up and maintaining the buff stacks.
**Combining this with a single stack of {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst}} allows the player to reactivate the equipment every 5 seconds, which in the absence of any monsters is sufficient to maintain the kill count indefinitely.
**{{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} both reduces the equipment's cooldown and takes away the burden of manually activating it. However, without an accompanying Soulbound Catalyst or some {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, there will still be a downtime in the equipment's cooldown during which the player will have to attack monsters in order to refresh the kill timer.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder damages an enemy, that enemy is {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow60|altText=slowed}} by 60% for 2 seconds ''(+2 seconds per stack)''. 

== Notes ==
* Unlike many other on-hit debuff effects, the Chronobauble is completely unaffected by the hit's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. The slowness debuff will always have the same duration when inflicted, regardless of the attack.
* Since this item only affects [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] and not [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]], this item's benefits are limited on enemies that use ranged attacks.
* The slow effect can be used to keep close-range enemies such as {{MonsterLink|Imp|Imps}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Blind Vermin}}, and even {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} at a distance
*Chronobauble is one of the most consistent debuffs to apply and as such it is very useful when trying to utilize {{ItemLink|Death Mark}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior ==
All of the Clay Apothecary's attacks inflict the {{StatusEffectLink|ClayGoo}} [[Debuffs|debuff]].

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Clay Apothecary's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: Tar Slam/Mortar (Face Slam)===
The Apothecary charges its fist for 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) before slamming the ground and emanating a blast which deals 150% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 15m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear falloff]]. At the same time it damages itself non-lethally for 5% of its max health. The self-damage has no proc coefficient. 

During the slam attack the Clay Apothecary also fires a mortar at the enemy it's targetting which is indicated by a red circle and a drizzle of tar from above. After 1.5 seconds the mortar lands and explodes, dealing 400% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 9m with sweet spot falloff. {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can block this projectile by deleting the red circle. 

This attack has a total duration of 2.46 seconds (scales with attack speed) including the initial charging up time. 

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds and can only be executed while on the ground. 

===Secondary: Tar Fling (Throw Barrel)===
The Apothecary prepares to throw a projetile for 1 second (scales with attack speed) before launching a shotgun-like spray of four tar balls from its top travelling at 50m/s and disappearing after 5 seconds. Each tar ball explodes on impact dealing 150% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with sweet spot falloff. This attack has an animation duration of 1.9 seconds in total, which scales with attack speed. 

Defensive Microbots can block the individual tar balls. 

This skill has a cooldown of 6 seconds, and the Clay Apothecary can store up to 3 charges. All charges are restocked when it is done recharging.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary (close)''': the Apothecary must be within 15m from its target. This is primarily used for the slam blast, but the mortar explosion can be another source of damage.
# '''Use primary (far)''': the Apothecary must be within 35-120m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 50% health. This is mostly used for the mortar.
# '''Use secondary''': the Apothecary must be within 15-65m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

==Notes==

*The mortar is actually a delayed explosion, not an actual mortar projectile launched upwards like the attacks from {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Hermit Crab|altText=Hermit Crabs}}.

== Tips==
* Clay Apothecaries are dangerous foes at any distance, but particularly close up; getting too near to them puts players at risk of taking damage from multiple Tar Fling balls at once. Apothecaries will also heavily punish players who try to get too close by shoving them back and Tarring them, putting them at medium range again and adding a movement penalty to boot.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] introduced in Risk of Rain 2. Being a Boss, the Clay Dunestrider may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Clay Pot Barrage ===
The lid on top of the Dunestrider's pot shakes for 4 seconds and then launches 11 clay pots at its target every 0.2 seconds with an additional end lag of 2 seconds at the end. All of these timings scale with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]. The clay pots travel at 50m/s and upon impact they explode in a radius of 5m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|no falloff]]. The clay pots can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

The pots aren't particularly accurate, adding 0.2 spread bloom with each shot. They each deal 100% damage and have a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. The skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.
This ability is actually a charged attack similar to {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}'s {{SkillLink|Bouncing Grenades}}, with the lid shaking as a cue to the charge, but the Dunestrider will always hold it until reaching the maximum amount of pots possible before firing.

=== Secondary: Rolling Tar Balls ===
The Clay Dunestrider extends its legs to raise itself up over 3 seconds, before dropping 3 balls of clay out from the bottom of its pot every 1 second. Both of these timings scale with attack speed. These balls roll across the floor with a velocity of 30m/s and home in on targets. Upon impact or after 10 seconds, they explode in a radius of 8m with linear damage falloff. This attack has an end lag of 3 seconds which scales with attack speed, during which the Dunestrider lowers itself again.

These balls can also be blocked by Defensive Microbots.

Each ball deals 200% damage and has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and inflict the{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} debuff. The skill has a cooldown of 20 seconds.

=== Special: Recover ===
The Clay Dunestrider plants itself into the ground and opens its lid. Tar tendrils will then latch onto all entities within a 50m radius - players and enemy monsters alike - and drag them towards the pot's center while slowly siphoning health from all affected entities. Once something is sucked close to the Dunestrider, the siphoning effect is amplified greatly. The tendrils will break if the latched entity dies or escapes more than 50m away from the Dunestrider. If all tendrils have been broken, or the Dunestrider has spent 15 seconds in this state, it will end the attack with an end lag of 1 second.

Each tether starts siphoning after 0.3 seconds upon latching onto an entity for 3.33% damage every 1/3rd of a second. This attack has a proc coefficient of 0.0 and cannot crit. The entity is dragged towards the center with a speed of 6m/s and if it is within 10 meters, each tick does 33.3% damage and ticks every 1/6th of a second.

The Dunestrider heals for 100% of the damage it deals, but since it can siphon from a large number of entities, the heal effect can be much stronger than the damage it deals to the player. In addition, it gains the {{StatusEffectLink|ArmorBoost}} buff during this attack, making it extremely difficult to kill until the attack is over.

The skill has a cooldown of 60 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special on friendlies''': the Dunestrider must be within 50m of an ally and have less than 25% health.
# '''Use special on enemies''': the Dunestrider must be within 50m of a player and have less than 25% health.
# '''Use secondary''': the Dunestrider must be within 20-60m from its target and have less than 75% health.
# '''Use primary while strafing''': the Dunestrider must be within 50m from its target and the skill doesn't have to be off cooldown.
# '''Use primary while approaching''': the Dunestrider must be within 50-100m from its target and the skill doesn't have to be off cooldown.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Mired Urn]]''

If the Clay Dunestrider is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Clay Dunestrider) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the  {{ItemLink|Mired Urn}}.

== Tips ==
* Players with poor mobility and sub-par movement skills must avoid the Clay Dunestrider while it is attempting to heal itself. While players are generally able to maintain their distance from the Dunestrider if they backpedal, getting fully caught by the boss will result in them having to wait until the attack ends before they regain control of their movement - assuming they don't die in the process.
* If multiple Dunestriders are present and the player lacks mobility, it might be wise to focus one at a time. The pulling effect of Life-Draining Tendrils can stack, and with lesser movement, it can become inescapable.
* It only takes a one or two movement items to be able to comfortably dodge both of the Clay Dunestrider's clay ball attacks (particularly jumping perpendicular to direction of the balls with {{ItemLink|itemName=Wax Quail}}), even at close range. If the player doesn't happen to have any movement items when encountering one, it's wise to stick to high ground to avoid the Rolling Balls attack. Be mindful, however, that simply standing atop a rock won't necessarily be enough to avoid the attack; there are situations where the level geometry is just shallow enough to allow the balls to roll up and across them.
* While the Dunestrider's life drain can be a source of frustration, it can also be an opportunity to inflict heavy damage upon the boss. Despite the large armor increase for the duration of the attack, the boss's health can still be whittled down if the party is proactive and makes an effort to kill all nearby monsters before the boss gets the chance to suck them in. This will greatly reduce the amount of health the Dunestrider ends up regaining.
** If the party has a large number of crowd control items, such as {{ItemLink|Gasoline}} or {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}, it may be advantageous to allow a large number of monsters to be consumed before killing them all at once.
** If the player doesn't have enough dps to kill the Dunestrider, they can hedge their bets by getting it as close as possible to 25% health and waiting until it raises to do the tarball attack. This gives the player a lot more time to do damage before the siphoning begins as long as they are confident they can avoid the tar balls.
* Since the Dunestrider's life-draining attack involves the boss healing itself, the Dunestrider is one of five enemies (the others being the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mini Mushrum}}, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Kipkip the Gentle}}, and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}}'s fourth phase if the player has healing items) that can be meaningfully affected by the Malachite {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HealingDisabled|altText=healing disabled}} debuff. 
** This can be accomplished if the player has obtained and equipped {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Retort}}, summoned a Malachite ghost using the {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}}, or defeated a Malachite Elite while holding the {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}. It is also possible for a Malachite enemy to damage and debuff the Clay Dunestrider if the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is enabled, although this is unreliable.
** Even if the Dunestrider becomes unable to heal itself, it is still capable of using its tendrils to damage everything around it and gain massive armor. It will become easier to kill without its healing but is just as dangerous nonetheless.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a sentient clay [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Clay Templar's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Rapid Fire ===
The Templar winds up its cannon for 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) before shooting 20 rapid hail of tar bullets per second in a wide cone with a spread of up to 4°. Due to the bullets' spread, this skill's damage falls off at longer distances even though the bullets themselves have no [[Damage#Damage Falloff|damage falloff.]] 

Each bullet deals 32.5% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.05 and has a range of 300m. 

When the Templar finishes firing, there is an end lag of 2 seconds, which scales with attack speed. 

This skill has no cooldown and the only delay is the wind up and end lag. For the duration of the skill the Templar also {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50|altText=moves at reduced speed}}. 

=== Secondary: Tar Blast ===
The Templar emits a short-ranged tar blast similar to {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Disperse|altText=REX's Disperse}}. This has a range of 20m in a field of view of 40° and pushes targets away while inflicting {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} for 4 seconds. 

This skill has a cooldown of 2 seconds, a proc coefficient of 0.0, and an animation duration of 1.3 seconds which scales with attack speed. 

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use secondary''': the Templar must be within 20m from its target and aiming at it.
# '''Use primary and chase''': the Templar must be within 10-75m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will be active for 2 seconds.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* The Templar's lethal ranged attacks are best avoided through the use of cover, as the Templar can effectively track and fire upon [[Survivors]] even at a distance, and even if they move quickly. 
** Alternatively, Survivors can outright prevent the Templar from attacking by stunning it, since it must wind up again after being interrupted.
*** Strafing to its back will also cause it to stop firing. The wind up and end lag delay of the primary skill gives a good opening for the player to damage the Templar unopposed.
** Getting closer to the Templar will make it harder for it to track a survivor, though care should be taken not to get close enough for it to use Tar Blast.
* The {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} will mitigate the damage taken from the Templar's bullets, although it will fall off in effectiveness in later stages as enemies become more powerful.
** Similarly, the {{ItemLink|Planula|altText=Planula's}} healing can greatly increase survivability against the Templar, and with enough Armor Plates it is possible to get net positive healing when attacked. However, given the Planula's extremely limited availability, this is generally only useful when using the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} or {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}}.
** With some {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate|altText=Repulsion Armor Plates}} and at least one {{ItemLink|Roll of Pennies}} enough gold can be quickly generated to last the whole stage.
* It can be easier to trigger the effects of {{ItemLink|Death Mark}} on a Clay Templar due to it giving itself a debuff while using its primary skill.

* The Clay Templar may be related to the [[Ror:Clay Man|Clay Man]], a monster in the original Risk of Rain that is unused in Risk of Rain 2's code. Both monsters are humanoid beings made of tar with a pot for a head, although Clay Men attack with a sword instead of a cannon.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

Functioning similarly to a [[3D Printers|3D Printer]], Cleansing Pools will exchange a random [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] (including [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]]) held by the player for either a {{ItemLink|Pearl}} or an {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}. The player must have at least one lunar item to activate the Cleansing Pool.

The Cleansing Pool has a 80% chance to drop a Pearl and a 20% chance to drop an Irradiant Pearl.

== Notes ==
* Cleansing Pools will ''not'' spawn in Simulacrum or with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} active.

* Cleansing Pools can currently only spawn in six environments; {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Verdant Falls}},{{EntityLink|Wetland Aspect}}, {{EntityLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}, {{EntityLink|Scorched Acres}}, {{EntityLink|Sulfur Pools}}, and {{EntityLink|Siren's Call}}.
** Based on extensive modded testing, with the tester going through over 300 of each stage, the chance for at least one Cleansing Pool to spawn is 9.66% on Wetland Aspect, 10.96% on Scorched Acres, and 15.33% on Siren's Call. The average spawn rates increase with the number of players.
*** Based on this, the chance for an Irradiant Pearl to be immediately available on these stages are 1.932% on Wetland Aspect, 2.192% on Scorched Acres, and 3.066% on Siren's Call.
** Cleansing Pools appear to occur at higher rates than usual on Aphelian Sanctuary.&lt;sup&gt;{verify}&lt;/sup&gt;

* Based on further modded testing, the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} greatly improves Cleansing Pool spawn rates, with the chances of at least one Cleansing Pool spawning roughly tripling on Wetland Aspect and Scorched Acres, and nearly doubling on Siren's Call. This is due to how the [[Directors]] populate maps with interactables; since there are no [[Chests]] to spawn, Cleansing Pools can spawn much more frequently.
** Based on this, the chance for an Irradiant Pearl to be immediately available on these stages is increased to 5.796% on Wetland Aspect, 6.576% on Scorched Acres, and 6.132% on Siren's Call.

== Tips ==
* Lunar items are characterized by their downsides, which means that gaining a large sum with the intent to convert them into pearls can prove to be dangerous. As {{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty}} are functionally irrelevant outside of accessing {{entityLink|A Moment, Whole}}, they serve as an excellent item to hold on to in the event that the player encounters a Cleansing Pool.
** Players that aren't lacking in firepower can also hold onto a lunar equipment, even if they have no intention of using it.

* A good method of getting an Irradiant Pearl is to use the {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} and {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}}. With Sacrifice enabled, the player can endlessly kill monsters and have equipment drop as a result. By repeatedly activating each equipment with Enigma enabled, the equipment will inevitably transform into a lunar equipment, which can then be used in the Cleansing Pool without spending any [[Lunar Coins|lunar coins]].  Getting one or multiple {{ItemLink|itemName=Eulogy Zero}} is another good method to get pearls with Artifact of Sacrifice since monsters will be able to drop lunar items.

* Avoid Cleansing Pools when playing as the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}. Lunar items cannot be [[Scrapper|scrapped]], and as such there is no way to guarantee that the Cleansing Pool will not remove one of her valuable Heresy items. (This is less of a concern if you have stacked multiples of those items.)

== Bugs ==
* If the player activates a Cleansing Pool while playing as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}}, and while holding 2 lunar equipment with {{SkillLink|Retool|MUL-T}}, ''both'' lunar equipment will be consumed at once, but will only yield a single Pearl. Activating the Cleansing Pool while holding one lunar equipment and one regular equipment will only consume the lunar equipment, however.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in ''Risk of Rain 2''.

Unlocked by default, he is intended as a well-rounded and easily-understood character with no particular weaknesses or strengths, combining mobility and offense in his tactics. Despite his ostensibly simple skills, Commando benefits greatly from the effects of [[Item Stacking|item stacking]] given his high attack speed and equally high [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]].

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use secondary (Phase Blast)''': Commando must be within 10m from the target and aiming at it. Commando will sprint and this behavior cannot be selected twice in a row. Due to the explicit skill stated, Commando will not use the secondary if it is either Phase Round or {{SkillLink|skillName=Slicing Maelstrom}}.
# '''Use special and stop''': Commando must be within 15m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds. If Commando is equipped with the Frag Grenade, there will be no effort to throw the grenade at the enemy's feet. The grenade will therefore either bounce off the target or miss them completely.
# '''Use utility and strafe''': Commando must be within 15m from the target and have line of sight.
# '''Flee''': Commando must be within 15m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': Commando must be within 8-19m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds. Due to the previous behavior, this is only selectable for the limited 15-19m distance range.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.
# '''Chase (unselectable)''': Commando must be within 40m from the target and have line of sight. Due to the previous behavior, this will never be selected.
# '''Use secondary (unselectable)''': Commando must be within 6m from the target and have line of sight. Due to the Chase behavior, this will never be selected. This is either a misconfiguration of the behavior order, or a remnant of an older behavior. Had this been higher in the priority list, it could have been used for Phase Round. However, with Phase Round being a projectile, one would have normally expected a longer range window for the behavior to have been selectable.

== Tips ==
* {{Color|commando|Double Tap}} has one of the highest potentials to proc item effects out of all character’s primary skill because of its rapid attack speed and high proc coefficient.
* {{Color|commando|Phase Round}}, {{Color|commando|Phase Blast}}, {{Color|commando|Suppressive Fire}} and {{Color|commando|Frag Grenades}} reset the accuracy spread of {{Color|commando|Double Tap}}. To maximize long-range damage, {{Color|commando|Double Tap}} a bit before using any of these skills so that they reset its accuracy, then {{Color|commando|Double Tap}} again. To similar effect, repeatedly pressing the button (through use of a turbo button or attempting to develop carpal tunnel) instead of holding it lowers your fire rate slightly but massively increases commando's accuracy at long range. 
* {{Color|commando|Tactical Dive}} and {{Color|commando|Tactical Slide}} can be used to avoid fall damage if used before hitting the ground.
* {{Color|commando|Tactical Dive}} into upwards slopes for a huge upwards jump.
* When airborne, {{Color|commando|Tactical Slide}} will propel the player slightly forward and upward.
** The player can also jump during {{Color|commando|Tactical Slide}}, maintaining forward momentum and allowing the player to jump gaps otherwise unable to.
* Strangely, {{Color|commando|Tactical Dive}} is programmed to reset the cooldown on Commando's primary. This obviously has no impact on his normal skills, but if {{ItemLink|itemName=Visions of Heresy}} is equipped, rolling while the skill is on cooldown will immediately reset it.
** Stranger still, this will only restock the first stack of Hungering Gaze; if further stocks are obtained via stacking the roll will only grant 12 charges, making this strange interaction even more situational.
* {{Color|commando|Suppressive Fire}} can be used to stun enemies and briefly interrupt attacks, though it should be noted the stun doesn't last very long.
* {{Color|commando|Suppressive Fire}} has a brief "end lag" animation which prevents the player from using {{Color|commando|Double Tap}} for a short time. However, since all other skills can be used during this time, it is recommended to use {{Color|commando|Phase Round}} or {{Color|commando|Phase Blast}} to cancel the animation at the end, and maintain the highest possible damage output.
** {{Color|commando|Frag Grenades}} have a similar but shorter "end lag" animation.
* {{Color|commando|Frag Grenades}} are the sole AoE attack Commando possesses, and are also the only other way Commando can activate {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}, {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} and {{ItemLink|Singularity Band}} with his abilities besides {{Color|commando|Phase Round}}.
**Although {{Color|commando|Phase Round}} can activate the Bands as well, {{Color|commando|Frag Grenades}} are still more effective since the Bands deal [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]]. {{Color|commando|Phase Round}} also cannot activate the Bands without piercing at least one enemy.
*{{Color|commando|Frag Grenades}} are not stunning, but they can briefly stagger enemies.
*{{Color|commando|Frag Grenades}} activate the {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overloading}} exploding orbs when they [[Damage#On-Hit Anything|bounce off terrain]], allowing for a constant stream of explosions from grenade bounces.

==Trivia==
*Commando was one of the original playable characters in the first Risk of Rain.
*Prior to Skills 2.0, Commando's Suppressive Fire did not scale with attack speed.
*Curiously, Commando's default utility is programmed to restock his primary attack; which has no cooldown to begin with. As {{Color|commando|Tactical Slide}} doesn't share this quirk and it is not listed anywhere, it is almost certainly a relic from an earlier design of the character that was simply intended to be dummied out.
**This functionality was likely a reloading system similar to what {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}} would later make use of. This can even be observed if Bandit is somehow able to use Tactical Roll, as it will instantly reload his primary, and vice-versa if Commando is given Bandits primary.
*Commando was the first Survivor to be worked on in both ''Risk of Rain'' and ''Risk of Rain 2''.
*Unlike every other Survivor, Commando's in-game icon features an older model from early in the game's development.
*Prior to the Anniversary Update, the '''Commando''''s ending phrase was {{Color|#959494|"..and so he left, with everything but his humanity."}}, reiterating their ending message from the first [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]].
*The Commando appears in Dead Cells as an outfit for the player character, the Beheaded. Its description reads {{Color|grey|And so he left, with everything but his humanity.}}, mirroring their ending message from pre-Anniversary RoR2 and its predecessor.
*Corpses of Commandos, such as on the main menu and surrounding the rescue ship on [[Commencement]], points to the possibility that the playable Commando is a member of a contingent of soldiers sent to aid in the rescue mission that serves as the game's basis.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}} is very likely a member of the same contingent that was captured and trapped in the void before the events of the game. Its been confirmed that they are not the same Commando from the first game, meaning at least three members are known to exist.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} by fully charging the [[Teleporter]] of the first [[Environments|stage]] before the timer hits 5 minutes.

== Tips ==
* This can be done more easily in the [[Prismatic Trial]] since the Teleporter instantly charges once the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]] is defeated. 
** Since Prismatic Trials have a set seed, it is also possible to develop an optimal strategy to handle the boss.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} by completing 20 [[Environments|stages]] in a single run without picking up any [[Items#Lunar|lunar items]] or [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]].

==Notes==

*Contrary to the name of the challenge, picking up [[Items#Void|{{Color|void|void}}]] items does not invalidate the challenge. This is due to the fact that this challenge existed before void items were added ([[Survivors of the Void Update]])
*[[Lunar Coins]] can still be picked up, as they do not count as lunar items.
*Lunar items can still be bought without failing the challenge, although Commando still cannot collect them.
*If you are under the effects of {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} and you reroll an equipment into {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}, this will not invalidate the challenge.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} by killing an {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}.

==Tips==
* In multiplayer, only the player landing the killing blow will complete the challenge. The challenge is also not completed if a non-player ally like a [[Interactables#Drones|drone]] kills the Overloading Worm.
*Playing on {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}} and activating [[Shrine of the Mountain|Shrines of the Mountain]] can increase the chance of an Overloading Worm spawning during the [https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Teleporter#:~:text=7%20Version%20History-,Teleporter%20Event,-Activating%20and%20completing Teleporter Event].
*Playing with the artifact [https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Artifacts#Swarms Swarms] can make the challenge easier since there is double the chance of landing the final blow on an Overloading Worm.
*The [[Trophy Hunter's Tricorn]] can be a used for this challenge, it can be completed immediately when the equipment blow is landed on an Overloading Worm.

'''Commencement''' is the final stage [[Environments|Environment]] added in the ''1.0'' Update, and revised in the Anniversary Update. It is located on the moon of {{EntityLink|Petrichor V}}.

The {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} will allow its selected [[Monsters|monster]] to spawn, but not prevent the {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Exploder)}}, {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)}}, or {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}} from spawning.

==Description==
Commencement is a large domain located above the shattered breach of Petrichor V's moon. It is ostensibly the desolated seat of {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=Mithrix's}} power. 

It is made up of the shattered remains of four individual sections, emblematic of Mithrix and Providence's tools of creation: 
* The area where Pillars of Design are found appears to be a workshop of sorts, with the unfinished remains of a Lunar Chimera Golem. The upper half of one remains suspended by large chains as if abandoned in the midst of construction.
* The Pillars of Blood are found within a large circular arena, encircled by tall pillars with raised platforms resembling seating.&lt;!-- This section needs 2 more bullet points to describe all four sections of Commencement, like the previous sentence described --&gt;

Raised high above the rest of the grounds by what appears to be a titanic arm is a massive circular area, where Mithrix himself remains.

The player spawns in an underground area, facing the Rescue Ship and Mithrix's Arena. Outside the Rescue Ship are 5 dead [[Commando]]s.

==Releasing the Rescue Ship==
Upon entering the main area of the stage, the player will discover a Rescue Ship protected by an unbreakable force field. Their new objective will be to find a way to release the Rescue Ship in order to escape the planet.

Different pillars are scattered around the stage, with a total of 4-7 pillars spawning. The player's objective is to activate and charge (i.e. complete the holdout event) 4 of them in order to activate [[Launch Pads|jump pads]] that will lead to {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}, the final boss. There are 4 different pillar areas, each having the potential of spawning up to 4 pillars with a radius of 20m and their unique way of charging:

* Pillars of Mass take 60 seconds to charge, and have no special properties.
* Pillars of Design take 30 seconds to charge and release shock waves during the process. These deal no damage, but they push the player away and inflict the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}} status, reducing their [[armor]] by 20 and [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] by 50%. The shock waves can be avoided by repeatedly jumping.
* Pillars of Soul take 30 seconds to charge, but their charging radius will shrink the more they charge. The pillar's charge also rapidly decreases if all players leave the charging zone by 10% per second.
* Pillars of Blood take 10 seconds to charge, but they absorb the health of the player in the process. The pillar will drain 10% health per second (2.5% per tick, so it can be affected by the [[Eclipse]] 8 modifier), for a total of 100% over the charging duration.
** For Eclipse 8, having any form of damage reduction (such as a single {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}, or via armor from items like {{ItemLink|Rose Buckler}} or playing a character with innate armor such as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}) will make the damage taken from the pillar not add curse.

File:Pillar of Design.png|Pillar of Design
File:Pillar of Soul.png|Pillar of Soul
File:Pillar of Blood.png|Pillar of Blood
&lt;/gallery&gt;

It is not necessary to activate any of the pillars if the player has enough movement items (e.g. {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}, {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather}}) or movement abilities to make it to the boss arena and trigger the fight. 

Once Mithrix is defeated, the moon will begin a detonation sequence with an on-screen countdown. The players have 3 minutes to get to the Rescue Ship and complete its holdout event in order to escape. The event requires them to 'protect' the ship by staying within the surrounding zone for 1 minute. Walls of blue flames will appear, similar to those created by some of Mithrix's attacks. {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}} and Chimeras will spawn and attack the player, very occasionally entering the protection zone of the rescue ship. 

The holdout zone has a radius of 40m and it is not affected by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Focused Convergence}}. Notably, its shape is cylindrical and extends all the way up to the sky. This makes it possible to fly high up to avoid any enemy attack for the duration of the event by utilising, e.g., character movement abilities, the {{ItemLink|itemName=H3AD-5T v2}} by jumping on the slope of the ceiling of the rescue ship, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Milky Chrysalis}}, or the{{ItemLink|itemName=Volcanic Egg}}. However, although the Rescue Ship can charge at any height, the ship itself will not leave and save the player until they are close enough. In other words, players too far above the ship cannot leave even at 100% charge. 

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" mode="packed" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;
File:Commencement - Rescue Ship Holdout.jpg|Defend the rescue ship during the detonation sequence
&lt;/gallery&gt;

 

After completing this event, the game is over. An ending cinematic is played during which the ship can be seen flying away from the moon. Shortly thereafter, a purple void sphere grows from the center of the moon before vanishing in a flash of light, taking the moon with it.

There is a loophole to have the character present during the end game report after the ending credits. When the escape zone is charged to 99%, the game will slowly fade to white before showing the ending cutscene. Before transitioning to the cutscene, the game despawns the stage and all objects. If the player has a {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}}, or a {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}} and dies while the screen is fading to white, the player will be revived after the game has despawned everything and therefore will evade this process. During the end game report screen the character will now be present, but as there is no ground they will be eternally falling into nothingness. This is most easily achieved by charging the escape zone to 98%, killing a Void Reaver, dipping in the zone to charge it to 99%, and then dying to the Void Reaver's implosion. If the player dies after charging the zone, but they don't have an item to revive themselves, the game will still count it as a win, which means the result is marked the moment the zone is fully charged and not when the screen has completely faded to white. Any deaths occuring during the fade-to-white will also not count towards the final report.

== Cauldrons &amp; Lunar Pods==
On the left end side of the stage, near where the Pillars of Design spawn, there will be 5 [[Bazaar Between Time#Cauldrons|Cauldrons]], randomly selected from 12 {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} and 10 {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} Cauldrons. 0-2 Common Cauldrons will also spawn, which are unique to Commencement and will exchange one red item into three of the displayed item. (This area is colloquially referred to by the community as "Soup Island").

On the right side of the stage, near where the Pillars of Soul spawn, there will be 0-7 [[Lunar Pod]]s that can be attached to walls and in other unusual places. Internally, the game selects 7 objects from a list of 17 Lunar Pods and 32 other irrelevant objects, so the chance to find any number of Lunar Pods is not uniform. To calculate how many Lunar Pods are likely to spawn, one can use combinatorics:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\binom{17}{k}\times\binom{32}{7-k}}{\binom{49}{7}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the number of Lunar Pods that will spawn. A similar formula can be used to estimate the chance of getting ({{Color|uncommon|5}}, {{Color|legendary|0}}), ({{Color|uncommon|4}}, {{Color|legendary|1}}), etc, Cauldron pairs.

{{Clear}}
==Shrine of Order==
A [[Shrine of Order]] will always spawn on a floating rock behind the area where Pillars of Mass spawn (left of the map when starting from the Rescue Ship, see the [[Commencement#Overview|Overview]] section).
&lt;gallery class="nobackground" mode="packed" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

{{Clear}}

== Glass Frog ==
A glass frog can be found during the escape sequence. It can be found by returning to the Teleporter ring at the start of the level after defeating {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}. Interacting with the frog costs {{LunarCoin|1}}. If the [[Survivors of the Void]] DLC is enabled, petting the frog 10 times (thus using {{LunarCoin|10}}) will spawn a {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium|altText=Deep Void portal|displayIcon=false}}.

This Easter egg was requested on the official Discord. The {{ItemLink|Purity}} log refers to "glass frogs", implying that the frog could be more than an Easter egg.

==Logbook Entry==
Like the [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]], Commencement's Logbook Entry is obtained through picking up an Environment Log. Said Environment Log is located within the central hole underneath the boss's arena. It will disappear 5 minutes after entering the level.

==Trivia==
*The internal name of the current iteration of the stage is "moon2" because the old version before the [[Anniversary Update]] was "moon". This still exists in the game's data files but it is unused.
*The implosion of the Moon in the ending cinematic is reminiscent of the death implosion of a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}}, albeit on a planetary-sized scale. It could be assumed that the Moon was not actually destroyed, but rather 'detained' in the same way that something caught within the Void Reaver's implosion is described as.
** The [[Alternate Game Modes|Simulacrum]] version of Commencement is located in its boss arena, possibly suggesting the events of Simulacrum take place after the Moon's detainment.

* The Pillars in this stage are all based on the 4 elements of the universe Mithrix found. What they are, how they function, and how they look are all taken from the [[Bulwark's Ambry]] log.
**"...Round, with no features. No orientation. It is mass. Almost everything here is mass. Mass is boring, but required." The Pillar of Mass is the blandest in design, and has no effects. Featureless and boring.
**"...Features, angles, and intent. Look at the planarity of the surfaces. This is design. I love design." The Pillar of Design has a clear design unlike most of the other pillars, and has a distinct feature - its twisted design.
**"...a volatile one - a lifeline. Blood. Sharp, yet radiant. Blood is heat. This is my blood, but there is plenty of blood in this universe." The Pillar of Blood is literally a pillar made of blood. Perhaps made of Mithrix's blood given the log, and how desolate the moon seems to be. 
***Prior to the map's redesign, a Pillar of Blood could be found near the Cauldrons as decoration.
**"Now be gentle. Look closely here. Do you see it? Almost invisible, a thin film. Frail. It’s not in this reality, but an adjacent one. I’ve heard you discuss this - something you innately understood. What you describe as soul. Don’t you love soul?" The Pillar of Soul is nearly invisible, and it being the frailest of the elements, it requires the most amount of attention when charging.

*Where the Pillars of Soul are located, a stone carving resembling Providence's head can be found in a secluded corner.
**In the files, there is a full model of a statue of Providence.
*The Pillars as holdout zones are unique in that their charging time isn't affected by the number of players in the zone. This means in multiplayer it is more efficient to split and charge multiple Pillars at the same time, albeit at the risk of fighting stronger enemies individually.
*The Simulacrum version of Commencement contains various silhouettes and constellations in the void surrounding the arena. These figures are rarely seen during normal gameplay due to their distance from the arena and the fog of the Simulacrum. Some of the figures depicted include...
**Large constellations of  {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} and [[ror:Providence|Providence]]
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Grandparent}}
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lunar Chimera (Golem)}}
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}}
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Stone Titan}}
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Wandering Vagrant}}
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Elder Lemurian}}
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Hermit Crab}}
**2D Sketches similar to the ones found in the game's credits, depicting...
***Providence's Head
***{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Acrid}}
***
***Scavenger
***The line “I know the planet you trail – of water and dirt. You fear their stability. That they will consume themselves.” In the Logbook could be a reference to Earth, as it is of “Water and Dirt”, and the planet is unstable (climate change). Providence may have been worried that humans would end up killing themselves and the planet and planned to transport them to Petrichor V

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

All the player's healing is increased by 100% (''+100% per stack''), but unlike the {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}, regeneration is ''not'' increased. Additionally, all healing is applied over time; whenever the player would heal, it is instead stored in the Corpsebloom. Every 0.2 seconds, the Corpsebloom takes from this store and heals the holder up to 2% of their maximum health (up to 10% per second). This healing cap is ''halved'' per additional stack. 

The healing increase scales [[Item Stacking#Linear Stacking|linearly]], while the amount of maximum health that can be healed scales [[Item Stacking#Hyperbolic Stacking|hyperbolically]].

== Notes ==
* The holder can only store up to 100% of their maximum health as healing.
* The {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}} affects the Corpsebloom twice: it increases the healing when it is stored, and increases it again when the healing is actually applied. Additionally, the Rack's second healing increase is applied ''after'' the Corpsebloom caps the healing over time, meaning that the Rack also increases the maximum amount of health that can be recovered per second. For instance, with a single Corpsebloom and Rejuvenation Rack, the player receives 8 times as much healing and can recover a maximum of 20% of their health per second.
** Assuming the player has at least 1 Corpsebloom, the full formula for how much healing the player receives is &lt;code&gt;DirectHealing &amp;sdot; (Corpseblooms + 1) &amp;sdot; (RejuvenationRacks +1)^2&lt;/code&gt;
* Similarly to how the Rejuvenation Rack affects the Corpsebloom's healing, the effect of {{EntityLink|entityName=Eclipse5|altText=Eclipse 5|altUrl=Eclipse#Eclipse_5}} reduces healing twice when calculating the heal for Corpsebloom. This makes even a single Corpsebloom a useless item to pick up on Eclipse 5 and higher.
*Corpsebloom interferes with {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir|altText=Power Elixir's}} instant heal effect, which means the latter will not be able to prevent {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch|altText=Delicate Watches}} from breaking when the player's health falls below 25%.

== Tips ==
* Whether or not to pick up the Corpsebloom basically depends on how much healing the player currently has; if they cannot heal at least 10% of their max health per second, then the Corpsebloom is almost entirely beneficial. If their healing exceeds the cap, or they have large bursts of healing (e.g. from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Foreign Fruit}}), then the Corpsebloom will likely be detrimental.
**As a result, the Corpsebloom is generally more effective on short runs e.g. going for Mithrix without looping, and typically falls off in effectiveness on long runs, as enemies deal much more damage and thus the player must heal much more.
** By extension taking more than one Corpsebloom can be detrimental even earlier in a run.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} suffers a delay on healing from all abilities while holding Corpsebloom.
* While holding a {{ItemLink|itemName=Planula}} and a Corpsebloom, the user heals 30 HP upon taking damage. The Planula is unlikely to exceed the Corpsebloom's healing cap.
* {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} heals 18.2% of the user's max health total over 3 seconds. While holding {{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}} and one Corpsebloom, {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} heals 30% of max health while intangible and the remaining 6.4% of max health 1 second later.
* Stand still while holding{{ItemLink|itemName=Bustling Fungus}} to store healing quickly. This can be useful during waiting periods or between waves of various battles.

== Math ==
The maximum healing per second is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;0.1 &amp;sdot; 1/(amount)&lt;/code&gt;

== Trivia ==
* Initially, the Corpsebloom would give the player a 5% critical strike chance and a chance to "critically heal," doubling the amount of HP restored. The chance for this to happen would be determined by &lt;code&gt;critstat/corpseblooms&lt;/code&gt;, and the player's chance to deal critical damage would be lowered by this amount. This was abandoned before the Early Access release because "[crit heal] wasn't as cool as it sounded".&lt;ref&gt;https://discordapp.com/channels/417739215355510784/565729054620385280/625517252397236224&lt;/ref&gt; The Corpsebloom still has the internal name 'CritHeal' as a relic from this early development stage. This is not to be confused with 'HealOnCrit', which would be the {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}.
* In the RoR2 Discord poll of October 7th 2019, the Corpsebloom was voted the least favorite lunar item.&lt;ref&gt;https://discordapp.com/channels/417739215355510784/565632840440741888/630710113602371584&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''. It is completed by entering 3 unique portals. &lt;!-- Does the Artifact Portal in Sky Meadow count? --&gt;

== Tips ==
* The Blue, Gold and Celestial [[Teleporter#Orbs &amp; Portals|Portals]] can all be accessed after completing a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]].
** The Blue Portal can spawn randomly, or the player can activate a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] with 1 [[Lunar Coins|Lunar Coin]].
** The Gold Portal spawns after the player activates an [[Altar of Gold]]. One can also access the {{EntityLink|entityName=Gilded Coast}} by dreaming at the Lunar Seer in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}}.
*The Celestial Portal spawns on {{EntityLink|entityName=Rallypoint Delta}}, {{EntityLink|entityName=Scorched Acres}} and {{EntityLink|entityName=Sulfur Pools}}, after the player has [[Environments#Looping|looped]] at least once.
*The [[Bazaar Between Time#Null Portal|Null Portal]] can be found in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Crowbar|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder attacks an enemy that has more than 90% of its health remaining, they deal 75% more damage (''+75% per stack''). 

== Notes ==
* After stacking two or more Crowbars, the total damage dealt is greater than a critical strike.
* This item is best used with [[Survivors]] with high single-hit damage, such as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}}, {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}}, and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=False Son}}. 
** However, all Survivors can make effective use of the Crowbar with [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] such as the {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} or {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}.
* The bonus damage from the Crowbar is calculated on a per-hit basis, so extra attacks from [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] items do ''not'' account for its bonus damage, unless they also hit an enemy that is above 90% health.
*Crowbars, and similarly  {{ItemLink|Voidsent Flame}}, can become difficult to use in multiplayer or with damage-dealing allies, as they can reduce an enemy's health below 90% and prevent one from utilizing the damage increase.

==Trivia==
* The Crowbar is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Half-Life (series)|Half Life]] series created by [[wikipedia:Valve Corporation|Valve]], in which the main character Gordon Freeman uses a crowbar similar to the one depicted as his melee weapon.
**The text from [[ror:Crowbar|the first game's logbook entry,]] "until the 3rd edition arrives," as well as this game's updated entry adding that "the second edition" is "getting a little old" are digs at the long production time of the [[wikipedia:Half-Life (series)|Half-Life series]] and Valve's seeming dislike of the number 3, going as far as making Half-Life 1, 2 and Half-Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2. Because of this, Half-Life 3 has become a well-known point of humor on the internet joking about how it will never come out.
*The logbook entry may also be a reference to the ''Pokémon'' anime, in which a pair of characters also named Jesse and James are thieves for the criminal organization known as Team Rocket. In the series, James is often found doing all the physical labor, while Jesse slacks off or raids the remaining food or supplies the duo have. They also consistently have little to no money in the series, reflected by how the pair are breaking into a chest whose payment mechanism is broken.

      <text bytes="45468" sha1="f7smga3jtp0c6cj51re89xvfibqhy1m" xml:space="preserve">== Inflicting Damage ==
A character's base damage is the main factor all other damage scales off of.

An accumulator is built with base value of 1.0, to which any of the following contributions are added together:
# +0.1 for each instance of [[BoostDamage]] the character has.
#+x &amp;sdot; (teamSize - 1), where ''x'' is the number of {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}} held by the summoner (only relevant for the Solus Probes spawned by said item).
# -0.05 for each stack of the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BeetleJuice}} debuff (inflicted by {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Queen|altText=Beetle Queen's}} flying beetles).
#+0.5 if {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Power Buff}} is active.
#+0.1 for each {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}.
#+0.07 if the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Saving Grace}} buff.
#+(2^x -1) where where ''x'' is the number of {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} stacks held. For example, for two stacks this will add 3 to the base 1 multiplier, for effectively quadruple damage.
#-0.3 if the character holds the Elite Void equipment (only granted to {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} characters).

This multiplier is applied to the character's base damage plus their level's damage plus their accumulated bonus damage from {{ItemLink|itemName=Prayer Beads}}. After this, the following reductions and increases are applied in order: 
#If the character is an {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|Umbra}}, multiply their damage by 0.04.
#If the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} is enabled and the character is on the player team, multiply their damage by 5.
#If the character has any {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Increase Damage}} stacks, increase their damage by &lt;code&gt;(baseDamage + levelDamage) &amp;sdot; buffStacks &amp;sdot; (0.035 + (itemStacks - 1) &amp;sdot; 0.01)&lt;/code&gt;. This value is only scaled by the character's base damage stat and level, without taking into account any damage boost from Prayer Beads. Furthermore, since this is an additive effect, it is not affected multiplicatively by previous contributions, e.g., Artifact of Glass.
# If the character is {{SkillLink|Natural Toxins|REX|weakened}}, multiply their damage by 0.6.
#If the {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} is active, multiply their damage by 2.
#If the character has {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}}, multiply their damage by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.04 &amp;sdot; itemStacks &amp;sdot; buffStacks&lt;/code&gt;, where ''buffStacks'' is the number of {{StatusEffectLink|Boost All Stats}} buff stacks held.
#If the Spinel Tonic is not active and the character has at least 1 Tonic Affliction, multiply their damage by 0.95^x, where ''x'' is the amount of Tonic Afflictions held.

===Critical Strike===
All [[Survivors]] have a base 1% critical strike chance, and [[monsters]] have a 0% base chance with the exception of {{MonsterLink|monsterName=False Son (Boss)}} who also has 1% base chance.
*If {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} is performing a {{SkillLink|skillName=Backstab|survivorName=Bandit}} attack, the hit will be marked as critical regardless of the current critical strike chance.
*Due to {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}}'s passive, she cannot get random critical strikes and instead she is guaranteed to get them when hitting weakpoints on monsters. The base 1% critical means she will deal 2.01x damage instead of the usual 2x for most survivors.
*The [[Proc Coefficient]] does not affect critical strike chances.

The critical strike multiplier is how much the damage of an incoming hit will be scaled by. It has a base value of 2.0 and can be increased by 1.0 for each {{ItemLink|Laser Scope}} stack.

The critical strike chance is then calculated by the following item and buff contributions.

#{{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} +10% per stack.
#{{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}} +5% max.
#{{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}} +5% max.
#{{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}} +5% max.
# {{StatusEffectLink|Full Crit}} +100%.
# {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}} +10% per stack.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} +7%.
#If the character is {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}}, set the critical strike chance to 0, and instead add this accumulated value to the critical strike multiplier scaled by 0.01.
# If the character has {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}}, multiply their critical strike chance by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.04 &amp;sdot; itemStacks &amp;sdot; buffStacks&lt;/code&gt;, where ''buffStacks'' is the number of {{StatusEffectLink|Boost All Stats}} buff stacks held. This means Railgunner does not benefit from this item.

===Hit Damage===
Each hit has damage info. This is scaled (possibly indirectly) from the character's damage. It holds the following properties: the attacker, the damage, if it is a critical strike, the damage type, the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]], the proc chain, position and force for knockback-related calculations, the damage color and if the damage was rejected for displaying the damage. Upon hitting a character, the following things are done in order:  
#The character applies the damage to themselves. (see: [[Damage#Receiving Damage|Receiving Damage]])
#The game checks if on-hit items need to trigger and DoTs need to be applied. (see: [[Damage#On-Hit Character|Handling Hits]])
#The game checks if the attack needs to explode. (see: [[Damage#On-Hit Anything|Handling Hits]])
Note that bullet attacks will always execute the 3rd step whether they hit a character or terrain in their path, while steps 1 and 2 require the hit to be on a character. Note that since{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Flamethrower}} technically fires a bullet with a wide radius at frequent intervals, it will also proc the explosive effects if it hits any terrain. Laser-like attacks, such as the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Solus Probe|altText=Solus Probe's}} and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Stone Titan|altText=Stone Titan's}} attacks are also implemented in the same way.

Explosive projectiles will also trigger the 3rd step upon making contact with anything. The majority of such projectiles are programmed to explode upon impact, but some detonate a certain time after impact. The impact itself does not cause any damage, but it carries a damage and proc coefficient value for triggering the explosive procs. This is how {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando|altText=Commando's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Frag Grenade}} can proc {{ItemLink|itemName=Brilliant Behemoth}} on every bounce. Note that if a character is directly hit by such a projectile, the proc effects for the 3rd step will be triggered once for the impact and then all steps 1-3 will be executed for the explosion. As such, if a character is hit directly by an {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overloading}} {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Wandering Vagrant|altText=Wandering Vagrant's}} [[Wandering Vagrant#Secondary: Homing Orb Bomb|Homing Orb Bomb]], for example, they will be inflicted with two Overloading exploding orbs.

===Attack Speed===
Attack speed is a statistic that mainly controls the animation duration of attacks. In certain circumstances it also controls the recharge period, i.e., {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}}, {{SurvivorLink|Bandit|Bandit's}} primary attacks, and {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} M99 sniper. It can also affect the number of attacks performed within a fixed duration, such as for {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer's}} Flamethrower and {{SurvivorLink|Commando|Commando's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppressive Fire}}. With the release of [[Seekers of the Storm]], attack speed also affects the cooldown for Artificer's and {{SurvivorLink|CHEF|CHEF's}} primary attacks. 

Attack speed starts at a base value of 1.0 (with the exception of {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} who starts with 0.8) and the following items and buffs contribute towards it: 

#{{ItemLink|Squid Polyp}} gives +1.0 per stack to any spawned Squid Turrets.
#{{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}} gives +0.15 per stack.
#{{ItemLink|Mocha}} gives +0.075 per stack.
#{{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}} gives +.5 per stack to any summoned drones.
#{{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}} gives +0.12 for each stack of the{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AttackSpeedOnCrit}} buff, limited to 3 stacks of the buff ''(+2 per stack)''.
#{{ItemLink|Warbanner}} gives +0.3 from the{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Warbanner}} buff.
#{{ItemLink|War Horn}} gives +0.7 from the{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Energized}} buff.
#{{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron}} and {{ItemLink|Gorag's Opus}} both give +1 from the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=WarCryBuff|altText=War Cry}}/{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TeamWarCry}} buffs, respectively (these do ''not'' stack with each other as only one can be active at a time).
# {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}} gives +0.1 per stack.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} gives +0.07.

The following items act multiplicatively on the above summed terms, which affects how effective the bonuses are.
#{{ItemLink|Light Flux Pauldron}} multiplies this by 1/(1 + stacks), but it will not reduce the attack speed value to less than 0.1.
#* In more detail, Light Flux Pauldron multiplies this by 1/(1 + stacks), then {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bolstering Lantern Attack Speed}} adds +0.1 per stack and then this value is adjusted as &lt;code&gt;max(value, 0.1)&lt;/code&gt;. Bolstering Lantern's order in the calculations may have been accidental as it makes more sense to have it as an additive contribution before this point.
#The {{StatusEffectLink|BeetleJuice}} debuff multiplies this by 1 - 0.05 &amp;sdot; x, where ''x'' in the number of stacks.
#{{SurvivorLink|False Son}} multiplies this by 1 + 0.05 &amp;sdot; x, where ''x'' is the number of secondary attack stocks available. For the default 4 stacks and with no other attack speed contributions, this makes False Son's attack speed 0.96.
#{{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} multiplies this by 1.7 while the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TonicBuff}} is active.
#If the character has {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}}, multiply their attack speed by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.04 &amp;sdot; itemStacks &amp;sdot; buffStacks&lt;/code&gt;, where ''buffStacks'' is the number of {{StatusEffectLink|Boost All Stats}} buff stacks held.
#If the Tonic Buff is not active and the character has Tonic Afflictions, the attack speed is multiplied by 0.95^x for each stack.

===Damage Falloff===
'''Damage falloff''' is a statistic that determines whether an attack will hit at full or reduced damage. Attacks that have damage falloff discourage shooting from extreme ranges and reward accuracy with area of effect attacks. There are two falloff models: a bullet falloff model and an area of effect (AoE) falloff model.   

*'''Bullet falloff''' is used for hitscan bullet attacks, such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Burst}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Vulcan Shotgun}}. Attacks that launch an actual projectile, such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Cast Nano-Spear}}, do ''not'' use this falloff model. If an attack has bullet falloff, its final damage is determined by the distance between the attacker and the target, with three types: 
** None: Deals 100% damage, regardless of distance. For example, {{SkillLink|skillName=Blast}} is a skill that uses this type.
**Default: Deals 100% damage within 25m, linearly decreasing to a minimum of 50% at 60m or farther. Most hitscan attacks will use this type.
**Buckshot: Deals 100% within 7m, linearly decreasing to a minimum of 25% at 25m or farther. For example, {{SkillLink|skillName=Phase Blast}} is a skill that uses this type.

*'''AoE falloff''' is used for exploding attacks, such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Frag Grenade}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}}. If an attack has area of effect falloff, its final damage is determined by the distance from the explosion's center to the target, with three types:  
** None: Deals 100% damage, regardless of position inside the explosion. For example, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Brilliant Behemoth}} uses this type.
**Linear: Deals 100% damage at the explosion's center, linearly decreasing to 0% at the explosion's edge. For example, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Clay Dunestrider|altText=Clay Dunestrider's}} Rolling Tarballs uses this type.
** Sweet spot: Deals 100% from the explosion's center to half of its radius, and deals 25% from half its radius to its edge. Most exploding attacks will use this type.

==='Base' vs. 'Total' Damage===
'''Base damage''' and '''total damage''' are the two main damage types in Risk of Rain 2.  

*'''Base damage''' scales specifically with the character's base damage value. For instance, take {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}} at level 1, with a base damage stat of 12, and assume he has inflicted a single stack of{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} thanks to his {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}. The damage from bleeding deals 20% base damage per tick, so it will deal 20% x 12 = 2.4 points of damage per tick. This tick damage is ''not'' affected by the attack that inflicts the bleeding; it only will deal more damage as Commando levels up and his base damage increases.
*'''Total damage''' is used for on-hit items that generate bonus attacks. These items scale with the strength of the attack that activates them. For instance, take another level 1 Commando (still with a base damage of 12), and assume he has shot an enemy one time with {{SkillLink|skillName=Phase Round|survivorName=Commando}}, inflicting 300% x 12 = 36 damage. If Commando has one {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} and his Phase Round activates it, the missile deals 300% of the Phase Round shot, for 300% x 36 = 108 damage. If this missile in turn activates a {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}, the Sticky Bomb will deal 180% of the ''missile's'' damage, dealing 180% x 108 = 194.4 damage.

Multiple different total damage items may activate at once from a single hit, or they can activate each other, leading to cascading item activations (commonly referred to as a "proc chain"). There are several important quirks to keep in mind with regard to proc chains: 

* Total damage items calculate their final damage ''without'' accounting for any damage bonuses on the triggering hit, in order to prevent those bonuses from being repeatedly applied as the chain grows longer; instead, the bonuses are calculated on a per-hit basis. The items that are impacted by this are the {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Armor-Piercing Rounds}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}. For instance, an attack that deals 100 damage that is boosted by 1 stack of Armor-Piercing Rounds bonus will deal 120 final damage. If this attack activates an AtG Missile Mk. 1, that missile will only deal 300% x 100 = 300 damage; the extra damage from the Armor-Piercing Rounds is ''not'' taken into account when calculating its initial damage. However, if that missile strikes a boss, then it will also be boosted and deal 360 final damage.
* Total damage items only critically strike if the triggering hit was a critical strike, and can never critically strike otherwise. For example, if a non-critical attack deals 100 damage and activates an AtG Missile Mk. 1, the missile will deal 300% x 100 = 300 damage and is sure to not be a critical strike. If we instead assume the original attack is a critical strike, the missile will become a critical strike as well, dealing 2 x 300% x 100 = 600 final damage (note that the critical strike bonus also applies to each attack individually, similar to the above bonuses). The lone exception to this is the {{ItemLink|itemName=Charged Perforator}}, which rolls critical strike chance completely independently of the triggering hit (this may be a bug).
*A given total damage item can only activate once per proc chain. For instance, if the player activates an AtG Missile Mk. 1, that missile (and any other total damage items activated by it) will not activate the AtG Missile Mk. 1 again in that same chain. This is sometimes referred to as a "proc mask," preventing proc chains from escalating for extremely long times.

===Damage over Time===
'''Damage over time''' refers to negative [[Status Effects|status effects]] that cause the victim to continuously take damage until the status expires. These status effects each deal damage a certain number of times per second, and they each have a set base duration (which may be multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the attack that inflicts the debuff). 

Additionally, some of these debuffs can stack, dealing proportionally more damage per tick with more stacks. {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SuperBleeding}} are unique in that when a new stack is applied to a target, all the existing stacks of that debuff that have a lower duration remaining are "refreshed," with their durations becoming equal to the newest stack. This means that these debuffs can be infinitely stacked as long as they are continually reapplied. 

{{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|Ignite}} is a special case among damage over time debuffs, in that it does not have a definite duration; instead, its duration is proportional to the strength of the inflicting hit. For example, an attack that deals 1000% base damage will inflict Ignite for 10 seconds, but an attack dealing 100% base damage will inflict it for only 1 second. Each tick deals a constant 10% base damage (with 5 ticks per second), and Ignite's duration scales such that it always deals 50% total damage over its entire duration (for instance, a stack of Ignite inflicted by the above 1000% base damage attack would deal an additional 500% base damage over its duration).
&lt;!--*Either due to a rounding issue on the duration or some other unspecified bug, ignite deals an extra tick of damage, resulting in 52% total damage
 getting hit by a lv46 blazing brass contraption deals 1000 damage and 520 total burn damage over time, not 500, also it seems like the effect lasts for a total of 4 seconds and then burn doesnt deal damage for 1 more second even though it should last 2 seconds per this page?  also it seems like Max HP seems to have some relationship with this status, having lower HP results in lower damage ticks but the duration is extended to compensate, probably a leftover 5%hp cap from before SOTV rework? --&gt;
Having any stacks of {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank}} will replace all instances of Ignite with {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}}, which inflicts 300% more total damage over time per stack of Ignition Tank.

===Knockback===
'''Knockback''' is applied to a character upon receiving damage, pushing them away some amount. How much a victim is knocked back depends on 2 factors: the force of the attack and the victim's mass.      

*'''Force''' is a vector applied by an attack to the victim that pushes them in a direction. For instance, a bullet will apply a force in the same direction, while an explosion will apply a force away from its center.
*'''Mass''' is a statistic inherent to a given character. A character with greater mass suffers less knockback.

The final knockback applied to the victim is the quotient of the attack's force vector and the victim's mass. An attack with greater force will inflict proportionally more knockback (for instance,  {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|survivorName=Captain}} inflicts greater knockback than {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap|survivorName=Commando}}). Likewise, a victim with greater mass will receive proportionally less knockback (for instance, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Acrid}} only suffers half as much knockback as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, since Acrid has 300 mass compared to Loader's 150).

Additionally, if after knockback calculation the y-axis component of the knockback vector is less than 6, and the victim is standing on the ground, the y-axis component becomes 0 instead, so the victim is only pushed horizontally.

== Receiving Damage==
This procedure is used for players and enemies alike.

The game begins by creating a copy of the incoming damage amount. We'll call this new copy 'amount', whereas we'll call the old damage 'original amount'. 

#If the target is still protected by [[#One-Shot Protection|One-Shot Protection]], skip any further steps.
#If the attack deals damage according to the target's percent max health, overwrite the incoming damage to &lt;code&gt;targetMaxHealth &amp;sdot; 0.1&lt;/code&gt;, e.g., lightning strikes on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}.
#If the attack does not bypass blocks and the target has either succeeded the roll for {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, or has {{StatusEffectLink|Safer Spaces Ready}} active, set the damage rejected flag.
#If the attacker has {{ItemLink|Breaching Fin|Breaching Fins}} and the target is a ground enemy and the attacker has {{StatusEffectLink|Knockback Available}} or the target is airborne and can be knocked back again, juggle them. Since this juggling takes place before the process ends prematurely due to rejected damage, the target is juggled even if they have Tougher Times or Safer Spaces.
#If the target is airborne due to Breaching Fin, multiply the incoming damage by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.1 &amp;sdot; timesJuggled&lt;/code&gt;. Since this damage is passed on for procs, it means this effect double dips for proc chains.
#If the target is {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility|Invincible}} or {{StatusEffectLink|Immune}}, set the damage rejected flag.
#If the target is {{SurvivorLink|Seeker}} and is in {{SkillLink|Sojourn|altText=Sojourn Mode}} and the attack does not bypass this, set the damage rejected flag.
#If the damage has been rejected, skip any further steps.
#If the target has any {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} debuff stacks, multiply ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.1 &amp;sdot; stacks&lt;/code&gt;.
#If the attack is friendly fire, halve it for the player team and double it for any other.
#If the attack is backstabbing, set the critical strike flag.
#If the attacker has {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} and the target is above 90% of their maximum combined health, multiply ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.75 &amp;sdot; stacks&lt;/code&gt;.
#If the attacker has {{ItemLink|Voidsent Flame}} and the target is above 90% of their maximum combined health, queue the explosion to occur after 0.2 seconds.
#If the attacker has {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal|Focus Crystals}} and is within 13 meters of the target, multiply ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.2 &amp;sdot; stacks&lt;/code&gt;.
#If the attacker has {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch|Delicate Watches}}, multiply ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.2 &amp;sdot; stacks&lt;/code&gt;.
#If the attack has a nonzero proc coefficient:
##Apply any {{StatusEffectLink|Pulverize Buildup}} or {{StatusEffectLink|Pulverized}} debuffs. However, these will not affect the target's armor value for the current frame.
##If the target has the {{StatusEffectLink|Expose}} debuff and the attacker is {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, increment ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;3.5 &amp;sdot; baseDamage&lt;/code&gt; and reduce skill cooldowns by 1 second.
#If the attacker has {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}} and the target is a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|teleporter boss]], [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special boss]], or any other with a red health bar, multiply ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.2 &amp;sdot; stacks&lt;/code&gt;.
#If the hit was a critical hit, multiply ''amount'' by the critical strike multiplier. See [[#Critical Strike|Critical Strike]].
#If the attacker is {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} and the attack has hit a weak spot, multiply ''amount'' by 1.5.
#If the target has the {{StatusEffectLink|Death Mark}} debuff, multiply ''amount'' by 1.5.
#If the damage doesn't bypass [[armor]] (such as damage from a [[Shrine of Blood]] or the [[Void Fog]]), apply the armor reduction/increase to ''amount''. This can't reduce ''amount'' to less than 1. Also trigger the heal from {{ItemLink|Planula}} at this step.
# If the target is a player and ''amount'' is greater than 90% of the character's combined health, reduce the ''amount'' to 90% of the target's combined health instead. This is commonly known as '''One-Shot Protection''' or '''OSP '''for short.
#If the attack has the {{Keyword|d|Slayer}} keyword, multiply ''amount'' by &lt;code&gt;3 - 2 &amp;sdot; targetCombinedHealthFraction&lt;/code&gt;.
#If applicable, apply certain slows and roots to the character based on the damage type.
#If the attack has the {{StatusEffectLink|Expose}} flag, apply the debuff. This means if Mercenary lands a hit that applies Expose, the ''amount'' is both increased and a new debuff stack is also instantly reapplied which can be further consumed by any procs or further attacks.
#If the target has any {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown|altText=Brittle Crowns}}, take away money equal to the maximum between  &lt;code&gt;original amount &amp;sdot; Crowns&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code&gt;Crowns &amp;sdot; Money &amp;sdot; (amount/combined health)&lt;/code&gt;.
#If the target has any {{ItemLink|Roll of Pennies}}, grant &lt;code&gt;3 &amp;sdot; stacks &amp;sdot; difficultyCoefficient&lt;/code&gt; amount of money.
#If the target has [[Armor#Adaptive Armor|Adaptive Armor]] increase it by &lt;code&gt;3000 &amp;sdot; (amount / fullCombinedHealth)&lt;/code&gt;, without exceeding 400.
#If the target is on the player team and the difficulty is [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 8]] and the damage is not {{ItemLink|Warped Echo|delayed}}, apply any {{StatusEffectLink|Permanent Curse}} stacks.
#If the attack does not ignore armor and the target has the {{StatusEffectLink|Delayed Damage}} buff, multiply ''amount'' by 0.8. This damage is then split across &lt;code&gt;2 + itemStacks&lt;/code&gt; instances and is applied individually every 0.75 seconds.
#Reduce the target's barrier by ''amount'', and ''amount'' by the barrier actually removed.
#Reduce the target's shield by ''amount'', and ''amount'' by the shield actually removed.
#If the remaining ''amount'' were to reduce the target's health below 25% of their combined health and the target has {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Teleport On Low Health}}, set ''amount'' so that it will only reduce the target's health to &lt;code&gt;combinedHealth &amp;sdot; 0.25 + 1&lt;/code&gt; and grant the appropriate barrier.
#Reduce the target's health by ''amount''. If this would reduce their health below 1 and the damage is of the nonlethal type, such as {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}} self-damage or fall damage, set their health to 1 instead.
#If the target isn't player-controlled, proceed with the execution calculations: 
##If the target is frozen, set the execution threshold to 0.3.
##If the target is an Elite and their execution threshold is below the execution threshold set by {{ItemLink|Old Guillotine|altText=Old Guillotines}} of the attacker, set the execution threshold to the threshold of the Guillotines.
##If the target is not a boss and the attacker succeeds the roll for {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}}, mark the target for execution.
##If the target has been marked for execution, or their combined health is below the amount dictated by the execution threshold, set their health to 0.
#Apply knockback.
#A damage report is now created, including damage dealt, whether the target dropped below 25% health, etc, which is passed on to various processes to react to damage events, e.g., tracking achievements. Some relevant events are also mentioned below.
#Apply the following effects in an interdeterminate order:
#*If the damage is not delayed damage, reset the ''outOfDanger'' timer (affects {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}} and {{ItemLink|Oddly-shaped Opal}}).
#*Apply any stun, freeze, or hit stun effects (character is stunned if they receive more than a certain threshold of their max health as damage).
#*If the target is {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}}, gain corruption equal to &lt;code&gt;50% &amp;sdot; damageReceived / fullCombinedHealth&lt;/code&gt;.
#*{{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} returns any number stolen items if the accumulated damage has crossed the return threshold.
#If the damage is not delayed damage, apply/refresh the {{StatusEffectLink|Medkit Heal}} buff.
#If the target is below 25% health and has {{ItemLink|Power Elixir|Power Elixirs}}, consume one to heal themselves. Note that the heal will only be applied if the target has not reached 0 health and is not inflicted with {{StatusEffectLink|Healing Disabled}}.
#If the target is below 25% health and has {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}}, consume it to heal for 50% max health if possible.
# If the target is below 25% health, break all {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch|Delicate Watches}}.
# If the attack was a critical strike, {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} gains &lt;code&gt;2% &amp;sdot; procCoefficient&lt;/code&gt; corruption.
# Apply the following effects in an interdeterminate order:
#*If the target has {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}} and their health reached below 25% in the damage report, trigger the nova blast. This means that even if a target has healed themselves with a Power Elixir, this effect will still be activated.
#*If the target is tethered by an allied {{StatusEffectLink|Twisted}} elite, register the damage dealt to charge the twisted projectile.
#If the target is now dead (health less than or equal to 0), tell the game to check for on-death effects, else proc the {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} effect if available.

===One-Shot Protection ===
(See also: ''[[Health]]'')

One-shot protection is visible on the HUD as a faint overlay on the health bar, protecting the player from dying to a single instance of damage when above 90% health. "Curse" effects which lower maximum health by 10% or more, such as {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} or the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}, will remove one-shot protection.

A single hit taken cannot deal more than &lt;code&gt;(health + shield + barrier) &amp;times; 0.9&lt;/code&gt; damage. This is checked after damage-reducing effects such as armor are applied.

After receiving damage that triggers one-shot protection, the protection will remain for 0.1s, meaning health cannot be reduced below the resulting health after the initial hit.

==Handling Hits==

===On-Hit Character ===  

#If the incoming attack has a proc coefficient of 0.0 or has been rejected, exit immediately. However, if the incoming attack dealt no damage due to One-Shot Protection, but it still has a positive proc coefficient, the following checks will still be made. See [[Damage#Receiving Damage|Receiving Damage]].
#If the attack causes {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} or {{StatusEffectLink|Disable All Skills}}, inflict the appropriate debuff for 420 seconds for long duration else only for 5 seconds (e.g., Lunar Ruin by the lightning strikes on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} vs by {{SurvivorLink|False Son}}).
# If the attack causes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Poison}}, inflict the DoT for &lt;math&gt;10 \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; seconds.
#If the hit is a critical strike, apply the {{ItemLink|itemName=Harvester's Scythe}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Predatory Instincts}} effects.
# If the attacker has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Leeching Seed|altText=Leeching Seeds}}, heal for &lt;math&gt;stacks \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt;.
#If the attack causes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleed}}, or the attacker has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger|altText=Tri-Tip Daggers}} and the roll succeeds the bleed chance, or the attacker has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen|altText=Shatterspleens}} and the attack is a critical strike, inflict the DoT for &lt;math&gt;3 \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; seconds.
#If the attacker is {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} or has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Needletick|altText=Needleticks}} and the roll is successful, inflict a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Fracture}} stack.
#If the attack causes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Blight}}, infict the DoT for &lt;math&gt;5 \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; seconds.
#If the attack causes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Weak}}, inflict the debuff for &lt;math&gt;6 \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; seconds.
#If the attack causes {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Burn}} or the attacker is {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Blazing}}, inflict the DoT for 50% of the incoming damage. If the attacker holds any {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank|altText=Ignition Tanks}}, increase the Burn total damage by &lt;math&gt;3 \times stacks&lt;/math&gt;.
#If the attacker is {{StatusEffectLink|Glacial}} or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Celestine}}, inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80}} for &lt;math&gt;1.5 \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;3 \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; seconds respectively. These effects stack if the player has both affixes with {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}.

If the victim had less than 4 debuffs before the hit handled, but has since been inflicted with more up to that point, the Death Mark can be procced on the hit that lands the 4th debuff.

# If the attack is from a [[Interactables#Drones|Drone]] whose owner has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}} and the roll succeeds the 10% chance, proc a missile for &lt;math&gt;3 \times baseDamage&lt;/math&gt;.
#If the attacker has any {{ItemLink|Chronic Expansion|Chronic Expansions}}, refresh the duration of the buff.
#If the attacker has at least 3 {{StatusEffectLink|Luminous Shot Charge}} buffs and the damage is from a primary skill, proc the {{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern}} effect for &lt;math&gt;(1.75 + 0.5 \times (itemStacks - 1)) \times baseDamage&lt;/math&gt; for each lightning strike.
#If the attacker is {{SurvivorLink|CHEF}}, inflict any of the debuffs related to its skills.

#If the attack is part of a proc chain and it has not procced {{ItemLink|Electric Boomerang}} and the roll succeeds, proc it now for &lt;math&gt;0.4 \times stacks \times baseDamage&lt;/math&gt;. The blades striking the enemy have a further 3.1 damage coefficient which brings their final damage to 124% base damage for 1 stack, but the rapid damage dealt while the blades pierce an enemy only do the original 40% base damage.
===On-Hit Anything===
These are exploding effects that can be procced when an attack lands on either a character or any terrain.  

#If the incoming attack has a proc coefficient of 0.0 or has been rejected, exit immediately. However, if the incoming attack dealt no damage due to One-Shot Protection, but it still has a positive proc coefficient, the following checks will still be made. (see: [[Damage#Receiving Damage|Receiving Damage]])
#If the attacker has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Brilliant Behemoth|altText=Brilliant Behemoths}}, create a blast for &lt;math&gt;0.6 \times totalDamage&lt;/math&gt; in a radius of &lt;math&gt;(4 + 2.5 \times (stacks - 1)) \times procCoefficient&lt;/math&gt; with no falloff.
#If the attacker is {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overloading}}, create an orb that will explode after 1.5 seconds for &lt;math&gt;0.5 \times totalDamage&lt;/math&gt;. This orb can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Defensive Microbots}}.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
*Bug Fixes
**{{StatusEffectLink|Burn}} debuff no longer removes other DoT debuffs when it expires.
----
;[[Anniversary Update]]
*Quality of Life
**Graphics Updates 
***Update damage numbers to be more legible
---- 
;[[Early Access Content Update 5]] 
*Gameplay Changes 
**Slightly reworked [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|OSP]]. The goal is to fix inconsistencies and make it actually protect you from one-shots - while also fixing some abuse cases with curse.
***The threshold for OSP is now displayed on the healthbar with a faint graphic.
***Now has a lingering 0.1s duration when activated.
***🌧 Now is subtracted via Curse ({{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}, etc), i.e a curse of 10% will remove OSP entirely.
***🌧 Update OSP logic so it still triggers if you receive multiple sources of damage in the same frame that go past OSP values, i.e {{StatusEffectLink|AffixPoison|Malachite}} {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisps}}
**Melee Survivors  
*** 🌧 Melee skills will now perform more consistently at high attack speeds.
***Melee skills will now scale hitpause duration with attack speed - since the pause when hitting enemies were static, melee characters actually scaled poorly with attack speed.
*** Melee skills will now ‘hold’ you in the air better at high attack speeds.
----  
;[[Early Access Artifacts Content Update]]
* Gameplay Changes
**🌧 Update how AOE falloff is calculated to be more accurate
***''Developer Notes: This affects AOE attacks that did less damage at the edges, like Commando’s Grenade and MUL-T’s Scrap Launcher. They should now do full damage with a direct impact - however, this also affects enemies as well!''
**Characters with damage interrupt thresholds like {{monsterLink|Lesser Wisp}} and {{monsterLink|Lemurian}} now use total damage received instead of incoming damage with a crit modifier when determining whether or not they should be interrupted when hit. This makes these interrupts more likely when using items that modify damage like {{itemLink|Crowbar}} and {{itemLink|Focus Crystal}}.
*Bug Fixes 
**🌧 Fix issue which caused blast attacks to calculate hit distance based on the center of the hit hurtbox instead of the closest point. The overall effect of this is that blast attacks with falloff will do more damage since objects will now be considered closer than they were, especially against monsters with large hurtboxes like the {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan}}.
---- 
; [[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update]]
*Gameplay Changes 
**Change ‘[[Damage#One-Shot Protection|One Shot Protection]]’ calculation to include barrier
***Our intent in changing OSP in this manner is to make sure that it is a hidden mechanic, not a reliable one to build a strategy around. We know there’s still edge cases that are abusable - but as long as it’s not ALWAYS the best strategy, we don’t mind having some end-game builds that are extremely powerful.
***If you have 100% Health and 100% Barrier and take a billion damage, previously you would remain at 100% Health and 10% Barrier. You will now be at 10% Health, as intended before the inclusion of barrier in [[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres]].
*Quality of Life 
**🌧Update right edge of execution threshold bar not lining up with the actual value
---- 
;[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update]]
*QOL 
** 🌧︎ Damage numbers can now support up to 998,000,000 damage (truncated as 10K, 100K, 1M, etc)
----
;[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update]]
*Gameplay Changes 
**☂ Critical Strikes no longer double/triple/quadruple/etc “dip” through the proc chain 
***''On-hit items have accidentally been benefiting multiple times from critical strikes, resulting in each proc doubling in damage for huge multipliers. While neat, this was ultimately unintentional and not sustainable for the game going forward - so we’re ripping the bandaid now and fixing it. On-hit items have been compensated for the removal of power from this fix.''
*QOL
** Change damage with no team assigned to be Grey
*Bug Fixes   
**☂ Fix ‘Enable Damage Numbers’ not saving between playthroughs
----  
;[[Early Access Patch (Build ID No.3830295)]]
*Bug Fixes
**Reorganize fall damage code to try to fix issues with the server reporting false fall damage hits
----
;[[Early Access Patch (Build ID No.3743353)]]
*Bug Fixes
**Fixed an issue where enemies executed from freezing didn't call the correct events, leading to no money, on-kill procs, and potentially a stalled Teleporter event.
}}

==Trivia==
*If Damage Numbers are enabled in Gameplay Settings, the damage will be displayed after rounding up to the nearest integer, for a maximum of 990,000,000, abbreviated as 990M.

'''Death Do Us Part''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by discovering the hidden chamber in the [[Abandoned Aqueduct]].

Completing it unlocks {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} and {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} making them available to drop in future runs.
== Trivia ==
* The {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians}} that fight with the bands inside of the hidden chamber are implied to be married.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When the holder damages an enemy that has 4 or more unique [[Status Effects#Debuffs|debuffs]], it is{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=DeathMark|altText=marked for death}} for 7 seconds (''+7 seconds per stack''), causing it to take 50% more damage from all sources.

== Notes ==
* Players without the Death Mark will still deal bonus damage to marked enemies.
*It is possible to inflict Marked for Death on the same hit that inflicts the 4th debuff. This is because a landing hit procs some debuffs before Marked for Death is checked, while others are checked after. See [[Damage#On-Hit Character|On-Hit Procs]] for more details and the order of checks.
* The 4 debuffs do not need to be applied by the same player, but a player holding a Death Mark must damage the enemy to mark it.
**Due to this, Death Mark is typically much easier to apply in multiplayer games
* The debuff cannot be caused by an attack with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.0, so damage-over-time effects can never apply the mark, even if the victim has enough debuffs.
* The duration of the mark cannot be extended or reset after it has been applied, but it can be reapplied as normal once it expires.
* Once applied, the mark persists for its full duration even if the victim's debuffs expire such that it no longer has 4 debuffs. 
* All debuffs that can be applied to enemies count towards the activation requirement, including the {{MonsterLink|Clay Templar|altText=Clay Templar's}} self-inflicted {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50}}''.''
* Stunning an enemy, such as with {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando|altText=Commando's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppressive Fire|survivorName=Commando}} or with a {{ItemLink|itemName=Stun Grenade}}, does ''not'' contribute to the Death Mark.
* Similarly, freezing an enemy with {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Cast Nano-Spear|survivorName=Artificer}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Snapfreeze|survivorName=Artificer}} or {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|Railguneer's}} {{SkillLink|Cryocharge}} will not contribute to the Death Mark.

== Tips ==
=== Survivor Debuffs ===
* {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} can inflict either {{StatusEffectLink|Poisoned}} or {{StatusEffectLink|Blight}}, but only one (depending on loadout). 
** However, in multiplayer, one player may use Poison with Acrid while another uses Blight, which will both count towards the Death Mark.
* {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} can inflict {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|Ignite}} with {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt}} and {{SkillLink|Flamethrower}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} can inflict {{StatusEffectLink|SuperBleeding}} with {{SkillLink|Serrated Dagger}} and {{SkillLink|Serrated Shiv}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}} can inflict {{StatusEffectLink|LunarySecondaryRoot}} with {{SkillLink|Slicing Maelstrom}} and {{StatusEffectLink|LunarDetonator}} while {{SkillLink|Ruin}} is not on cooldown.
* {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Slow50}} with {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|MercExpose}} with many skills.
* {{SurvivorLink|REX}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Weak}} with {{SkillLink|DIRECTIVE: Inject}} and {{SkillLink|DIRECTIVE: Disperse}}, and can also inflict one of either {{StatusEffectLink|Entangle}} or {{StatusEffectLink|Fruiting}} with {{SkillLink|Tangling Growth}} or {{SkillLink|DIRECTIVE: Harvest}} (depending on loadout).
** However, in multiplayer, one player may use Tangling Growth with REX while another uses DIRECTIVE: Harvest, which will both count towards the Death Mark.
* {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Slow50}} with {{SkillLink|Drown}}.

=== Item Debuffs ===
While the Death Mark is best used with [[Survivors]] who can inflict debuffs naturally, there are many items that inflict debuffs as well:
* {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen}} inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}, although multiple stacks or high critical chance are required for reliability, respectively.
** The {{ItemLink|itemName=Needletick}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Fracture}}, but corrupts Tri-Tip Daggers. Bleed can still be inflicted with the Shatterspleen or by other players, however.
* {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}, the {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}}, and the {{ItemLink|Molotov (6-Pack)}} will {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=ignite}} enemies. 
** {{ItemLink|Ifrit's Distinction}} allows the holder to ignite enemies with all their skills and items.
** The {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank}} changes Ignite into {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}}. While this does not add debuffs, it does mean that a player with the Ignition Tank can inflict Stronger Burn while their allies can still inflict regular Ignite, which count separately. This can be facilitated with an {{EntityLink|Incinerator Drone}}.
* {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow60}}, which can be maintained easily with even a single stack.
** The {{ItemLink|Tentabauble}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Nullified}}, but corrupts Chronobaubles. 60% Slow can still be inflicted by other players who have Chronobaubles, however.
* {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} (along with {{ItemLink|Her Biting Embrace}} and the {{ItemLink|Spectral Circlet}}) allow the holder to apply {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80}} on hit. This debuff is independent of Chronobauble (meaning both will count for Death Mark).
* {{ItemLink|Shattering Justice}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PulverizeBuildup}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Pulverized}} (though never at the same time), which both count towards Death Mark.
* {{ItemLink|Symbiotic Scorpion}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|PermanentDebuff}}.
* {{ItemLink|Hooks of Heresy}} allow the holder to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|LunarySecondaryRoot}} using {{SkillLink|Slicing Maelstrom}}.
* {{ItemLink|Essence of Heresy}} allows the holder to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=LunarDetonator}} on hit, as long as the {{SkillLink|skillName=Ruin|survivorName=Heretic}} skill is not on cooldown.
* {{ItemLink|Mired Urn}} inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} on one nearby enemy per stack.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}} inflicts the invisible {{StatusEffectLink|Helfire}} debuff, which ''does'' contribute towards the Death Mark.
* {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Retort}} allows the holder to {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HealingDisabled|altText=disable healing}} on hit.
* The {{ItemLink|Shared Design}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Effigy of Grief}} inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}}.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Trivia ==
* Collapse used to erroneously count as 2 debuffs and not 1; this is due to how damaging debuffs are programmed. Each debuff actually has 2 components: an invisible debuff that deals the damage, and a visible ''positive'' buff that creates the icon and indicates that the debuff is inflicted. This is why the Helfire debuff counts towards the Death Mark, even though it is invisible: it has the debuff component, just not the visible buff. However, due to a programming error, ''both'' components of Collapse were treated as debuffs.
** This has been fixed as of Patch 1.2.3.

{{MonsterPage|Alpha Construct (Ally)}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|Xi Construct}}, added in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion.

Whenever the holder defeats an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] monster, a projectile launches up that spawns a friendly {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct|altImg=Alpha Construct (Ally)}} at that location, with greatly increased stats. Up to 4 (''+4 per stack'') can be spawned.

==Notes== 
*Alpha Constructs last for 30 seconds, or until killed.&lt;ref&gt;MasterSuicideOnTimer.lifeTimer = 30&lt;/ref&gt;
** However, the timer is reset and paused as long as the player is within 100m of the ally.&lt;ref&gt;MasterSuicideOnTimer.timerResetDistanceToOwner = 100&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to the global ally limit, high stacks of this item may prevent other allies from spawning, e.g., {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}} and {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea|Void Allies}}.
**The {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} makes this item very useful, as the player can accumulate an army of Alpha Constructs over the course of a stage.
*The {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} will never trigger the item's effect, even if the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} is enabled.
* Alpha Constructs spawned by the Defense Nucleus can become {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} by a {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}}, and will no longer help the [[Survivors]]. These are particularly dangerous since these allied Alpha Constructs are much stronger than a normal one.
*Unlike most other ally-summoning items, the Defense Nucleus is given to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets. Each turret tracks its own allied Alpha Construct limit separately, so a turret can spawn up to 4 extra Alpha Constructs per stack of Defense Nucleus. Turrets must be the ones to land the killing blow on Elites to spawn their own Alpha Constructs, however. If the turrets and Engineer can kill enough elites, they can have a total of 12 Alpha Construct allies with just a single Defense Nucleus. 
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Lysate Cell}} gives Engineer an extra turret, increasing the max potential to 16 Alpha Constructs.
**If a turret is a replaced, its deployable count reference will be lost while its spawned Alpha Constructs will not be affected. The new turret will then be able to spawn more Alpha Constructs.

*This item's logbook entry references a pattern in most boss item logbook entries where multiple technicians injure themselves (or come close) while attempting to study the items, such as hand injury ({{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}}), electrocution ({{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}}), and siphoning ({{ItemLink|Mired Urn}}).

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The Microbots intercept and destroy enemy projectiles, such as{{MonsterLink|Lemurian}} fireballs, within 20m of the holder. This ability recharges every 0.5 seconds, although it recharges faster with greater attack speed. The maximum number of projectiles that can be shot down at once is equal to the number of held Microbots.

Although the Defensive Microbots have a defined rarity, they '''''cannot''''' be found in [[Chests]], traded for using [[Cauldrons]] or [[3D Printers]], or obtained through any other typical method. They are near-exclusive to the {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}, who is granted one due to his {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|survivorName=Captain|altText=passive skill|altImg=Defensive Microbots (Skill)}} of the same name.

== Notes ==
&lt;!-- Notes specific to the Captain should be placed on the Captain's page under the skill notes --&gt;
* Many attacks that aren't conventional projectiles can be destroyed, such as {{MonsterLink|Mini Mushrum}} spore clouds and fire pools, {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit|Alloy Worship Unit's}} Alloy Supercharged Detonation, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} [[Monsters#Malachite|Elite]] spike pits, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} [[Monsters#Overloading|Elite]] bombs, the {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant|Wandering Vagrant's}} Homing Orb Bomb, {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Exploder)|altText=Lunar Chimera Exploder's}} fiery blaze, {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen|Beetle Queen's}} acid pools, {{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord|Imp Overlord's}} lingering shatter spikes, as well as [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] blue flame pillars and the shockwaves generated by his shockwave attack and phase 3 hammer slam. The Microbots can even destroy flying rocks on [[Sky Meadow]], though rocks destroyed this way will not grant a charge of {{ItemLink|Infusion}}.
** Hitscan attacks, like {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}} shots or {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}} lasers, ''cannot'' be blocked by Defensive Microbots, regardless of the distance between the holder and the attacker.
** The Microbots can also shoot down player projectiles. This is only relevant if the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} is active (if an Umbra has Microbots), the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is active, or if {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=Mithrix}} steals the Microbots during his final phase.
* There are only two legitimate methods of obtaining Defensive Microbots, other than starting a run as Captain:
** Risking a [[Shrine of Order]] can convert all other held legendary items into Microbots.
** Enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Metamorphosis}} and randomly becoming the Captain during a stage. His passive skill will grant the player the item, which will remain in the player's inventory even after metamorphosing into a different Survivor.
*** When starting a run as the Captain and beginning the Trial of Metamorphosis in Bulwark's Ambry, the randomly chosen Survivor will keep the Defensive Microbots for the rest of the run.
* In past versions of the game, enabling the [[Artifacts#Vengeance|Artifact of Vengeance]] and defeating an Umbra of Captain could drop Microbots. However, since the [[Survivors of the Void|Survivors of the Void Update]], this is not possible (even with the expansion disabled). Instead, playing as the Captain automatically unlocks the logbook entry for the item.
* Holding Defensive Microbots as a Survivor other than Captain will ''not'' grant allied [[Drones]] and {{EntityLink|Gunner Turret|Turrets}} their own Defensive Microbots. That ability is the result of the Captain's passive skill, not the item itself.
* The Defensive Microbots can be used as fuel for a 3D Printers and will be consumed but drones and turrets will still inherit it through the passive.
* Getting rid of the item via the 3D Printer will permanently remove it from your inventory.
*The recharge period scales as &lt;math&gt;0.5 / attackSpeed&lt;/math&gt;. As with any other inversly proportional effect, the initial increases have the highest impact.
**With an attack speed of 30 or greater the item can fire every physics frame update. For reference, this requires 194 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|Soldier's Syringes}} to achieve.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

Whenever the holder activates a [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrine]] or [[Cleansing Pool]], the Defiant Gouge summons enemies ''(more enemies per stack)'', much like a [[Shrine of Combat]] would. Shrines that can be activated multiple times will spawn enemies for each activation.

== Notes ==

*Defiant Gouges have no effect on [[Shrine of Combat|Shrines of Combat]].
* Stacking this item will cause the summoned enemies to be more powerful and/or numerous, as though the [[Difficulty#Scaling Difficulty|difficulty]] were higher. This also means that those enemies are worth more [[gold]] and EXP when they die.
**If playing with the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}}, this item can be used to acquire items more easily, as higher difficulty enemies also have higher chances to drop items. However this strategy is inherently limited by the amount of shrines one can find in any given stage.
* Just like Shrines of Combat, the difficulty scaling of the enemies spawned by this item is based on the difficulty when the player enters the level, ''not'' when the shrine is activated.
* Be careful when trying to get rid of this item through a [[Cleansing Pool]] while having multiple stacks or multiple lunar items, as every use that doesn't entirely remove this item will spawn enemies. This scenario can be particularly problematic if the stage happens to feature a [[Family Events|Family Event]], especially the {{MonsterFamily|Void}} Family Event.
*The Defiant Gouge will stop working after the difficulty gets too high per amount of item, similar to Shrines of Combat, because of the extreme cost of each enemy that needs to be spawned. ''See [[Directors]] for more.''

'''Deicide''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by defeating an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss]] on {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}} difficulty.

==Tips==

* It is possible to do this challenge while the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} is active.
*Enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} can be a good strategy, as the player will only need to kill one of the two bosses spawned. This comes with the increased challenge of surviving against twice as many enemies, however.
*A good strategy is to enable the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}}, {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}, and {{ArtifactLink|Command}}. Play as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}} using {{SkillLink|skillName=Ion Surge|survivorName=}} and an otherwise default loadout. Rush straight for the Teleporter, activate it, then immediately use Ion Surge to climb higher and higher into the air. Once the player is sufficiently high, it is unlikely that any enemy can reach them, allowing them to throw {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb|survivorName=|altText=Charged Nano-Bombs}} at the boss until it dies. This does not work very well against {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Stone Titan|altText=Stone Titans}} due to their hitscan laser attack, but should work against {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Wandering Vagrant|altText=Wandering Vagrants}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Queen|altText=Beetle Queens}}.
**Similarly, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|survivorName=|altUrl=Captain#OGM-72_.27DIABLO.27_Strike}} can instantly defeat a boss with Glass enabled, although the player will need to survive long enough for the strike to occur.
* Another good strategy is to enable the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} and {{ArtifactLink|Command}}. Find an Equipment Barrel and choose {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}}. Rush straight to the teleporter afterwards and use the Tricorn to instantly kill the boss and complete the challenge.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

It increases ''all'' the holder's [[damage]] by 20% (''+20% per stack''). However, when the holder takes damage that brings them below 25% of their [[Health|maximum health]], the Delicate Watch will break, replacing all stacks with {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch (Broken)}}. Broken Watches have no effect and cannot be [[Scrapper|scrapped]].

== Notes ==
* While the player is holding this item, a faint black line will appear over the health bar at the 25% mark, indicating when this item will break.
* Despite the item description specifying that watch will break below 25% {{Color|health|health}}, it is actually based on {{Color|healing|combined health}} (i.e. health plus [[Health#Shield|shields]]), similar to the {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}. This allows the item and its drawback to function normally even for a character with more than three times as much shield as health, such as one holding a {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}.
* When falling below 25% health, the {{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}}'s effect has priority triggering, followed by the {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}}'s. Only when the Unstable Transmitter is on cooldown and all Power Elixirs are used will the Delicate Watch's effect trigger.

== Tips == 
* Having an {{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} and/or a {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}} can help prevent Delicate Watches from breaking when falling below 25% health, as their effects take priority over its own.
* The Delicate Watch acts similiarly to {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}} but without the distance restriction. If the player can avoid breaking them, the Delicate Watch provides a damage increase at all distances.
* Paying the second or third offering at a [[Shrine of Blood]] can break this item immediately. This can be negated with enough [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] or blocked by {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}, among other methods.

== Lore ==

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Survivors of the Void]]
*(Undocumented) Added New Item: {{PAGENAME}}
}}

== Trivia ==  
* This item's pickup quote on breaking is a reference to the common saying "A stopped clock is right twice a day".
* This item's model in the Logbook displays accurate time according to the user's computer's time. Zooming in close enough will allow you to see the large clock hand move in real time.
* The item's brand name of Patex in the log entry is most likely a reference to Patek Philippe, a famous Swiss watch brand that makes extremely expensive and, for the most part, delicate watches.

The '''Developer Console''' is a UI window which provides a history of the most recent event logs and also allows the player to issue commands or toggle some setting variables.

It is disabled by default, but can be enabled on PC by pressing: 
* &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Alt + `&lt;/code&gt; for US/UK keyboards
*&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Alt + Ö&lt;/code&gt; for German keyboard
*&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Alt + Ñ&lt;/code&gt; for Spanish keyboard
*&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Alt + ò&lt;/code&gt; for Italian keyboard
*&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Alt + ù&lt;/code&gt; for French keyboard

After enabling, pressing the relevant key, e.g., &lt;code&gt;`&lt;/code&gt;, will toggle the window.

Console platforms can access the console using an external keyboard.

Each command/variable may have various flags dictating in what context it can be used: 
*None: no restrictions.
*ExecuteOnServer: the command will be executed by the game host, regardless of who invokes it. This is important for networking/syncing issues and may affect the output of the command, as the caller will be the host and not whoever issued the command.
*SenderMustBeServer: the command will be executed only if issued by the host.
*Archive: this saves the value of the variable in &lt;code&gt;/Config/config.cfg&lt;/code&gt; in the Risk of Rain 2 data folder, from where it can be loaded next time.
*Cheat: cheats must be enabled.
*Engine: sets the current value to the default value. Only relevant for some internal mechanism.

Some useful commands are:
*&lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt;: see a full list of commands.
**&lt;code&gt;help {command_name}&lt;/code&gt;: print the description of the specified command.
*&lt;code&gt;find {substring}&lt;/code&gt;: find all commands matching the substring.
*&lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt;: clear the console output.
*&lt;code&gt;max_messages&lt;/code&gt;: increase the max lines of console log in case some output exceeds it and is effectively cropped.

[[Modding|Mods]] can also add their own commands.

==Notes==  
*As of version 1.3.2 various commands that dump information to the console, e.g., &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;, do not print anything. This is expected to be fixed eventually as the developers are aware of this.
* The &lt;code&gt;cheats&lt;/code&gt; variable does not internally update its value and is therefore permanently stuck to disabled. [https://github.com/harbingerofme/DebugToolkit DebugToolkit] is a mod which overrides the query for the variable value, effectively unlocking all commands.
*Even though &lt;code&gt;set_scene&lt;/code&gt; has no flags, it does internally check if cheats are enabled to proceed.
*&lt;code&gt;ai_update_interval&lt;/code&gt; refers to the minimum duration before the [[Enemy AI]] chooses a new behavior.
*&lt;code&gt;ai_draw_path&lt;/code&gt; can give an insight into the pathing taken by an entity controlled by [[Enemy AI|AI]]. The "CharacterMaster selector" can either be "me" or "nearest", but the former is pointless as the player is not controlled by AI. While the next argument is supposed to enable or disable the path drawing, the command actually ignores its value and simply toggles the setting for the selected target. However, the argument still needs to be provided.
*The arguments of &lt;code&gt;debug_draw_scene_nodegraph&lt;/code&gt; are not described clearly for those without intimate knowledge of the game's internal mechanics. &lt;code&gt;shouldDraw&lt;/code&gt; takes the values {0, 1} and means whether the specified nodegraph type will be shown or hidden. The &lt;code&gt;graphType&lt;/code&gt; takes the values {0/Ground, 1/Air}, and &lt;code&gt;hullClassification&lt;/code&gt; takes the values {0/Human, 1/Golem, 2/BeetleQueen} and refers to the size of the entity the node graph can accommodate. Whatever value is chosen, it will show all nodes that have a value equal or greater than the one provided. For example, to draw all ground nodes in an Environment use the arguments &lt;code&gt;1 0 0&lt;/code&gt; and to disable them &lt;code&gt;0 0 0&lt;/code&gt;.
*&lt;code&gt;create_object_from_resources&lt;/code&gt; can spawn an object from the "Prefabs" directory, e.g., &lt;code&gt;create_object_from_resources "Prefabs/CharacterBodies/MagmaWormBody"&lt;/code&gt;. Do note that not all objects will behave properly, as in the previous example the {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}} spawns without its accompanied AI object and will therefore not go after the player. Any object that has no visible world model or visual effect will be invisible.
*&lt;code&gt;dump_object_info&lt;/code&gt; is a fairly useless command. It requires the Instance ID of the relevant object, which can be obtained only from fetching the relevant object with modding. The info it provides is also very minimal, compared to what one can query once the object has been fetched.
*&lt;code&gt;print_stats&lt;/code&gt; prints stats of the current run, e.g., which survivor is chosen, how long they have been alive, how many kills they have, how much damage they have taken from each enemy, etc. The output is very long but mostly superfluous, since it lists every single character (survivor and monster alike) that can be chosen. Changing &lt;code&gt;max_messages&lt;/code&gt; is necessary to see the full output and the player is advised to then &lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt; the console to avoid any lag while it is open.
*&lt;code&gt;set_vstr&lt;/code&gt; does not work. "vstr" stands for ''variable string'' and is supposed to set aliases for commands, but the code always ignores them.
*&lt;code&gt;gamemode&lt;/code&gt; can take the following inputs: ClassicRun, WeeklyRun, EclipseRun, and InfiniteTowerRun. The value is set accordingly when the player enters the respective game mode lobby and can effectively be overriden after entering the lobby and before starting the run. There are some game-breaking sequences involved here. For example, if the player enters a normal run lobby and then sets the gamemode to WeeklyRun, the run will behave like a [[Alternate Game Modes#Prismatic Trials|Prismatic Trials]] run, but since the [[Artifacts]] are only selected when entering the lobby, there will be none. Similarly, entering the [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse]] lobby and then setting the gamemode to InfiniteTowerRun, will result to a [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] run with the Eclipse difficulty of the selected survivor, since the selected "difficulty" is locked in when entering the lobby.
*&lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt; can be used to compile a list of settings in a .cfg file for quick execution, but can also be used for a set of commands that the player may wish to invoke during a run repeatedly.
*&lt;code&gt;graphy_fps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;graphy_specs&lt;/code&gt; toggle visual information about the machine's performance and specs respectively, however, &lt;code&gt;graphy_init&lt;/code&gt; must be called first for them to work.
*Some commands which are related to testing during development, i.e., &lt;code&gt;activate_teleporter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;enemies_are_gods&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reloadStage&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;override_run_seed&lt;/code&gt;, most likely do not have the Cheat flag by oversight.

      <text bytes="13370" sha1="am2g0glj1gjyb2agsvqc1d41ymjinuj" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' in Risk of Rain 2 can refer to two things: '''initial difficulty''' and '''scaling difficulty'''.

== Initial Difficulty ==
[[File:Difficulties.jpg|thumb|The difficulty selection widget]]
'''Initial difficulty''' in Risk of Rain 2 is selected along with the players' [[Survivors]] and loadouts before starting a run. The three initial difficulties are Drizzle, Rainstorm and Monsoon.

=== [[File:Drizzle.png|32px]] Drizzle ===
{{Quote|Reduces difficulty for players new to the game. Weeping and gnashing is replaced by laughter and tickles.|In-game description}}
'''Drizzle''' is an easier initial difficulty designed for a more relaxing experience.

* Time affects scaling difficulty at 50% the normal pace.
* Players have a +70 bonus to [[armor]].
* Players' health regeneration multiplier starts at &lt;code&gt;1.5&lt;/code&gt;.

=== [[File:Rainstorm.png|32px]] Rainstorm ===
{{Quote|This is the way the game is meant to be played! Test your abilities and skills against formidable foes.|In-game description}}
'''Rainstorm''' is the default initial difficulty of the game.

=== [[File:Monsoon.png|32px]] Monsoon ===
{{Quote|For hardcore players. Every bend introduces pain and horrors of the planet. You will die.|In-game description}}
'''Monsoon''' is the hardest initial difficulty designed for players who seek a challenge.

* Time affects scaling difficulty at 150% of the normal pace.
* Players' health regeneration multiplier starts at &lt;code&gt;0.6&lt;/code&gt;.
* The [[Deicide]] and [[The Calm]] challenges can only be obtained on this difficulty.
* The mastery challenges for [[Survivors|Survivors']] alternate skins can only be obtained on this difficulty.

=== [[File:Eclipse.png|32x32px]] Eclipse ===
'''Eclipse''' is an alternate gamemode that adds stacking challenge modifiers to successive runs to create difficulties "beyond" Monsoon. For more information, see the [[Eclipse]] page.

== Scaling Difficulty ==
[[File:Bar.jpg|thumb|The difficulty indicator]]
[[File:MonsterLevelHUD.png|thumb|The "Lv. X" label on the difficulty visual displays the current difficulty sublevel, NOT related to the player's level. This is the level which determines monster stats.]]
'''Scaling difficulty''' is a core mechanic of Risk of Rain 2. As a run progresses, the difficulty will steadily rise, making enemies both stronger and more numerous.

The steadily rising difficulty is represented in-game through a bar in the top right corner of the screen. This bar shows the selected initial difficulty, the current run timer and the current status of the scaling difficulty. As the bar progresses, it will pass through multiple named sub-difficulties in order:

* Easy
* Normal
* Hard
* Very Hard
* Insane
* Impossible
* I SEE YOU
* I'M COMING FOR YOU
* HAHAHAHA

The HAHAHAHA sub-difficulty has a maximum of level 99.

In addition to the increase over time, every time an [[Environments|environment]] is completed (aside the [[Bazaar Between Time]]), the difficulty will jump forward, which will cause a spike in difficulty, and the bar will also increase faster. This increase is exponential, which means that as more [[Environments#Looping|Loops]] are completed, the game becomes exponentially harder.

The game files mention a "Very Easy" difficulty, although it is never seen during normal gameplay.

=== Effects of difficulty ===
Each of these sub-difficulties contain two intermediate "notches". Every time a "notch" is reached, or the next sub-difficulty is reached, enemies will level up, which is indicated by a visual effect and a level-up sound similar to a player level-up, although with a lower pitch. Just like players, enemies gain 30% [[health]] and 20% [[damage]] (compared to their base values shown in the Logbook) per additional level.

In addition to enemy levels, the difficulty also affects the spawn rate of enemies. As the sub-difficulties progress, enemies will spawn faster and in greater numbers. After a while, stronger enemies will start to spawn outside of the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], including mini-bosses (such as {{MonsterLink|Greater Wisp|Greater Wisps}}) and Teleporter Bosses (such as {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|Stone Titans}}). Higher difficulty also increases the frequency of [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]]s, and even allows for elite mini-bosses and Teleporter Bosses.

The final effect of difficulty is the cost of interactables. When reaching a new environment, the cost of [[Chests]], [[Shrine of Chance|Shrines of Chance]], {{EntityLink|Gunner Turret|Turrets}}, etc. is calculated relative to the difficulty.

=== Multiplayer ===
The core mechanics of scaling difficulty do not change in multiplayer, but two numerical changes are applied:
* The initial difficulty is higher, although this is not reflected on the bar. This is why the spawn rate is higher and chests are more expensive. Enemies still start at level 1, however.
* Time has a greater effect on scaling difficulty (the bar advances faster). This is reflected on the bar, although the effect is subtle for a low player count.
Unlike the first game, playing multiplayer solo (starting a server but not waiting for other players) will '''not '''change the scaling compared to "true" singleplayer.

== The Math of Scaling Difficulty ==
The effect of difficulty on the game is centralized in a global number called the '''difficulty coefficient''' (''coeff'' for short). This coefficient is constantly re-evaluated and it is calculated as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{playerFactor} = 0.7 + 0.3 \times (\mathrm{playerCount})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{timeFactor} = 0.0506 \times \mathrm{difficultyValue} \times \mathrm{playerCount}^{0.2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{stageFactor} = 1.15^{\mathrm{stagesCompleted}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{coeff} = (\mathrm{playerFactor} + \mathrm{timeInMinutes} \times \mathrm{timeFactor}) \times \mathrm{stageFactor}&lt;/math&gt;

In these formulas, the variable

* playerCount is equal to the number of players in the game (including disconnected players).
* difficultyValue is equal to 1 for Drizzle, 2 for Rainstorm, and 3 for Monsoon.
* stagesCompleted is equal to the number of stages completed (except for [[A Moment, Fractured]], [[Gilded Coast]], [[Bazaar Between Time]] or [[Void Fields]], these stages will not increase this counter when they are left). This is the same number that shows up in the statistics screen at the end of the run and can be summarized as the stage number displayed at the top right of the run minus one.
* timeInMinutes is the amount of minutes since the run started, incremented every second.

Therefore, in non-modded lobbies, ''coeff'' will start at an initial value of 1 to 1.9 depending on the number of players. The bar will then progress linearly as time increases, increasing faster depending on the initial difficulty and/or the player count. Every time players enter a new environment, ''coeff'' increases by 15% of its current value, which causes the jump on the bar.

It is interesting to note that although sub-difficulties do not have any tangible effect on gameplay, they do signal an increase of ''coeff'' by 1 (actually 0.99 but by the time the difference becomes significant, the sub-difficulty is already in its final stage). For example, in singleplayer the '''Easy''' sub-difficulty represents a range for ''coeff'' from 1 to 2, while '''Medium '''is 2 to 3, etc.

=== Effect on enemy level ===
The enemy level is calculated using this formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{enemyLevel} = 1 + (\mathrm{coeff} - \mathrm{playerFactor}) / 0.33&lt;/math&gt;

No matter the number of players or difficulty, this means that enemies always start at level 1. As ''coeff'' rises, however, so too do enemy levels. The faster ''coeff'' increases, the more the effect becomes pronounced - especially when [[Environments#Looping|Looping]] - as the exponential rise in ''coeff'' is translated to enemy levels and therefore stats.

=== Effect on money costs ===
Whenever an environment starts, the cost of an interactable is derived from the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{moneyCost }= \mathrm{baseCost} \times \mathrm{coeff}^{1.25}&lt;/math&gt;

The base cost is equal to what the interactable would cost in the first environment of a singleplayer run (for instance, the base value of a [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]] is $25). Since ''coeff'' starts at a higher value in multiplayer, chests are also equally more expensive.

=== Effect on enemy rewards ===
Whenever a [[Monsters|monster]] spawns, its reward is directly multiplied by ''coeff'' :

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{rewardCoefficient} = max(1, \lfloor \mathrm{monsterValue} \times \mathrm{expRewardCoefficient} \rfloor)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{enemyXPReward} = max(1, \lfloor \mathrm{coeff} \times \mathrm{rewardCoefficient} \rfloor)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{enemyGoldReward} = max(1, \lfloor 2 \times \mathrm{coeff} \times \mathrm{rewardCoefficient} \times \mathrm{goldRewardCoefficient} \rfloor)&lt;/math&gt;

''See [[Directors]] for more information on monster value and reward multipliers.''

=== Effect on spawn rate ===
Spawns are managed by the [[Directors]], which are advanced systems that are responsible for spawning a variety of enemies matching the difficulty. 

Over time, a Director accumulates a number of "credits" that increase linearly with ''coeff''. Regularly, the Director will pick a random enemy to spawn depending on the environment spawn lists and spend credits to spawn a group of up to four. Weaker enemies such as {{MonsterLink|Lemurian|Lemurians}} have a low cost, while bosses like {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm|Magma Worms}} have the highest. Additionally, spawning [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] monsters is more costly: Blazing, Overloading, and Glacial Elites cost 6 times as much as a normal monster, and Malachite and Celestine Elites cost a whopping 36 times as much.

While ''coeff'' is low, a Director will only spawn lone, weak enemies. As ''coeff'' rises, however, so does the Director's budget. This allows it to spawn larger groups of enemies, stronger enemies, more [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]]s, or more expensive enemies.

A Director will also avoid spawning an enemy group that is "too cheap" for its current credit (defined as the cost of a full pack of elites, so either 36 or 216 times the original enemy cost depending on the current stage). This is why as time goes on, weaker enemies are less and less common and even disappear completely after a while. In previous versions, this meant that for particularly deep runs, ''coeff'' became so large that even ''bosses'' became too cheap, which caused strange behavior such as Teleporter Bosses failing to spawn. Eventually, stages would be completely empty as ''coeff'' reached into the thousands and the Directors endlessly accumulated credits they refused to spend.  Now, to ensure that the Directors always have something to populate the map with, they will check if the selected monster group is not the most expensive they could spawn before they deem them too cheap to use.

===Unique scaling===
The [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Bosses]], excluding the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}, have a unique scaling to their HP and damage stats which boosts them beyond their level formulas. This means these enemies will remain competitive even after reaching their level 99 cap, as the ''coeff'' keeps growing. These scaling formulas are as follow:

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{enemyHP} = \mathrm{enemyHP} \times \mathop{\mathrm{round}}((1 + \mathrm{coeff} / 2.5) \times \sqrt{\mathrm{livingPlayers}} \times 10) / 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{enemyDamage} = \mathrm{enemyDamage} \times \mathop{\mathrm{round}}((1 + \mathrm{coeff} / 30) \times 10) / 10&lt;/math&gt;

'''Dio's Best Friend''' is a [[Ror:Dio's Best Friend|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

Upon dying, the holder will be revived after a few seconds. This will trigger any on-death effects, such as the ice explosions from [[Monsters#Glacial|Glacial Elites]]. Upon reviving, the holder gets 3 seconds of {{StatusEffectLink|Immune|invincibility}}, and the item is consumed.

== Notes ==
* The {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Extra Life|altText=revive}} from the [[Shrine of Shaping]] takes precedence over {{ItemLink|Seed of Life}}, which itself takes precedence over Dio's Best Friend and {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}}.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets can be revived by this item. Redeploying gives them a new, unused Dio's Best Friend (as long as Engineer's is unused).
* While activating the final cell event in the [[Void Fields]], it is possible for enemies to receive Dio's Best Friend as a Legendary item. Players should be careful if this happens, since each enemy will be revived after death once with invulnerability. They can even be revived from death when the completion of the cell event kills all enemies.
* Revived enemies can drop items if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled, making it a good way to farm items in the Void Fields.
* If the {{ArtifactLink|Metamorphosis}} is enabled, the player will revive as a new survivor.
* The item's invulnerability does ''not'' protect the player from being instantly killed by the Nullifier Implosion from a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}}, {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer}}, {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}, and the {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}.
** Voidling's Nullifier kills on contact, rather than through a single implosion attack. Invulnerability from this item will be bypassed, effectively killing the player repeatedly through multiple revives.

== Trivia ==
* The name Dio is a reference to Duncan Drummond's cat. He is one of the developers of Risk of Rain. This can be found under the "Team Section" on the [https://riskofraingame.com/team/ official site].
** In Risk of Rain 1, the achievement to unlock this item is known as "Sole Survivor". This is a reference to a lyric in the song 'Holy Diver' by Dio, the artist from which Duncan's cat gets its name.
** The logbook for this item, added in the Anniversary Update, is also written from his perspective as a letter to his cat.
* Before the Skills 2.0 update, using a [[Shrine of Order]] made all consumed Friends disappear due to not having an item tier. Now, it simply leaves them alone.
&lt;!-- I swear to god if I see any more jojoposters--&gt;
&lt;!-- https://twitter.com/the_hopoo/status/1285624364730327040 it isn't a reference to JoJo, but I do find it funny how it warranted a response. Probably worth mentioning. I'm not doing it though. --&gt;

      <text bytes="57859" sha1="iq1senp2j9onos1j8yfap2smxlxw2yw" xml:space="preserve">As a rogue-like game, ''Risk of Rain 2'' features a lot of random generation as part of its gameplay - unlike many other action games, enemies and most items are randomized between different runs, both in their nature and location. The systems that manage these are called the '''Directors'''. Their main purpose is to manage spawning of [[monsters]] and [[interactables]] while keeping a balance between variety and consistency to ensure a fun experience and ever-different playthroughs.

Risk of Rain 2 uses three sets of Directors: The '''Scene Director''', which is responsible for setting up the map when entering an Environment; the '''Camp Director''', which is similar to the Scene Director and is responsible for setting up a [[Void Seed]] when it spawns; and the '''Combat Directors''', which are responsible for spawning enemies while players explore the map.

==Basics and Terminology==

Although all types of Directors work differently, they share some similar concepts. Understanding them is important to understand the finer details of their inner workings.

===List of Directors===

The game has a wide variety of Directors. Note, however, that not all of these Directors are active at the same time. Directors are classified into ''Instantaneous'' and ''Continuous'' Directors. Only active Directors can spawn monsters and interactables.

====Instantaneous====

Instantaneous Directors have simple behavior: once activated, they perform their spawns, then immediately disable themselves once more.  

*The ''Scene Director'' is active only during map setup, before the players arrive. It is responsible for spawning all interactables, as well as the initial monsters present on the map when players teleport in.
*The ''Camp Director'' is active only during map setup when a [[Void Seed]] spawns. It is responsible for spawning all interactables and monsters related to it when players teleport in.
*The ''Teleporter Boss Director'' is activated 3 seconds after players activate the [[Teleporter]]. It is responsible for spawning [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Bosses]].
*The ''Shrine of Combat Director'' is activated whenever a player activates a [[Shrine of Combat]]. It is responsible for spawning the monsters that appear from the Shrine.
*The ''Defiant Gouge Director'' is activated whenever a player activates a [[Interactables#Shrines|Shrine]] while in the possession of a {{ItemLink|itemName=Defiant Gouge}}. It is responsible for spawning monsters according to the item's behaviour.
*The ''Battery Director'' is activated whenever a player activates a Pillar on {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} or a Deep Void Signal on {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}. It is responsible for spawning a single big wave of enemies during the holdout event.
*The ''Halcyon Shrine Director'' is activated both when the player activates the [[Halcyon Shrine]] and also when it has drained enough gold to transition reward tiers. At each point it uses all its available credits to spawn a wave of {{EntityLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golems}}.
*The ''Halcyonite Director'' is activated when the player interacts with the Halcyon Shrine a second time or it has fully drained the required amount of gold. It is responsible for spawning the {{StatusEffectLink|Gilded}} {{MonsterLink|Halcyonite}}.

====Continuous====

Continuous Directors activate and deactivate themselves based on various conditions. While active, these Directors will regularly receive "credits" and attempt spawns until they are disabled.  

*The two ''Standard Directors'' activate when players enter the map, and deactivate 3 seconds after players activate the Teleporter. They are responsible for spawning most of the monsters players will encounter when exploring the map. Both Directors have very similar characteristics, but they differ in their spawn rates. They will be called the ''Fast'' and ''Slow'' Directors in the rest of the article.
*The ''Teleporter Director'' activates 3 seconds after players activate the Teleporter and deactivates when the Teleporter is fully charged. It is responsible for spawning monsters while the Teleporter is charging.
*The ''Arena Director'' activates whenever a player activates a cell in the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} and deactivates when the holdout event finishes. There can be up to 4 Directors active, one for each unique monster.
*The two ''Mithrix Directors'' activative at the beginning of the second and third phases of the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} fight respectively and deactivate when their respective phase is over. They are responsible for spawning monsters during the boss fight.
*The two ''Escape Sequence Directors'' are active during the escape sequence on Commencement. They are responsible for spawning {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}} and {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} Chimeras respectively.
*The ''Voidling Director'' is active during any Simulated Environment on {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}. It is responsible for spawning monsters during the fight with the {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}.
*The ''Simulacrum Director'' activates when any Simulacrum wave commences and deactives when it finishes. It is responsible for spawning all monsters for the wave.
*The ''False Son Director'' activates during the second phase of the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} fight and it is responsible for spawning Stone Golems.

===Director Credits===

Just as players use money to purchase items, the Directors make use of a special, invisible currency called "credits". Instantaneous Directors gain a burst of credits when activated, which they immediately spend. On the other hand, Continuous Directors accumulate and spend credits over time while they are active. The number of credits received depends on the Director itself, though all Directors use the same costs to spawn entities.

===Spawn Cards===

In order to determine what to spawn and at which frequencies, the Directors make use of a concept called Spawn Cards. A Spawn Card represents a single entity and has a ''Weight'', a ''Credit Cost'' and a ''Stage Condition''. Every monster and non-static interactable in the game has a spawn card. 

*The ''Entity'' represents what will be spawned if the card is selected.
* The ''Weight'' represents the relative chance of the card to be selected.
*The ''Credit Cost'' represents how many credits a Director must spend to spawn the entity listed on the card.
*The ''Stage Condition'' represent the earliest stage this card can be selected.

====Categories====

All spawn cards belong to one of several ''Categories'', which are simply a collection of spawn cards with a weight. Every map uses the same set of categories, but the weight of the categories themselves varies depending on the map, and not all maps use all spawn cards. Some maps can also override the weight or cost of individual spawn cards, although this is rare. Note the Scene Director is not given any credits to spawn interactables on {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}, {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured}}, {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}}, {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}, which are omitted from the table. The spawns from the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}} are also omitted to further simplify the table, since they are only the [[Void Cradle]], [[Void Potential]], and [[Stalk]] with equal chances.

The monster spawn card data only include the location where they are normally encountered. This does not include [[Family Events]] and the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}}, which override these spawn card categories. Since these overrides are fixed, regardless of Environment, they are summarised in their respective pages.

====Weighting====
Whenever a Director picks a spawn card, it does not do so completely randomly - it takes into account the computed weight of the element. The computed weight of the element depends on two things:   

*The relative weight of the category (equal to the weight of the category, divided by the sum of the weights of all categories)
*The relative weight of the card (equal to the weight of the element, divided by the sum of the weights of all elements '''that can spawn on this map''' and '''within that category''')

The final chance to be picked is equal to the product of these ratios.

Think of it like a lottery. First, every category puts in tickets equal to their weight (a category with a weight of 10 has 5 times more tickets than a category with a weight of 2). Then, a random ticket is picked to select a category. The same thing then happens within the category: every item puts in tickets equal to its weight, and then a random ticket is drawn to determine which spawn card is selected from that category.

==The Scene Director==

When activated during the start of a stage, the Scene Director spawns everything at once. Once it has selected "reserved" spots for the Teleporter and player spawns, it starts populating the map with interactables, then monsters. Finally, during cleanup, if at least one player has a {{ItemLink|Rusted Key}}, an {{ItemLink|Encrusted Key}}, or a {{ItemLink|Shipping Request Form}}, it will spawn the relevant items for each player who has them in their inventory. The items within the Lockboxes are determined when they spawn.

===Credit Income===

The Scene Director holds 2 credit budgets, one for its interactables and one for its monsters. The base amount of credits given to the Scene Director when the stage starts depends on the environment.

The amount of interactable credits is then increased by +50% per additional player beyond the first. For instance, on Abyssal Depths, the Scene Director will hold 400 credits in singleplayer, 600 with 2 players, 800 with 3, and a whopping 1000 with 4. This total represents how much the Scene Director will have to work with. This effectively means that singleplayer is "easier" than multiplayer, because if the loot is shared evenly even for two players, they will each obtain 75% of the amount of items than they would in singleplayer.

Note that whenever the "vault" of [[Abyssal Depths]] is open, the Scene Director is granted 160 additional interactable credits. These credits are ''not'' increased by player count, however, and this does not apply to the "vault" of [[Distant Roost]] either.

The amount of monster credits is ''not'' increased by player count, but rather multiplied by the [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]]. For instance, entering Abandoned Aqueduct with 2 players at the start of "Medium" (which is a coefficient of 2.3) will give the Scene Director 230 monster credits to work with. The only exception to this rule is the first stage, which always starts with the base amount of monster credits.

The tables for the credit and spawn card categories for both interactables and monsters are summarised as follows:

=== Spawning Interactables===

When spawning interactables, the Scene Director will repeatedly select a spawn card from its deck, ''only selecting between cards it can currently afford.'' It then pays for it, attempts to spawn it and starts again. The process is interrupted only if one of 2 conditions are met :

*The Scene Director's credit count reaches 0 or less.
*The Scene Director has no interactable it can afford.

Because there is no hard limit to the number of possible spawns, this means that almost all maps will hold at least one [[Barrel]] or [[Chests#Equipment Barrel|Equipment Barrel]], since these interactables have a cost of 1 and a rather high weight. It is likely they'll be selected a few times when the Scene Director has few credits remaining (less than 10).

===Spawning Monsters===

When spawning monsters, the Scene Director will use the same routine as when spawning interactables, with one main difference: a limit of 40 monsters. When this limit is reached, the Scene Director will discard its remaining credits and finish its setup. Monsters spawned this way do not use any of the checks used by the Combat Directors - they can never be too cheap, although they will always be valid and within the budget.

Monsters spawned by the Scene Director use their own reward coefficient of 0.0667, which is one-third of what an equivalent monster would give before the Teleporter Event. Details on how monster rewards are calculated are given in the Combat Director section.

== The Camp Director ==

The Camp Director is similar to the Scene Director, in that it spawns the interactables and monsters for the Void Seed area. The main difference is that the Void Seed comes with two flavors of Camp Directors:
*one to spawn interactables and {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monsters, and
*one to spawn decorative kelp (non-interactable) and Voidtouched elites from the Environment's pool of monsters.

|60
|-

|}
Each Camp Director will deduct half of its monster credits from the Scene Director (rounded up). This is so that spawning a Void Seed does not result in highly populated stages, even though they will still be more densely populated than without a Void Seed. Since up to 3 Void Seeds can spawn in a stage, any Environment whose Scene Director has fewer than 180 monster credits makes it possible, however unlikely, to not have any credits left for monster spawning itself.

==The Combat Directors ==

The Combat Directors are responsible for spawning every monster that is not initially spawned by the Scene Director.

===Attributes===

Every Combat Director has different attributes. They are summarized in the following tables. These attributes are referenced later.

Note that the Scene and Camp Directors are only included for when they spawn monsters, but they are not actually Combat Directors.

===Credit Income===

====Instantaneous Directors ====

Instantaneous Directors receive a burst of credits when they are activated. The amount is specified on the "Credits on activation" row. Once they've spawned their wave, they immediately deactivate.

==== Continuous Directors====

Continuous Directors may or may not start with some initial credits and they have a credit generator attached. Every second, the generator grants some credits to its Director. The number of credits generated every second can be found with the formula:

&lt;math&gt;creditsPerSecond = creditMultiplier \times (1 + 0.4 \times coeff) \times (playerCount + 1) / 2&lt;/math&gt;

Where:  
*''creditMultiplier'' is the "credit multiplier" attribute of the Director
*''playerCount'' refers to the number of players in the game
*''coeff'' represents the current difficulty coefficient
The Arena Director is an exception as its credit and credit multiplier values are calculated at the beginning of each cell holdout event and are meant to smoothly increase between round. For each Active Director, they are calculated as follow:

&lt;math&gt;credits = (baseCredits + creditMultiplierPerRound * (currentRound - 1) * coeff) / activeDirectors&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;creditMultiplier = creditMultiplierPerRound * currentRound / activeDirectors&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''baseCredits'' is the credits the Director starts with
*''creditMultiplierPerRound'' is the base credit multiplier with a value of 0.15
*''currentRound'' is the current round, starting at 1
*''activeDirectors'' is the number of unique monsters, starting at 1 and increased by 1 at each odd round count

====Director transfer====

Whenever a Combat Director deactivates, it transfers 40% of its remaining credits to another random active Director and discards the rest. If there are no other active Directors (such as when the Teleporter has been charged), these credits are lost.

When activating the Teleporter, the Teleporter Directors activate before the standard Directors deactivate, so they receive some credits from the deactivating Directors. Which Director receives which one's credits is random, however.

===Monster &amp; Elite tiers===

Most monsters in the game can spawn in multiple variations of power level, called Tiers. Tier 0 monsters are the base version of the monster, while Tier 1 and higher have higher attributes and unique abilities - these monsters are called [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] monsters. Their HP bar outline is white instead of grey, and they also have an "Elite item" granting them the abilities of their affix.

Elite monsters have a higher credit value than their normal counterparts. The value of a monster is equal to its base value multiplied by the value multiplier of its elite tier (e.g. a T0 Jellyfish is worth 10, a T1 Jellyfish is worth 60, and a T2 Jelllyfish is worth 360). 

Some Elite tiers are not available until a certain number of stages have been completed. Whenever it is calculated, the maximum value of an Elite monster only takes into account the available tiers (e.g. the highest possible value for a Jellyfish is 60 in stages 1-5 and 360 from stage 6 onwards).

Similarly, some monsters can never be Elite - the maximum tier for them is always considered 0, regardless of the current stage. This currently only affects the {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}} and {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}.

===Card pre-selection===

Before entering the spawn loop, some Directors prepare cards in a specific way, allowing them to match specific conditions the standard selection method may not match.

This is only applied to the first card, so if the first spawn fails, the second one will '''not''' use these mechanics again.

====Shrine of Combat ====

When the Shrine of Combat Director picks its card, it does so in a way that will guarantee that it will work. As such, the Shrine of Combat Director only picks from cards that match the following conditions: 

*The card is valid.
*The card's value is lower than the Shrine of Combat Director's credits.
*The Shrine of Combat Director's credits are lower than the "too cheap" value for the card (see the next section for details).

If at least one card matches all these conditions, the Director picks one at random and uses it.

If no card matches all these conditions, the shrine deactivates, spawning in an inactive state as if already used.

Note that since these conditions mimic those used by the spawn loop, the Combat Shrine Director should eventually succeed when it actually attempts the spawn even if the enemy limit has been reached at the time of each activation.

The Defiant Gouge Director works in exactly the same way.

====Teleporter Boss====

The Teleporter Boss Director picks its first card only from the Champions category, but it makes no check whether the spawn will fail due to the card being too cheap or too expensive. If this is the case, or no Champion spawn cards are found (due to a [[Family Events|Family Event]] or the {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} being enabled), the Director will select '''any''' monster card from those available for the Environment until one of appropriate cost is found. Note, that it is possible to end up selecting another Champion monster as a result of this.

If the selected monster is not from the Champion category, the boss fight will be what is known as a ''Horde of Many'' event, but there is nothing special about this in the underlying mechanics. Every monster has a Health Bar subtitle message when it is selected for the boss fight, and while the Champion monsters, the {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} and the {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} Chimeras all have unique messages, every other monster defaults to "Horde of Many".

In the early game Horde of Many is generally only possible where the {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}} and {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}} are available, because their initial costs and their lack of Elite Tiers make them fairly likely to being either too cheap or too expensive. But in a very late run even Champion monsters will be deemed too cheap and only Scavengers will spawn.

Due to the initial spawn card being rerolled only if the selected monster is too cheap or expensive, this makes tracking the chances of a Horde of Many very complicated. For example, on {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}} if the Director has less than 4000 credits, picking the Overloading Worm will cause it to be rerolled. The chances of picking a normal monster then depends exactly on how many credits the Director has. Between 4000 and 4800 credits no Champion monster will fail to spawn. Between 4801 and 5400 credits the Magma Worm will be rerolled, but the only remaining non-Champion monster affordable is a {{MonsterLink|Gup}}. From 5401 credits and above, even though the Magma Worm will still fail, only the remaining Champion monsters are within the credit conditions. These numbers change once again after looping, as the availability of {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}} and T2 Elites change the credit thresholds for rerolling.

Be mindful that in the above example if the Director starts with, for example, 4700 credits, the deactivated Fast/Slow Directors may donate it enough credits to push it over the 4800 threshold which can lead to a Horde of Many.

If the Director fails to spawn a monster due to the location chosen, e.g., inside a wall, the spawning process will end prematurely. So, if, for example, the Director has enough credits to spawn 3 monsters, but the second one fails, only the first one will spawn. In the special case where the very first spawn fails because of this, the Director will choose another card which could lead to Horde of Many as described above, even though the initial card passed the cost conditions. This effectively makes Horde of Many possible on any Environment as early as stage 1, but it is a fairly rare phenomenon.

====Battery Director====
While there is no special selection criteria for this Director, due to the fixed amount of credits and the small monster pool, it is possible to list all possible spawn encounters.

For {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}:

* 60%: 2 {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)|Lunar Chimera (Golems)}}
*20%: 3 {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Exploder)|Lunar Chimera (Exploders)}} (1 of which will be Perfected Elite)
*20%: 1 {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}}

For the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}: 
* 40%: 1 {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer}} 
*30%: 2 {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}}
* 30%: 4 {{MonsterLink|Void Barnacle|Void Barnacles}} (2 of which will be T1 Elites)
Notably, on Void Locus the Battery Director behaves like a Teleporter Boss Director and will attempt to select a Champion spawn card first. This is guaranteed to fail because the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Devastator}} costs 800 credits. However, with the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} enabled, it is possible for affordable Champion spawn cards to be in the monster pool, which can make the encounter more biased towards Champion monster spawns.

===Spawn loop===

While active, all Combat Directors, both instantaneous and continuous, will periodically attempt to spawn a monster. A spawn loop runs every frame and follows the following steps.

====Pick a target====

If the Director targets players, it selects one random living player as its target. When a player has been selected, the Director also sets a "retarget timer," which is a random value between 1 and 10 seconds. At the end of that timer, it will pick a random living player again as its next target (which may be the same player as the previous one).

Directors that target an object will never switch to something else.

The Director uses the target to determine where the enemy will appear. All enemies have a minimum and maximum distance value, dictating how close or far they can be from their target when they spawn.

====Check the timer====

If the monster spawn timer is at 0 or less, the Director will attempt a spawn.

When they activate, all Directors start with a spawn timer of 0, which means they can immediately attempt a spawn. The Teleporter Boss Director starts with a spawn timer of -600, so it will virtually never ''not'' attempt a spawn.

====Attempt a spawn====

===== Check for overcrowding=====

If there are already 40 monsters or more on the map, the spawn will FAIL. The Teleporter Boss bypasses this restriction, however.

=====Prepare a wave=====

If the previous spawn was a SUCCESS, the wave parameters are kept and this section is ''skipped''.

If the Director has pre-selected a monster card and no spawn has FAILED yet, it prepares the wave using that card.

If the Director has ''not'' pre-selected a card, or the last spawn attempt was a FAIL, a random monster card is selected.

The Director then determines which Elite tier will be active. The chosen Elite tier is the highest available tier the Director can afford (as in, the value of the corresponding Elite monster is less than or equal to the Director's current credits). Once the tier has been chosen, a random affix is then picked from its tier (unless the chosen tier is 0). All Elites from the wave will use this tier and affix.

Finally, a spawn counter is created, starting at 0 and tracking how many monsters have been spawned with the current parameters.

=====Check the spawn card=====

The Director checks that the current card is valid for the spawn. It checks the 4 following conditions:

*The current wave has spawned 5 or less monsters.
* The spawn card conditions are met (i.e. if a Hermit Crab was selected, the stage must be 2nd or higher).
*The Director can afford the monster (i.e. its spawn cost is equal to or lower than the Director's current credits).
*The monster is not too cheap for the Director (see below for details).

If all conditions are met, the spawn will SUCCEED and the Director starts preparing the spawn - otherwise, it FAILS and the Director skips the spawn. Note that no credits are spent if the spawn is a FAILURE.

======Too cheap?======

A monster is deemed too cheap for the Director if all three of these conditions are met:    

*The amount of credits the Director has is more than 6 times the value of an Elite of the selected Tier.
*The Director is not an Instantaneous Director.
*The selected monster is not the most expensive the Director could spawn (defined as the highest value out of all monsters of the maximum available Tier)

The third condition ensures that Directors will always have at least one possible enemy to spawn. (Before build 3830295, the Director could gain so many credits that it considered every single monster in the game too cheap, and therefore did not spawn anything.)

===== Prepare the spawn=====

#The Director prepares the monster matching the spawn card.
#If the Director has enough credits to spawn an Elite of the selected Elite tier, it sets the monster as Elite and raises its value accordingly - otherwise, the monster will be tier 0.
#The Director pays for the monster. It spends an amount of credits equal to the monster's value and increments the wave spawn counter by 1.
#The Director calculates the HP and damage multipliers of the monster according to its Tier.
#If the monster is a Teleporter Boss, its HP multiplier is multiplied by the number of ''living'' players and it is set so that {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}} will deal bonus damage to it.
#The Director applies the HP and damage multiplier to the monster by giving it an appropriate amount of Boost items. These are invisible items that increase the monster's HP and damage.
#The Director sets the reward of the monster. They are calculated as follows : &lt;br /&gt;'''enemyXPReward = coeff * monsterValue * rewardMultiplier'''&lt;br /&gt;'''enemyGoldReward = 2 * coeff * monsterValue * rewardMultiplier'''&lt;br /&gt;where the reward multiplier is an attribute of that Director, and coeff is the difficulty coefficient.
#The Director spawns the monster.

====Check the spawn status====
What happens now depends on whether the previous spawn was a SUCCESS or a FAIL.

#If the spawn failed  
#*If the Director is an Instantaneous Director that already spawned at least one enemy, it deactivates.
#*The monster spawn timer increases by a random amount specified by the "Spawn Interval (Between waves)" attribute. This attribute is irrelevant for Instantaneous Directors, because they will either try again immediately or never succeed.
#*The current monster card is destroyed, which means another one will be prepared during the next attempt. The same card may be selected again, however.
#If the spawn succeeded
#*The monster spawn timer increases by a random amount specified by the "Spawn Interval (During a wave)" attribute.
#* The current monster card and Elite tier/affix are kept.

===Example===

Since the spawning method is rather complex, here is a concrete example to help understand the various concepts behind spawning.

Note that the Directors' spawn rates have changed as of the Skills 2.0 update. However, the same concepts still stand, so the old values will be used.

====Scenario====

4 players have just entered Abandoned Aqueduct, in their second loop. The difficulty is already past HAHAHAHA (Coeff of 17.5).

==== t = 0s | Attempt 1 : Condemned by poverty====

Both Fast and Slow Directors activate, starting with 0 credits. They immediately target Player 2, choose a retarget timer of 6s, then attempt a spawn, which fails since they have no credits. Fast decides to attempt a spawn 4.01 seconds later, while Slow chooses a delay of 18.33 seconds.

==== t = 4.01s | Attempt 2 : Now we're talking====

After 4.01 seconds, both Directors have received 4 waves of credits. Each wave contains 0.75 * (1 + 0.4 * 17.5) * (4+1) / 2 = 15 credits, so both Directors have 60 credits (we will ignore the very small increments of the difficulty coefficient every second to make calculations clearer). Fast will now try another spawn, since its monster timer has reached 0.

First, Fast keeps Player 2 as its spawn target since 1.99s remain on its retarget timer. There are only 12 monsters on the map (pre-placed by the Scene Director), so all is well. 

Since Fast's last spawn FAILED, it picks a spawn card - a Beetle, of base value 8.

Fast must then select an appropriate Elite tier. It tries Tier 1, which is always available, and finds that the value of a T1 Beetle would be 8 * 6 = 48 credits, which it can afford. It also tries Tier 2, which is available since players are in their second loop, getting a value of 8 * 36 = 288 credits, which is too much. Therefore, Tier 1 is selected.

Fast selects a random affix from the Tier 1 list. Glacial is selected. Finally, the Wave spawn counter is set to 0.

With the wave parameters set, Fast can now actually attempt a spawn.

Beetles have no special conditions, and Fast's credit count (60) is higher than 8 but lower than 288 (the cost of 6 T1 Beetles), so the spawn will SUCCEED.

Fast notices that the cost of a T1 Beetle, 48 credits, is lower than its current budget. It therefore decides to spawn the Beetle as a Tier 1 Elite, raising its value to 48.

Fast pays for the Beetle, and it has 12 credits remaining. Since the Beetle is Tier 1, its HP multiplier is set to 4.7 and its damage multiplier to 2. It is also granted the Glacial buff. Since it is not a Teleporter Boss, no further adjustments are necessary.

Fast then calculates the base reward of its shiny new Beetle. Its base XP reward will be 0.2 * 17.5 * 48 = 168 XP, and its Gold reward will be double that, 336 Gold.

Finally, the Beetle spawns, not too far away from Player 2. With its higher HP and damage, we can only hope it will be a force to be reckoned with.

Since the spawn was a SUCCESS, Fast keeps Beetles and T1/Glacial. It decides to spawn the next monster 0.45s later.

====t = 4.46s | Attempt 3 : They are billions====

Shortly after our Elite beetle starts spawning, Fast decides to spawn another monster. It has not received any credit since, so its budget is still 12.

Our poor Player 2 is still targeted for 1.54s, so no change there.

Because the last spawn SUCCEEDED, Fast has no need to choose another monster card or Elite tier/affix.

Just like before, 12 is higher than 8 and lower than 192, so the spawn will SUCCEED again.

This time, however, Fast does not have enough credits to spawn another T1 Elite - if that had been the case, that Elite would also have been Glacial since the affix has not changed. Fast only pays 8 credits and spawns a T0 Beetle, which leaves it with 4 credits.

The base reward of this basic Beetle is only a mere 28 XP and 56 Gold since it is T0. It spawns, also around Player 2.

Since this spawns SUCCEEDED, Fast keeps its card/elite again and decided to attempt the next spawn 0.23s later.

====t = 4.69s | Attempt 4 : We shall stop for now====

Once our second Beetle has started spawning, Fast decides yet again to try and spawn a Beetle.

Player 2 has still 1.31s going for them, so they are still the target.

Fast also keeps its card/elite yet again.

This time, however, Fast no longer has enough credits to pay for any Beetles (4 credits versus 8 cost) so the spawn FAILS.

Because of this, Fast must now wait much longer - 5.63s this time - before its next spawn. It will also select another card/elite combo - Player 2 is safe for now.

====Past that====

If we were to continue the simulation, we would keep generating random numbers and advance time to simulate a run. We would probably have Fast try another wave or two before Slow makes its first real attempt with the 15 * 18 = 270 credits it had accumulated, enough to spawn one Greater Wisp and almost enough to spawn a Tier 2 Beetle.

The '''Disposable Missile Launcher''' is a [[Ror:Disposable Missile Launcher|returning]] [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, the player launches a total of 12 missiles that deal 300% damage each.

Each missile has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

==Notes==
* If the player picks up a different equipment or activates {{SkillLink|Retool|MUL-T}} as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} before all 12 missiles have fired, the Missile Launcher will keep firing until the backlog has caught up, potentially allowing for two equipment active at once.

The '''Distant Roost''' is a bleak, dreary mountain region located on [[Petrichor V]] and is one of the initial [[Environments]] encountered in ''Risk of Rain 2''.
[[File:Distant roost logbook.png|thumb|212x212px|Logbook View]]

Spires of earth jut through the fog and unknown avian creatures circle far peaks guarding their broods.

There are currently two variants of Distant Roost.

==Interactables==

==Monsters ==

==Newt Altars==
The [[Newt Altars]] can spawn at several locations for each variant of the Distant Roost.

*The Original Variant has 3 possible locations and 0-1 statues will spawn.
#Located down the gap near the land bridge, atop the bigger rock protruding from the wall.
#Behind the rock located on the upper ledge of the island.
# Within the door area, behind the fallen pillar and next to the mossy rock.

*The Altered Variant has 3 possible locations and exactly 1 statue will spawn.
# Atop the arch within the cave.
#Within the door area, at the very edge to the left.
#Located under the several smaller land bridges.

== Trivia==
*Each variant of the stage has a big stone door that may be opened or closed. If opened, it gives access to a new area where chests, a [[Distant Roost#Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] and/or a [[Teleporter]] can spawn. If closed, no chest will spawn in the locked area. 
**As a result, Distant Roost is the only [[Environments|Environment]] in which a Newt Altar is capable of not spawning altogether.
*Towards the distant edges of the map, there are flying, passive monsters that can be killed with certain long-range abilities, such as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} {{SkillLink|Rebar Puncher|MUL-T}} and {{SurvivorLink|Commando|Commando's}} {{SkillLink|Phase Round|Commando}}. They have 1 health, and do not provide gold or experience when killed.
**However they can still trigger on-kill and on-hit effects, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Topaz Brooch}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band|altText=}}{{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band|altText=Bands}}. But since they are not sentient entities as they fly in a preprogrammed fashion, they do not trigger any effects that have this requirement, such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado}}.
**The name of the monsters is called Birdshark, created accidentally when Hopoo messed up when trying to create a model for grass.
*The remains of a [[ror:Colossus|Colossus]] from the original Risk of Rain can be seen outside the edge of the alternative variant of the stage.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update. It is completed by either defeating the boss of [[The Planetarium]] or reaching the ending or by completing wave 50 of the [[Simulacrum]].

There are two methods to complete this challenge.

The first option is to clear the Planetarium, and thus beat the game. There are multiple methods to reach the Planetarium:

* Complete the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}} and go through the Void Portal (not the Null Portal) that spawns after the cells have been breached. Then complete the {{EntityLink|Void Locus}} by charging all four Deep Void Signals, and take the next Void Portal that appears after doing so.
* Wait for a Void Portal to appear in a normal stage. Void Portals have a chance to appear after completing the Teleporter Event on the 6th stage or beyond. This also requires the Void Locus to be completed first.
* When defeating {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} at {{EntityLink|Commencement}}, go back to the [[Teleporter#Primordial Teleporter|Primordial Teleporter]] at the start of the stage, [[Commencement#Glass Frog|pet the frog]] ''ten'' times, and take the Deep Void Portal that spawns there.
** This is a safer method than the others, as it gives direct passage to the Planetarium, rather than risking Void enemies and Void Fog.

After arriving in the Planetarium, defeat the {{MonsterLink|Voidling|alternate final boss}} and end the game to complete the challenge.

The second option is to enter the Simulacrum and beat at least 50 waves, which will also complete this challenge.

== Trivia ==
* There's currently a bug in the game where if the player dies in between wave 46 and wave 50 of the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] but lets the game play out without returning to the character select menu, the enemies will eventually die, granting the player the achievement.

{{Item
| rarity = None
| stacking = None
| ID = 77
| noicon = true
}}
This item is given to the [[Survivors|Survivor]] at the start of a run on {{EntityLink|entityName=Drizzle}} difficulty. 

It gives 70 flat [[armor]] and multiplies base health regeneration by 2.5. 

It is flagged as hidden, and will therefore not show up in the player's visual inventory.

==Trivia==
* This item does not have a name, as it's only referred to in code.[https://discordapp.com/channels/417739215355510784/559901453834256404/571234436507500547]
* Before the Skills 2.0 update, it only gave 70 armor and the health regeneration multiplier was applied to all characters regardless of difficulty.
* Before the Skills 2.0 update, using a [[Shrine of Order]] removed this item from a player's inventory.

'''This is the second major content update for Risk of Rain 2 on PC.''' With this update we are focusing on Skills 2.0, brand new content, as well as other general changes and quality of life improvements.

'''Skills 2.0 introduces a new way to play your favorite survivor! Our new “Loadout” system allows for swappable skills and skins at the beginning of each run.''' Each survivor will maintain their unique identity, but have some options to tinker with before jumping into a run. While some skill variants play off existing skills, some variants are entirely unique abilities available to a survivor. '''Each new skill and skin in your Loadout will be unlocked only with survivor-specific challenges - good luck!''' More skills and skins are planned to be added in future updates.

This Content Update will be coming to consoles soon - for details on how our Content Updates get ported to console versions, check out our previous Development Thoughts [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/1588003708938246571?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_ here]!

Changes with the ‘🌧︎’ icon in front of them are changes or additions suggested by the community. As always, if you want to stay up to date on the game feel free to join the discord at https://discord.gg/riskofrain2

==Gameplay Changes==
*'''General''' 
**Reduce the spawn frequency of the “aggressive” director
*** ''This should result in spawning behavior a bit more similar to Early Access Launch, where the Director will be able to save up a tiny bit more before spawning things. This doesn’t make the game easier or harder - there should just be slightly fewer small monsters, and more big monsters.''
**🌧︎Fix health regeneration boost being applied outside of {{EntityLink|Drizzle}}
*** ''Drizzle difficulty is intended to have increased health regeneration of 250% for players. This was being accidentally applied to ALL difficulties since launch. Oops. We will be monitoring this closely to make sure the pacing of the game stays consistent.''

*'''Survivors'''
** '''{{SurvivorLink|Commando}}''' 
***🌧︎Update {{SkillLink|Suppressive Fire|Commando}} (R) to fire more bullets with more attack speed
*** Add 2 new skill variants
***Add 1 new skin
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}'''
*** 🌧︎ {{SkillLink|Bubble Shield|Engineer}} now flashes before it expires
***🌧︎ Update {{SkillLink|Pressure Mines|Engineer}}:
****🌧︎ Now “arms” over time to 900% damage and an increased radius
*****''Players (including us) were mostly just using Engineer's mines as somewhat underwhelming grenades as soon as they came off cooldown. This change puts more power in strategic placement and reduces how often the skill needs to be used for it to be effective.''
****🌧︎ Now scales max available mines with max secondary stock
****Max Stock 10 ⇒ 4
***Add 2 new skill variants
**'''{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}'''
***🌧︎ Show both primary and alternate fire descriptions in Character Select
***Move “Multifunctional” passive into “{{SkillLink|Retool|MUL-T}}”
**** ''This change was made to make the UI for MUL-T’s skills easier to read. There is no functional difference.''
***Add 2 new skill variants
***Add 1 new skin
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}'''
***Add 2 new skill variants
***Add 1 new skin
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}'''
***Add 2 new skill variants
***Add 1 new skin
**'''{{SurvivorLink|REX}}'''
***Add 2 new skill variants
*** Add 1 new skin
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}'''
***Add 2 new skill variants
*** Add 1 new skin

*'''Items'''
** '''{{ItemLink|Old Guillotine|Guillotine}}'''
***🌧︎Tier: 1 ⇒ 2
***Update Logbook entry to properly reflect its stacking behavior 
****''In the Logbook, it said it scaled the execute threshold by 20%(+5% per stack), but it ACTUALLY stacked by 20% (+20% per stack). Instead of reducing the threshold down to 5%, we decided to keep the current behavior and upgrade it to tier 2 instead.''
** '''{{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}'''
***Regen Rate: 250%(+250% per stack) ⇒ 300%(+300% per stack)
**'''{{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}'''
***🌧︎Proc Chance: 5%(+2.5% per stack) ⇒ 5%(+5% per stack)
**** ''Tier 1 items are the most commonly stacked, and should therefore linearly stack without diminishing returns in most cases.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Crowbar}}'''
***Damage Boost: 50%(+30% per stack) ⇒ 50%(+50% per stack)
****''Tier 1 items are the most commonly stacked, and should therefore linearly stack without diminishing returns in most cases''
**'''{{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}}'''
*** 🌧︎Barrier Gain: 20(+20 per stack) ⇒ 15(+15 per stack)
**'''{{ItemLink|Aegis}}'''
*** 🌧︎Has been reworked in functionality
****Barrier gain from overheal is no longer capped
****Now grants barrier for 50% (+50% per stack) of the amount you overheal
**'''{{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}'''
***🌧︎ Friendly {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} now has special AI to be more aggressive
** '''{{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder|Crowfunder}}'''
***Proc Coefficient: 0.2 ⇒ 1

*'''Stage'''
** '''{{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}'''
***🌧︎ Add Lunar Seers
****''Lunar Seers allow you to, at a price, determine the next upcoming stage. The intent for this is to allow us to continue adding content that is stage dependent (Timed Security Chest on Rallypoint Delta, Broken Robot in Abyssal Depths, etc) without it becoming frustrating in the future to actually land on those maps.''
**'''{{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}''' 
***🌧︎ Brighten ambient lighting
***🌧︎ Ambient lighting is no longer extra dark inside the cave portions

*Elites
** '''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixPoison|Malachite}}'''
***🌧︎ Health Bonus Percentage: 2820% ⇒ 2350%

*Drones
**🌧︎Drones can now be repurchased after they die, excluding TC-280
**'''{{EntityLink|TC-280 Prototype|TC-280}}'''

This Content Update will be coming to consoles in the near future - for details on how our Content Updates get ported to console versions, check out our previous Development Thoughts here: https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/1588003708938246571

Changes with the ‘🌧’ icon in front of them are changes or additions suggested by the community. As always, if you want to stay up to date on the game feel free to join the discord at https://discord.gg/riskofrain2

** Characters with damage interrupt thresholds like {{monsterLink|Lesser Wisp}} and {{monsterLink|Lemurian}} now use total damage received instead of incoming damage with a crit modifier when determining whether or not they should be interrupted when hit.

*** Now properly spawns with unique boss health and damage scaling (Aurelionite, Alloy Worship Unit)
**** ''Developer Notes: This is an enormous change, but was always intended. Expect the Twisted Scavengers to be SIGNIFICANTLY more challenging - Beads of Fealty should now be a significant risk vs reward. They should be treated as a powerful optional boss.''

*** Remove 3 ‘{{itemLink|Tougher Times}}’
*** Remove 3 ‘{{itemLink|Personal Shield Generator|altText=Personal Shield Generators}}’

* Update Quickplay icon
* Update Ally Indicator to make it more useful when trying to find allies

* 🌧 Update ‘Time Crystals’ and ‘Explosive Pots’ to have proper character model setup and proper strings so they are highlighted and named when pinged

* 🌧 Fix ‘[[Cosmic Explorer]]’ not counting the portal to the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}
* 🌧 Fix ‘{{itemLink|Old Guillotine}}’ item not checking if the victim body is immune to executes (no more instantly killing yourself with {{itemLink|Old Guillotine}}, {{itemLink|Wake of Vultures}}, and {{itemLink|Glowing Meteorite}}/{{itemLink|Helfire Tincture}})

* Fix [[Teleporter]]s not using the correct decal layer

This is the fifth major content update for Risk of Rain 2 on PC, marking the 1.0 version of the game. With this update we are focusing on the ending sequence of the game and promoting player agency + build diversity.

Changes with the ‘🌧’ icon in front of them are changes or additions suggested by the community. As always, if you want to stay up to date on the game feel free to join the discord at https://discord.gg/riskofrain2

==Major Content ==

* &lt;big&gt;Added System: Game Ending&lt;/big&gt; 
**The game now includes a proper ending, with credits and cutscene.

*&lt;big&gt;Added System: Server Browser&lt;/big&gt;
**Quickplay served an important function at launch - but the QP featureset is barebones. Not only that, but the game has evolved past needing to just find a match - you need to find the right match. We think a built-in Server Browser (and hosting) will still allow you to connect and find other players easily while also providing a lot of the features and choices you want to make before connecting to a game.

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*&lt;big&gt;General&lt;/big&gt;
** {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding|Bleeds}} now refresh '''all''' existing bleed durations on that target. This affects both enemies and players, and is a '''huge''' change for how bleeds will work.
**Increase [[difficulty]] rate over time for all difficulties by +10%. &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: In this update, we’ve buffed a ton of items - and also given players way more agency over the way a run progresses. Our goal is for players to be more engaged with the game - what we don’t want is for the game to be suddenly much easier. This is a bit of a sanity check, and shouldn’t dramatically change the difficulty.''
** Slightly reworked [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|OSP]]. The goal is to fix inconsistencies and make it actually protect you from one-shots - while also fixing some abuse cases with curse.
***The threshold for OSP is now displayed on the healthbar with a faint graphic.
*** Now has a lingering 0.1s duration when activated.
***🌧 Now is subtracted via Curse ({{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}, etc), i.e a curse of 10% will remove OSP entirely.
***🌧 Update OSP logic so it still triggers if you receive multiple sources of damage in the same frame that go past OSP values, i.e {{StatusEffectLink|AffixPoison|Malachite}} {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisps}}

*&lt;big&gt;Elites&lt;/big&gt;
**'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed|Blazing}}, {{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue|Overloading}}, {{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite|Glacial}}'''
***🌧Health Bonus: 470% ⇒ 400%
**'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixPoison|Malachite}}, {{StatusEffectLink|AffixHaunted|Celestine}}'''
***🌧Health Bonus: 2350% ⇒ 1800% &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: We’ve had a lot of feedback that elite health has always felt a bit bloated - and that subsequently, it makes the Old Guillotine feel required. Our intent is to make characters less reliant on the Old Guillotine, and to make it feel more like an elite hate item - and less of an overall DPS item.''

*&lt;big&gt;Survivors&lt;/big&gt;
***🌧🌧🌧 Mobility skills are now considered ‘sprinting’, scaling with sprint speed multipliers and also sprinting after use.
***Melee Survivors 
**** 🌧 Melee skills will now perform more consistently at high attack speeds.
****Melee skills will now scale hitpause duration with attack speed - since the pause when hitting enemies were static, melee characters actually scaled poorly with attack speed.
****Melee skills will now ‘hold’ you in the air better at high attack speeds.
***Added a ‘[[Keyword]]’ system. Keywords are just words to describe common repeated behavior without explaining it every time. Added the following keywords: 
****{{Keyword|u|Freezing}}
****{{Keyword|d|Stunning}}
****{{Keyword|d|Shocking}}
****{{Keyword|h|Poisonous}}
****{{Keyword|h|Regenerative}}
****{{Keyword|u|Agile}}
**** {{Keyword|hp|Percent HP}}
****{{Keyword|u|Sonic Boom}}
****{{Keyword|d|Weaken}}
****{{Keyword|u|Expose}}
****{{Keyword|u|Heavy}}
**'''{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}''' &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: MUL-T has gotten some love from this patch to really push forward the idea that his weapons are strong in specific roles. Faster swap time and more responsive actions for the weapons will (hopefully) make weapon swapping feel better. We’ve also admittedly creeped cooldowns down over time, and MUL-T felt a bit left behind.''
***Base Acceleration: 25 ⇒ 30
***{{SkillLink|Rebar Puncher|MUL-T}}
****Now charges after firing, rather than before.
***{{SkillLink|Scrap Launcher|MUL-T}}
****Now behaves like a rocket instead of a grenade
****Lifetime: 3s ⇒ 4s
****Explosion Radius: 5m ⇒ 7m
****Velocity: 70m/s ⇒ 100m/s
*** {{SkillLink|Auto-Nailgun|MUL-T|altText=Nail Gun}}
****No longer has an initial shotgun of 6 nails.
****Now has a final shotgun of 12 nails.
****Now fires in a consistent corkscrew pattern
****Proc Coefficient: 0.4 ⇒ 0.6
****Damage: 60% ⇒ 70%
****Wind-down duration: 0s ⇒ 1.152s
*** {{SkillLink|Retool|MUL-T}}
****Swap duration: 0.7s ⇒ 0.4s
*** {{SkillLink|Transport Mode|MUL-T}}
****Cooldown: 8s ⇒ 6s
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}''' &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: The Mercenary was always supposed to be the highest skill-cap survivor. However, in actual gameplay he became very flow-charty, using abilities directly off cooldown while holding down M1. The intent for all these changes is to allow skill expression, dynamic cooldowns, and higher risk vs reward in fight with the new ‘Exposed’ debuff. The hope is that the character will be stronger for advanced players, but weaker for new players.''
***Base Health: 140 (+42 per level) ⇒ 110 (+33 per level)
***Base Regeneration: 2.5 health / second ⇒ 1 health / second
***NEW Debuff: {{Keyword|u|Expose|Exposed}}
****Striking an Exposed target reduces all cooldowns by 1 second and deals an additional +350% base damage
***{{SkillLink|Laser Sword|Mercenary}}
****Third Strike Damage: 300% ⇒ 130%
****Third hit now applies ‘Exposed’ debuff
****The second and third hit of the combo can no longer be started in the middle of other attacks
***{{SkillLink|Whirlwind|Mercenary}} 
****Ground Speed Multiplier: 6 ⇒ 8
***{{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}}
****Cooldown: 7s ⇒ 8s
****Can now be canceled mid-attack by both Whirlwind and Rising Thunder
***{{SkillLink|Slicing Winds|Mercenary}}
**** Last hit now applies ‘Exposed’ debuff
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}''' &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Acrid has always been a melee-ranged hybrid. We want greater rewards for engaging in melee and completing your M1 combo for players who enjoy a more aggressive playstyle.''
***NEW Buff: {{Keyword|h|Regenerative|Regenerate}} 
**** Regenerate for 10% health over 0.5 seconds.
***{{SkillLink|Vicious Wounds|Acrid}} 
****Third hit of the combo now grants ‘Regenerate’ buff
***{{SkillLink|Ravenous Bite|Acrid}}
****Now grants ‘Regenerate’ buff
***{{SkillLink|Frenzied Leap|Acrid}}
****🌧Now (properly) {{Keyword|d|Stunning|stuns}}
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}''' &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: We want to enforce the Artificer’s role as a high-damage, high AoE character. Nano-Bomb in general was core to the fantasy, but was pretty much inferior to Nano-Spear in every way.'' 
***{{SkillLink|Plasma Bolt|Artificer}}
****Blast Radius: 4m ⇒ 6m
***{{SkillLink|Charged Nano-Bomb|Artificer}}
****Now has slight gravity
****Blast Radius: 10m ⇒ 14m
****Blast Damage, Max Charge: 1200% ⇒ 2000%
**** Blast Force: 1300 ⇒ 3000
**** Lifetime: 5s ⇒ 10s
****Improved FX for clarity
***{{SkillLink|Ion Surge|Artificer}}
****No longer has -75% damage falloff at the edge of the blast
*&lt;big&gt;Items&lt;/big&gt;
**'''{{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}'''
***Healing: 8 (+8 per stack) ⇒ 8
***🌧Now also heals for 2% (+2% per stack) of maximum health
**'''{{ItemLink|Medkit}}'''
***Healing: 24 (+24 per stack) ⇒ 20
***🌧Now also heals for 5% (+5% per stack) of maximum health
**'''{{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}''' 
***Now properly reduces damage from environmental effects
**'''{{ItemLink|Warbanner}}'''
***🌧 Now also places a Warbanner when activating the Teleporter
*** Improve VFX to be less opaque, since it will always be near the Teleporter
** '''{{ItemLink|Death Mark}}'''
***Debuff Duration: 7s ⇒ 7s (+7s per stack)
***🌧Remove text stating that the damage bonus scaled with stacks
**'''{{ItemLink|Old Guillotine}}'''
***Execute Threshold: ~20% (+20% per stack) ⇒ 13% (+13% per stack) &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Since we’ve re-tuned the health of elites across the board, the Guillotine should be appropriately re-tuned as well.''
**Runald’s/Kjaro’s Band &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: The two rings have undergone a bit of a rework, working off of an internal cooldown rather than a chance on-hit. We’re hoping that this can help diversify one of our “on-hit” items to be more than just attacking enemies and hoping things activate. We’ve also changed the behavior of Kjaro’s to be more of the AoE option, while Runald’s is the single target option.''
***Proc Chance: 8% ⇒ 100%
***Now has an internal cooldown of 10 seconds
***Now has a minimum threshold of only triggering on attacks that deal 400% or greater damage
***'''{{ItemLink|Runald's Band|altText=Runald’s Band}}'''
**** Ice Blast Damage: 250% (+125% per stack) ⇒ 250% (+250% per stack)
**** Ice Debuff Duration: 3s ⇒ 3s (+3s per stack)
***'''{{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}'''
****Fire Tornado Damage: 500% (+250% per stack) ⇒ 300% (+300% per stack)
****Fire Tornado Hitbox Width: 4.8m ⇒ 13m
**** No longer moves
**'''{{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}}'''
***Reworked logic for calculating fall speed so it scales better while falling farther. Now has the following behavior: 
****Damage Coefficient: 1000% - 10,000% at maximum speed
****Explosion Radius: 5m - 100m at maximum speed
****Improved FX
**'''{{ItemLink|Interstellar Desk Plant}}'''
***Healing Radius: 3m (+1.5m per stack) ⇒ 5m (+5m per stack)
***Healing: 5% max health every 1 second ⇒ 5% max health every 0.5 second
**'''{{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}'''
*** Now grants true flight and antigravity instead of jump-to-hover.
***Pressing jump now performs a short dash in the direction of movement with a 0.5s cooldown.
**'''{{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}'''
***No longer puts you in combat
** '''{{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}'''
***Helfire Radius: 10m ⇒ 15m
***Helfire Duration: 8s ⇒ 12s
***Improve VFX and SFX
**'''{{ItemLink|Effigy of Grief}}'''
***Now placed at where you’re aiming, rather than at your feet
***No longer is consumed on use.
***Now limited to 5 per map per character.
**'''{{ItemLink|Little Disciple}}'''
*** Fire Rate: 0.5s ⇒ 1.6s
***Damage Coefficient: 100% (+100% per stack) ⇒ 300% (+300% per stack)
***🌧Fire Rate now scales with movement speed 

*&lt;big&gt;Stages&lt;/big&gt;

** 3D Printers will cost less to spawn on all stages, ~50% less

**'''{{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}'''
***🌧 Update with new visuals to make it depressing
**'''{{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}'''
*** Update with new visuals and functionality that leads to the final stage
**'''{{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}'''
***Base Portal Chance: 25% for the first portal ⇒ 37.5% for the first portal
***Lunar Buds: 4 ⇒ 5

*&lt;big&gt;Monsters &amp; Bosses&lt;/big&gt;
**'''{{MonsterLink|Mini Mushrum}}'''
***🌧 Base Health: 360 (+108 per level) ⇒ 290 (+87 per level)
**'''{{MonsterLink|Parent}}'''
***🌧 Base Health: 1200 (+360 per level) ⇒ 900 (+270 per level)
**'''{{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}}'''
***Now properly stops charging attack sound when interrupted
**'''{{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord}}'''
*** 🌧Maximum Blink Distance: 600m ⇒ 300m
***Now throws Void Spikes in a staggered fashion, rather than all at once
**'''{{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}}'''
***🌧Maximum “Blink” Distance: 600m ⇒ 300m
***Now considerably more aggressive and better able to hit targets &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: The blink behavior of both the Imp Overlord and the Magma Worm allows it to follow players between platforms, but it leads a lot of the times to the bosses blinking across the map to attack drones and turrets. While they may still do that, it’ll be a bit less pronounced.''
**'''{{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}}'''
***Now attempts to lead its Void Bombs in a straight line against its target
***Updated AI to fire more aggressively and backpedal when its target is too close
*** AI now has 360° vision
**'''{{MonsterLink|Bighorn Bison|24|altText=Bison}}'''

And… scene. This patch is enormous for us, and we really tried hard - I hope you all like it. As always, we’re listening to feedback and tracking any bugs that we find for 1.0 release. We’ll do a Dev Thoughts later this week to compile everyone’s feedback. See you on the planet.

'''This is the third major content update for Risk of Rain 2 on PC.''' With this update we are focusing on expanding the base game with fun and exciting content that the player will see right when the update lands. While [[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0]] had a bunch of challenges and unlocks, some players preferred to have content unlocked in the base game, and we’ve heard the feedback!

This Content Update will be coming to consoles in the near future - for details on how our Content Updates get ported to console versions, check out our previous Development Thoughts here: https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/1588003708938246571

Changes with the ‘🌧’ icon in front of them are changes or additions suggested by the community. As always, if you want to stay up to date on the game feel free to join the discord at https://discord.gg/riskofrain2

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*'''General'''
**Update regens to not be multipliers, but scaling flat bonuses to decouple benefits of regen items from base regen
***The result of this is that all characters regardless of their baseline regeneration all benefit the same from regen items. This will only affect melee characters WITH regen items - nobody else is affected.
**Reduce Boss Encounter ({{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, etc) health scaling by ~20%
** Reduce Boss Encounter ({{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, etc) damage scaling by ~75%
**Change ‘[[Damage#One-Shot Protection|One Shot Protection]]’ calculation to include barrier
***Our intent in changing OSP in this manner is to make sure that it is a hidden mechanic, not a reliable one to build a strategy around. We know there’s still edge cases that are abusable - but as long as it’s not ALWAYS the best strategy, we don’t mind having some end-game builds that are extremely powerful.
***If you have 100% Health and 100% Barrier and take a billion damage, previously you would remain at 100% Health and 10% Barrier. You will now be at 10% Health, as intended before the inclusion of barrier in [[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres]].

***'''{{SkillLink|Grapple Fist|Loader|Grapple}}/{{SkillLink|Spiked Fist|Loader|Spiked Fist}}'''

'''Early Access Patch''' (Build ID #3703355)

This patch is to address critical bugs and issues we've seen in the first week, amongst some minor balance changes.

==&lt;nowiki&gt;==== **Gameplay Changes** ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;== 
*'''**[[Prismatic Trial]]s**'''
** Add Friends-Only Leaderboard
**Update Global Leaderboard to be around your current position in the Leaderboard

*'''**{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}**'''
**Reduce base movement speed from 9 to 7 to match all other Survivors
**Reduce base damage from 12 to 11
**Increase Transport Mode speed boost from 200% to 220% to compensate for his lost base movement speed.
**''We really really don't like to nerf characters in general - these are very light touches, and the movement speed being higher was an oversight. We also want to make sure that MUL-T's big success isn't coming from its ability to abuse Ocular HUD for infinite crits.''

*'''**{{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord}}**'''
**Remove passive regen
**Increase base damage from 13 to 16
**''The boss fight was a big of a slog if you had lower DPS because of the boss' natural regen. Higher damage should make the boss fight more intense.'' 

*'''**[[Teleporter]]**'''
**Add slight rim glow
**Increase teleporter passive particle radius from 38 to 60. Increase particle count so density remains the same.
**''A lot of players are having issues finding the Teleporter. Players are starting to notice the passive particles indicating the teleporter is around - we will try increasing the radius to see if it helps. The rim glow will help distinguish it from identically colored surfaces. This is intended to be a fairly big change - if it turns out we jumped the gun and the community was simply learning, we can approach a middle ground.''


==&lt;nowiki&gt;==== **Bug Fixes** ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;== 
*Corrupted save files no longer prevent the game from initializing past the first splash screen. We will continue to figure out why exactly they are being corrupted in the first place.
*Refactor Multiplayer connection setup to be more stable - hopefully less weird half-states on connecting to other players.
*Selecting the "Quit to Menu" pause menu option from the Prismatic trials no longer temporarily shows the main menu.
*[[Engineering Perfection]] challenge can no longer be completed by starting 30 levels without finishing them.
*Environment logs now count towards the [[Bookworm|10 logs challenge]].
*Equipment - {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} now requires line of sight to use.
*When playing with a controller, pressing the confirm button at the main menu will no longer choose the last option that was hovered onto.
*Revert button text now properly becomes highlighted when functional.
*The {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} is now properly targeted by enemies after he uses a non-primary skill.
*Multiplayer: Characters no longer come back to life after dying in a multiplayer game, leaving it and joining it back.
*{{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}: The Monster Tooth healing orbs heal amount now match the description.
* Multiplayer: Acquired Items now properly show up in the Item bar or the Info Screen after leaving a multiplayer game and joining it back.
*Names can no longer extend beyond the profile text box in the main menu
*Large profile names can no longer overlap the Back button and run off of the screen
*The Enter Quickplay button of the Multiplayer Menu no longer needs to be pressed twice to start searching a lobby when using a controller.
*Holding the Primary Skill Button down while activating {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD}} and shooting with {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|Mul-T}} {{SkillLink|Auto-Nailgun|MUL-T}} no longer deals infinite critical damage.
*Back button in Prismatic Trials' character select no longer returns you to the main menu
*Falloff models for delayed blast attacks ({{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|Titan Fist}}, {{ItemLink|Her Biting Embrace|Ice Affix Death}}, {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp|Willowisp}}) are now properly assigned. This may cause them to do more damage than before.
*Quickplay launch time is now properly Time Zone independent


==&lt;nowiki&gt;==== **QOL** ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;==
*Error messages now tell you when the host is shut down
*Remove collision from Teleporter nub to prevent monsters getting stuck

{{PatchPage}}
This patch is to address a ton of the more severe bugs we couldn't safely patch in the first week, especially associated with connection or desync issues. It also comes alongside some balancing, and also a slight reworking of some Elite affix behaviors to try to make them all equally threatening.

==&lt;nowiki&gt;==== **Gameplay Changes** ====&lt;/nowiki&gt; ==
*'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed|**Fire Elites**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Rework burning calculation with unique new {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|burning}} damage type
**Number of stacks of Burning on the player are now visible in the buff bar.
**Burning is now capped at 5% of your health a second PER stack. Just to be clear - this is a nerf. It'll always hit for less this patch.
**Now ticks at twice the frequency (but same overall damage).
**This damage type has also now been applied to the Magma Worm's impact and fireball damage, alongside Elder Lemurian's fire breath
**''The intent here is to make it clear to the player what exactly a burn DOES, regardless of how it's applied. Players never were told by the game that burning actually stacks. If you have a certain number of burn stacks, you will now be aware of exactly how much that will hit for. Overall this should make the burns way less bursty and way more consistent, also allowing heal over time effects to help counteract the damage. The intent is NOT to make the entire game easier, or to make burns never kill you. Fire elites are the only purely offensive elite-type, so they should be causing deaths. It should just feel less BS now.''

* '''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite|**Ice Elites**}}''' 
**Rework ice bomb
**Improve graphics for ice bomb left when killed to be more clear.
** Ice bomb damage reduced from 350% to 150%
** Ice bomb damage is no longer reduced at the edge of the radius
**Ice bomb now FREEZES characters in the radius for 1.5s
**''*Fire elites have always been the most threatening type, with the other 2 being pretty easy. The hope here is that after the nerf of the Fire affix, the Ice affix can now also be respected as a serious threat. The improved visuals should help clarify what the ice affix actually does - most players don't seem to notice it drops a bomb at all. We're starting with a low freeze duration to test how it feels.*''

*'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue|**Lightning Elites**}}''' 
**Lightning bombs from Lightning Elites now properly attach to players.
**Lightning elites now always spawn at full shields
** Improve lightning bomb graphics

*'''{{MonsterLink|Magma Worm|**Magma Worm**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Now switches between two modes of movement.
***Leaping: goes high in the air, raining fireballs when it impacts the ground. This was the Magma worm's only previous stance.
***Grounded: Snakes low but fast around on the ground.
***''*The intent is to give a break from the Worm's constant leaping and to give short range characters a chance to attack. The Worm should also be an intense fight, not a slog.*''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Reduced armor from 20 to 15 to make it less tanky.
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Can now jump off of platforms so it doesn't get stuck on certain ledges. 

*'''{{EntityLink|A Moment, Fractured|**A Moment, Fractured**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Obliteration now grants all participating players 5 [[Lunar Coins|lunar coins]]. 
*** ''*People want a legit way to get more lunar coins, and there's currently no purpose on obliterating past the first time. This should help alleviate both.*'' 

*'''{{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture|**Helfire Tincture**}}'''
**Increase radius from 6m to 9m.

*'''{{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|**Stone Titan**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Reduce proc coefficient per tick of his laser from 1 to 0.15.
*** ''*This primarily affects the duration of burning effects.*''

*'''{{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab|**Hermit Crab**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Reduce proc coefficient of mortar attack from 3 to 0.5.
*** ''*This primarily affects the duration of burning effects.''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Reduce base health from 150 to 100.

*'''{{MonsterLink|Imp|**Imp**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Reduce base health from 250 to 200.

*'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer|**Artificer**}}'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Increase Artificer proc coefficient on {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt|Artificer}} from 0.2 to 1.
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Increase Artificer proc coefficient on {{SkillLink|Snapfreeze|Artificer|Snap Freeze}} pillars from 0 to 1.
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Increase Artificer's {{SkillLink|Snapfreeze|Artificer|Snap Freeze}} explosion radius from 1.5m to 2.5m to alleviate it not always freezing enemies who trigger it 
***''*Artificer mistakenly had very low proc coefficients. Consider these bug fixes.*''

*'''{{SurvivorLink|Huntress|**Huntress**}}'''
** {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain|Huntress}} proc coefficient raised from 0.1 to 0.2 per tick. 
***''*Arrow Rain had a very low proc coefficient because of its AoE dot status, but it was unnecessarily low.*''

*'''{{SurvivorLink|Mercenary|**Mercenary**}}'''
**Extend timeout duration to recast {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}} from 2s to 3s 
***''*Small QoL. Allows Merc to be able to cast his other abilities between recasts of Blinding Assault without losing his recasts.*'' 

*'''{{SurvivorLink|Commando|**Commando**}}'''
**Improve FMJ impact graphics
***''*We think that a majority of the Commando's problems are actually VFX and SFX making him feel weak and boring. This is a small first step towards that. A full pass will be done in a later patch.*''

* '''**Misc**'''
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Time now pauses in intermission stages ({{EntityLink|A Moment, Fractured|A Moment}}, {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time|Bazaar}}, etc)
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Add 3 second {{StatusEffectLink|HiddenInvincibility|invincibility}} period when first spawning into a map.
**'''[Community Suggestion]''' Add localized formatting for numbers in the scoreboard (i.e it will now say 1,234,567 instead of 1234567.)

== ==== **Bug Fixes** ======
*Fixed a MAJOR issue with preplaced networked objects. This issue was especially frequent for clients with better performance specs than their host. This should fix at least the following bugs:
**'''[Community Found]''' Map assets (portals, shop contents, Teleporters) will no longer sometimes be missing for clients
**'''[Community Found]''' Clients will no longer be stuck in the pod when entering a stage
**'''[Community Found]''' Clients will no longer be stuck mid-air when entering a stage
**'''[Community Found]''' Clients will no longer be unable to select a character if joining from one networked session to another
**'''[Community Found]''' Clients will no longer be missing out-of-bound zones, causing them to fall forever
*'''[Community Found]''' Allow changes in maximum health/shield to instantly fill that missing amount. This means that {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}} / {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} will no longer give you empty shield.
* '''[Community Found]''' Improve spawn logic to reduce chances of spawning through the floor
*'''[Community Found]''' Clean up {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} Turret skill drivers to fix their AI not working sometimes
*'''[Community Found]''' {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} secondary Equipment will no longer inherit the cooldown of the first when picking up Equipment off the floor
*Improve collision detection of {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture|Helfire}} aura
*Update Elite naming for localization and appearance in pings
*Prevent pre-placed map objects spawning into dynamically spawned ones
* '''[Community Found]''' Clean up Save procedures to reduce chance of save corruption
*'''[Community Found]''' Names for reconnected players will now appear correctly instead of ???
*'''[Community Found]''' Bloom can now be turned off in the settings
*Frozen material overlay now properly always display
*Update {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} strafing animation to blend properly. Fix incorrect normal textures. Add missing jump animation.
*'''[Community Found]''' Fix {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer's}} Snap Freeze explosion radius not being large enough to always freeze enemies who trigger it
*Fix AI sometimes considering itself as a target for friendly searches
*'''[Community Found]''' Fix {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engi}} being able to sometimes get more than 2 turrets
*'''[Community Found]''' Fix {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary|Merc}} being able to take major fall damage during dashing attacks. **This is actually a significant portion of blazing deaths - you dash in, get set to 1, and then get ticked for that last point of health.**
*'''[Community Found]''' Remove typo in {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} description
*'''[Community Found]''' Fix slider value text scrolling past the mask in the options menu
*{{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord|Imp Overlords}} no longer blink off into the distance if no viable target is found
*'''[Community Found]''' {{MonsterLink|Brass Contraption}} bodies can no longer be targetted by clients
*{{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}} now properly identifies teleporters and barrels
*Correct some typos
*Reducing screenshake no longer reduces controller vibrations
*Controller vibration no longer persists into the main menu after quitting a run

==&lt;nowiki&gt;==== **QOL** ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;==
*Reduce particle system noise quality to improve performance.
*Allow use of the Pause menu in character select
*Slightly increase bloom threshold in {{EntityLink|Abyssal Depths}} to be less glowy.</text>

hey

Welcome to all the new players who have picked up RoR 2 in the last couple weeks, we are glad to have you join the community!

In this patch we are adding full localization support! We now have official translations for ''Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Russian, French, German, Simplified Chinese, Italian, Spanish, Turkish, and Japanese.''

These can be enabled by Right-clicking on "Risk of Rain 2" in your Steam Library and going to the language tab at the top. Select from the dropdown what language you want to start the game in and hit close.

There are also bug fixes associated with this patch below:

==&lt;nowiki&gt;==== Bug Fixes ====&lt;/nowiki&gt;==
* [[Directors|Director]] no longer stops spawning monsters late in the game
* [[Directors|Director]] logic in selecting/skipping monsters to spawn has been cleaned up
*Reorganize fall damage code to try to fix issues with the server reporting false fall damage hits
*Fix an issue where every item pickup saved immediately to disk, causing a stutter
*Picking up new equipment with {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} no longer fires every frame
*Fix bosses and monsters sometimes spawning behind closed gates on {{EntityLink|Wetland Aspect}}

*Fix pings occasionally having weird scaling issues
*Pinging monsters is now more precise
*Fix {{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord|Imp Overlord's}} void spikes not having their proc coefficient properly assigned. This means that you will bleed and burn for a longer duration from that attack.

*Dramatically improve performance for specific canvases (Character Select, Main Menu, etc)

Hi!

This is a bug fix patch to address critical issues that came up in the first week of Scorched Acres. This patch explicitly does NOT contain balance fixes, since we want to make sure players have enough time to figure out new strategies and preferences with the new content.

== Gameplay Changes ==
* {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}
** Increase damage of {{ItemLink|Fuel Array|Fuel Array's}} explosion from 100% of your health to 300% of your health
** {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}} no longer pierces armor
** Add new graphics to {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}} to clarify that it is not a {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}
* {{MonsterLink|Grovetender}}
** Reduce horizontal jump distance to reduce chance he yotes himself off the stage
* Misc
** [[Shrine of Blood|Blood Shrines]] now take into account shields and barriers to make it more consistent
** Reduce maximum number of overlay effects (burning, shielded, glass, etc) to 6 from 8 for performance

== Bug Fixes ==
* Fix {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary|Mercenary's}} {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}} sometimes having double cooldowns
* Hitting Immune characters or {{ItemLink|Tougher Times|blocked}} attacks no longer applies on-hit effects
** This is especially important for {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, who was previously recieving debuffs like {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|burning}} and {{StatusEffectLink|HealingDisabled|malachite poisoning}} while Immune
* Immune characters can no longer block "armor piercing" health costs ([[Shrine of Blood|Blood Shrines]], {{SurvivorLink|REX}} abilities)
* Fix {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction}} reducing maximum health and also applying curse health reduction on top of it
* Improve performance on {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX's}} entangle graphics
* Fix execute threshold for being frozen showing up on player healthbars
* Fix high overlay counts causing monsters and players to go pink and invisible
* Fix the {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer's}} {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD|Oculur HUD}} being stretched
* Fix typos and formatting errors

Thanks again for everyone's enthusiasm in our new content update. We're very happy with the reception and are excited for our next content updates to come!

You can all now go back to stacking guillotines :)

==Gameplay Changes==
*'''Survivors'''
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}'''
***New Passive: {{SkillLink|ENV Suit|Artificer|altText=ENV-Suit}}
****☂ The Artificer now hovers while holding Jump.
***Add new crosshair
***Add new bloom effects for {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt|Artificer|Firebolt}}
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}'''
***☂ Add true {{StatusEffectLink|HiddenInvincibility|invincibility}} during {{SkillLink|Eviscerate|Mercenary}} and {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}}.
***☂ Add lingering invincibility for 0.6s after {{SkillLink|Eviscerate|Mercenary}} ends.
***☂ {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}} deducts 1 from stock when timed out rather than resetting it all to 0.
***☂ Add “Safe Movement” during {{SkillLink|Eviscerate|Mercenary}} and {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary|altText=Assaulter}} to reduce the chance of clipping through geometry
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}'''
***Turret Base Damage: 19 ⇒ 16
**'''{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}'''
***☂ Now comes down in a unique pod!
**'''{{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}'''
***☂ Raise vertical height of {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain|Huntress}} to be more cylindrical
***Fix Huntress {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain|Huntress}} jump not scaling its animation speed with attack speed
***☂ Add “Safe Movement” during {{SkillLink|Blink|Huntress}} to reduce the chance of clipping through geometry
***Clean up logic in {{SkillLink|Strafe|Huntress}} to possibly prevent double firing

*'''Items''' 
**☂ [[Damage#Critical Strike|Critical Strikes]] no longer double/triple/quadruple/etc “dip” through the proc chain
***''On-hit items have accidentally been benefiting multiple times from critical strikes, resulting in each proc doubling in damage for huge multipliers. While neat, this was ultimately unintentional and not sustainable for the game going forward - so we’re ripping the bandaid now and fixing it. On-hit items have been compensated for the removal of power from this fix.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Frost Relic}}'''
***Has been reworked in functionality
****Now grows in size for every kill, up to a limit that increases with stacking
****Damage: 25% (+25% per stack) per kill ⇒ 150% (+150% per stack)
****Proc Coefficient: 0.05 ⇒ 0.2
****Update graphics to be ~cooler~
**'''{{ItemLink|Ceremonial Dagger}}''' 
***☂ Update AI to be more accurate and performant
***Dagger Damage: 150% ⇒ 150% (+150% per stack)
***Dagger Number: 3 daggers (+3 per stack) ⇒ 3 daggers
**'''{{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}'''
*** Healing Orb: 4 (+4 per stack) ⇒ 6 (+6 per stack)
**'''{{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds|AP Rounds}}'''
***Bonus Damage: 20% (+10% per stack) ⇒ 20% (+20% per stack)
**'''{{ItemLink|Chronobauble}}'''
***Slow Duration: 1 (+1 per stack) ⇒ 2 (+2 per stack)
***Update tier color outline to match other items
**'''{{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1|AtG Missile}}'''
***Damage: 300% (+300% per stack) additive damage ⇒ 300% (+300% per stack) total damage
**** ''To compensate for the Crit fix, we’ve moved over on-hit effects to deal a percentage of TOTAL damage. That is, if you have a proc that deals 300% damage from an attack that hits for 100, it will hit for 300. Previously it was a complicated additive formula - this change is either neutral or a buff for every character, and GREATLY benefits slow, high-damage attacks like the Artificer’s.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Ukulele}}'''
***Damage: 80% additive damage ⇒ 80% total damage
**'''{{ItemLink|Sentient Meat Hook|Meat Hook}}'''
*** Damage: 100% additive damage ⇒ 100% total damage

***Damage: 250% (+125% per stack) additive damage ⇒ 180% total damage
**'''{{ItemLink|Runald's Band|Runald’s Band}}'''
***Damage: 250% (+125% per stack) additive damage ⇒ 250% (+125% per stack) total damage
** '''{{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band|Kjaro’s Band}}'''
***Damage: 500% (+250% per stack) additive damage ⇒ 500% (+250% per stack) total damage
**'''{{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}'''
***Damage: 60% additive damage ⇒ 60% total damage
**'''{{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned|Gesture Of the Drowned}}'''
***Cooldown Reduction: 50%(+50% per stack) ⇒ 50% (+15% per stack)
****''GoTD, unlike most other Lunar items, doesn’t have stacking drawbacks, and should therefore stack more like a Tier 2 in power.''
**'''{{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}'''
***Update Brittle Crown’s item log description to now show stacking behavior
**'''{{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion|N’Kuhana’s Opinion}}'''
***Fix item pickup not having both horns highlighted

**'''All Stages'''

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''. 

When activated, a quantum tunnel will spawn, with one end at the holder's current location and the other end at their cursor. The tunnel can be up to 1000 meters long, and interacting with either end of the tunnel will cause the player to travel to the other end.

Each quantum tunnel lasts 30 seconds and unlike the {{ItemLink|Remote Caffeinator}} there is no limit to how many active tunnels can exist for each user at the same time.

== Notes == 
* Any player can go through the quantum tunnel, not just the player who created it.
* A player going through the tunnel can exit early by jumping.
* If the tunnel expires, the purple zipline will disappear but the player will continue travelling towards their destination as normal.
* The player is still vulnerable to damage while travelling through the tunnel.
* Upon entering the tunnel, the player accelerates at 30m/s^2 with an initial speed of 0. Since the maximum distance is 1000, it takes approximately 8.16 seconds to reach the other side with a final speed of approximately 245m/s. Upon exiting the player retains half the speed they have acquired.
** The player should be careful about aiming the tunnel towards the ground as a high exit speed can inflict massive fall damage.

== Tips ==
* This equipment can be used to skip charging pillars on [[Commencement]] by creating a tunnel directly to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss's}} arena.
** This is especially useful in multiplayer since only one player on the team needs a Vase. Most pillar-skipping strategies require all players to have sufficient mobility items and/or skills.

== Trivia ==
* The Eccentric Vase's appearance is based on a [[wikipedia:Klein bottle|Klein bottle]], a theoretical object with only one surface which cannot be properly visualized in three dimensions without intersecting with itself.

== Bugs ==
* The {{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern}} causes the Eccentric Vase to not work as intended, placing the other quantum tunnel end short of its intended position, and at times blocking the placement of the tunnel entirely.

The '''Effigy of Grief''' is a [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When activated, a pillar-like effigy is placed at the player's cursor (similarly to {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}}), which inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}} on all entities (players and monsters alike) within a 15m radius. Each player can have up to 5 effigies active at once, and if a new one is placed the oldest one expires. The effigies do not disappear otherwise.

== Tips ==
* Timing and correct placement is key for utilizing this item to its full potential. Be aware of the surrounding environment and place the effigy at the right time and in the right place to maximize damage.
* Avoid the {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}} while holding this equipment, as the effigies will automatically be placed when ready.
* This item is not recommend for melee [[Survivors]] like the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}}, since they must get close to enemies to attack and are likely to be Crippled by this item.
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}} has some good synergy with this item, as Cripple contributes to the 4 debuffs necessary and also reduces enemies' armor, causing them to take even more damage.
* Survivors with a high enough hit rate for {{ItemLink|itemName=Shattering Justice}} can potentially lower an enemy's armor by another 60 points, on top of the 20 armor loss from Cripple. Depending on the enemy's base armor, this could range from a 37.50% to 44.44% damage increase.
** Shattering Justice also contributes to Death Mark with {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PulverizeBuildup}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Pulverized}} (though not at the same time).
* The effigies have collision and are perpendicular to the surface they are placed on. They can therefore be used for platforming, although the reduced movement speed from Cripple may make this more trouble than it's worth.
** This also makes the effigies capable of activating the pressure plates on {{EntityLink|entityName=Abandoned Aqueduct}}.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Ben's Raincoat|altText=Ben's Raincoat's}} will block the debuff, but it will still be applied immediately after it gets blocked. This can provide a decent and consistant source of barrier, but will still leave you crippled.

==Trivia==
*The Effigy appears to be a sculpture of an abstract/uncanny resemblance of a lizard or {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lemurian}}. It likely is made to look like it is screaming or reeling in pain.
**The key features of the Effigy are its stalked/bulging eyes, flailing tongue, and nostrils on the very top of the sculpture towards the end of its muzzle.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion. 

Every 3 seconds ''(-50% per stack)'', this item generates a floating orb around the holder, up to a maximum of 3 ''(+1 per stack)''. When an orb gets close to an enemy, it rapidly homes in on it, exploding on contact for 360% damage. 

Every 60 seconds, the holder will lose one random item and gain a stack of Egocentrism. The item lost is random and can come from any rarity, including other lunar items. This timer does not change with increasing stacks of Egocentrism.

== Notes==
*{{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of 3s (-50% per stack) per orb is incorrect. The actual time to summon each orb is &lt;math&gt;3/stacks&lt;/math&gt;seconds per orb.
**Since only 1 orb can be summoned per frame, this makes 180 Egocentrisms the effective limit for damage per second, at 21,600% per second. However, additional stacks beyond this still enable the player to have a larger quantity of orbs at once, giving increased burst damage at the start of an encounter.
*After reaching the 15th Egocentrism, bombs will be generated further away from the Survivor, forming multiple progressively larger orbits of bombs.
*The [[Survivors|Survivor's]] head is replaced with a large glowing sphere.
*{{PAGENAME}} will not convert any [[Items#Untiered|untiered]] items, such as the {{ItemLink|Empty Bottle}}, {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch (Broken)}}, and even {{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction|altText=Tonic Afflictions}}.
*Items are chosen randomly regardless of number of stacks, rarity, or how recently they were picked up; an item with 30 stacks is just as likely to have one of them assimilated as an item with only 2 stacks.
*The orbs ignore terrain completely, both when orbiting the holder and when attacking enemies.
**When holding a {{ItemLink|itemName=Brilliant Behemoth}}, the orbs will trigger the Behemoth's explosion on contact with terrain.

==Tips==
*Because Egocentrism will eventually consume all other items, it makes having a good [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] even more important than usual. Equipment with short cooldowns work best, such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Gnarled Woodsprite}} for consistent extra healing or {{ItemLink|itemName=The Crowdfunder}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Royal Capacitor}} for long-range damage.
**If the player has multiple equipment charges from {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, the extra charges remain even after the Fuel Cells are lost. However, after those charges are used up the player will need to find more Fuel Cells in order to store extra charges again.
* The bombs' short range (and the item-consuming nature of Egocentrism) makes it difficult to use for [[Survivors]] who lack innate mobility skills, since movement-related items are always in danger of being lost. 
**Ironically, the bombs themselves can also provide range with enough stacks of Egocentrism. While this can still result in a loss of movement items, this can offset the range downside.
*Egocentrism works best on survivable short-range Survivors such as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} and {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}. It can also work well for {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} because of its innate ability to heal itself, even without any items.
*{{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets inherit his Egocentrisms and have a slightly higher base damage stat than him. Egocentrism makes each turret type even better at its role: {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|altText=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} can eliminate nearby foes and defend an area even better, while the{{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret|altText=TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} charge straight towards enemies and relentlessly attack, making their offense even more dangerous.
*Avoid Egocentrism when playing as the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}, as losing any Heresy item will leave her with the useless {{SkillLink|skillName=Nevermore}} skill in its place. This is especially dangerous when losing the {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}, removing Heretic's only innate way to recover her degenerating health.
*This item makes getting the logbook entries for the {{ItemLink|Pearl}} and {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}} much easier, although it is still time-consuming. By having at least 1 other item, the player can find a [[Cleansing Pool]] and complete that stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] so that no enemies spawn, then repeatedly use the Cleansing Pool while they have at least 1 Egocentrism. If no Irradiant Pearls are found, they simply wait until the Egocentrism converts all the Pearls back into Egocentrism, and repeat.
* Egocentrism assimilates items even while the timer is frozen in [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]]. This means the player can simply idle to gain more Egocentrism for later use (either for Cleansing Pools or for fighting), without worrying about [[Difficulty#Scaling Difficulty|scaling difficulty]].
*Egocentrism provides the only way to remove non-consumable Void Items from the player's inventory, aside from using the Shrine of Order. This can be helpful in case the player accidentally picks up a void item that corrupts items important to their build, or if they simply no longer want the items. However, this is highly imprecise, and Egocentrism will very likely damage the player's build itself. 
**This strategy is more useful on a stage with a [[Cleansing Pool]], as the player can convert all of the Egocentrisms into  {{ItemLink|Pearl|altText=Pearls}} and {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl|altText=Irradiant Pearls}}, providing increases to their stats and preventing Egocentrism from consuming any more items.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Elder Lemurian|returning]] [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and the grown-up version of the {{MonsterLink|Lemurian}}. It is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Lemurian}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Elder Lemurian's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Fireball Volley ===
The Elder Lemurian fires 5 fireballs in a 45° arc. Each fireball travels at 45m/s for 6 seconds. The fireballs explode upon despawning or on impact dealing 200% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot falloff]].

While this attack has a duration of 2 seconds (scaling with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), any attack can interrupt it even itself. Therefore, for all intents and purposes it is only limited by its own cooldown duration, which is 4 seconds.

=== Secondary: Fire Breath ===
The Elder Lemurian opens its mouth for 0.3 seconds (scales with attack speed) and then breathes fire aimed directly at its feet for 1.3 seconds, dealing damage over 10 ticks. Each hit deals 48% damage, has a proc coefficient of 0.4, and will add a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=burn}} stack to the target. This attack has an end lag of 1 second, which also scales by attack speed.

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second that only starts once the end lag of the skill has finished.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use secondary''': the Elder Lemurian must be within 15m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Use primary and chase''': the Elder Lemurian must be within 50m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will be active for 2 seconds.
# '''Use primary and stop''': the Elder Lemurian must be within 50-80m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will also be active for 2 seconds. This allows the player to maintain distance by kiting, as every time the Elder Lemurian enters the 80m range and have the skill on cooldown, it will fire and stop, giving the player the chance to build more distance.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Notes ==
* While Elder Lemurians are relatively easy to kill on their own, be aware that they are still dangerous since they can move fast and their flamethrower deals immense damage. Take caution when there are multiple of them.
* Be aware that an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite's]] Fire Breath is even more powerful than normal and can kill players rapidly with its immense damage.
* Elder Lemurians shake the screen whenever they spawn nearby.  Keep this in mind to avoid getting surprised by them.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Anniversary Update]]
* Major Content
** Added New Lore Entry: Elder Lemurian

; [[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update]]
* Quality of Life

}}

== Trivia ==
* The Elder Lemurian's primary attack can fire fewer than 5 shots for extremely high values of attack speed. Since each shot can be fired in an individual frame, for an attack speed of 30, the attack will end after 4 shots. For values of attack speed of 120 or higher, only one shot will ever be fired.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

Upon hitting an enemy there is a 15% chance to fire an electric boomerang that travels a short distance before returning, dealing 124% ''(+124% per stack)'' [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|base damage]] with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and stunning any enemies hit. The initial shot and the return trip count as separate attacks, allowing the boomerang to hit twice. Additionally, after the initial strike, the boomerang deals 40% ''(+40% per stack)'' base damage rapidly with a proc coefficient of 0.2.

==Notes== 
*{{Color|note|Correction:}} the boomerang deals 124% damage instead of 120%, which may be unintended. The additional 120% base damage is not always accurate, as the boomerage deals 40% damage every 2 frame while piercing an enemy. For very small enemies this will strike only 1-2 times, for medium-sized enemies 2-3 times, and for larger enemies 4+ times.

==Tips==
*While the Boomerang benefits from survivors with high fire rate, such as {{SurvivorLink|Commando}}, {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}, and {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}, its limited range requires to player to stay within medium range to ensure it hits any targets.
**{{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} and other survivors equipped to engage enemies from a greater distance will not see much benefit out of this item.
*Due to the Boomerang's flying straight forwards when fired and not homing on to monsters, Engineer's turrets get great use out of this item as they will always be looking at enemies as long as they are close enough. On the other hand, {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} may get less use out of this item for the same reason since she does not typically look at her targets for very long if at all.
*Proc items, such as {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}, {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}, and {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} all synergize very well with this item due to the Boomerang's 1.0 proc coefficient.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

This item spawns a blue orb every 10 (-10% per stack) seconds nearby the player which when picked up grants the {{StatusEffectLink|Elusive Antlers Speed}} buff. This increases movement speed by 12%, lasts for 12 seconds, and can be stacked up to 3 ''(+3 per stack)''. 

== Notes== 
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The actual duration between orb spawns is &lt;math&gt;10 - (1 - \frac{3}{3 + stacks - 1}) \times 8&lt;/math&gt;. As such, the second stack shaves off 2 seconds, which is not 10% of 10 seconds.
**Regardless of the number of stacks picked up, the duration will never be lower than 2 seconds. Do note that when picking up the item or respawning, the first orb always spawns after 3 seconds and the rest follow the formula above.
**If for some reason an orb fails to be spawned, e.g., no available spawn nodes, the timer will still reset.
*There is a maximum of uncollected 10 orbs that can spawn per player.
*The orbs always spawn in front of the holder's field of vision, taking into account their velocity, in order to not disturb the intended travelling direction the player is currently following.
*If the player moves more than 120m away from an orb, it will despawn but only if it has existed for at least 60 seconds. If an orb despawns due to the out-of-range condition and the player has not already reached the maximum of 10 orbs, another orb will instantly be spawned near the player's current position.
*The orbs have a natural expiration duration of 2000 seconds.
*Any allies, even ones that come from items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Queen's Gland}}, can pick up the orbs and benefit from the effect. The amount of buff stacks the entity that picks up the orb can gain depends on how many item stacks the player that spawned the orb holds, not how many the one that picks it up has.
*Picking up an orb while already having the Elusive Antlers buff, the buff's duration is reset even if no more stacks can be granted.
*While this item can be given to {{ArtifactLink|Devotion|Devoted Lemurians}}, due to not being player entities they cannot spawn orbs.
**On the other hand, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turret can spawn them. It is unclear which behavior is the intended one.

==Tips==
*Since the buff lasts for 12 seconds and an orb spawns every 10 seconds by default, it does not leave a lot of time to chain the pickups in order to refresh the buff's duration. Acquiring more item stacks aleviates that issue, on top of any other benefits this provides.
*The player can intentionally pool orbs on the ground or along a certain path, in order to instantly achieve and maintain the maximum speed bonus. This can be useful for clearing jumps that require higher movement speed, or for looting chests deep in the [[Void Fog]] in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].
*Having a lot of [[Interactables#Drones|drones]] and [[Monsters#Other Monsters|other allies]] can lead to them accidentally picking up a lot of the orbs and thus reducing the effectiveness of the item for the player.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Interactibles#Drones|drone]] that supports the player by healing their [[Survivors|Survivor]]. Once purchased, the Emergency Drone flies close by and follows them. It is possible to bind more than one Emergency Drone to the Survivor. After finishing the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], the Emergency Drone travels to the next [[Environments|Environment]] along with the rest of the party.

It is similar in function to the {{EntityLink|Healing Drone}}, but is much more expensive, more durable, can heal more rapidly, and can heal multiple targets at once.  

==Skills &amp; Behavior==

=== Primary: Heal ===
The Emergency Drone heals an ally below full health for 5 seconds even if they are fully healed in its duration. This ally could be the player, a minion, or another drone.

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second.

=== Behaviors ===
The Emergency Drone features the same behaviors as the [[Healing Drone#Behaviors|Healing Drone]], but it has two additional ones at the end of the list.

# '''Go to owner''': no requirements.
# '''Go to closest ally''': the target must be at least 10m away. This behavior ensures the Emergency Drone will always follow an ally even if its owner is dead.

{{MonsterPage|Delighted Probe}}
{{MonsterPage|Quiet Probe}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Solus Control Unit}}.  

They summon two friendly {{MonsterLink|Solus Probe|Solus Probes}}, one colored red and one colored green, who will attack enemies near the player with a laser beam. Similarly to {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}, these minions have stronger stats than their regular counterparts, with 4 times the health and a damage stat that increases by 100% (''+100% per stack'') per ally on the team, including themselves. The Solus Probes are re-summoned every 30 seconds if they are destroyed and they only take 25% of damage dealt by AoE attacks due to a hidden +300 armor bonus against them. 

==Notes==

* {{Color|note|Bug:}} any stack beyond the first one does not properly increase the damage by 100% per stack. The bonus damage is calculated as &lt;math&gt;stacks \times (teamSize - 1)&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;stacks \times teamSize - 1&lt;/math&gt;. For example, with just one player and both Probes alive the first stack correctly grants a bonus of +200% damage, for a total of 300% damage, but the second stack only grants +400% instead of +500%.
* Allies include [[Interactibles#Drones|drones and turrets]], other players, and minions spawned by items like {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}, as well as ghosts spawned by {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}}. Essentially, every entity that appears on the column on the left side of the HUD.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, four Probes will spawn instead of two, augmenting their damage output.
*The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the few [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] items that {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets will not inherit.
*When the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} steals the player's items, he will gain his own Probes and they will attack the player, dealing high damage.
**This becomes even more dangerous if he steals multiple Empathy Cores or Queen's Glands, as the Probes will become extremely powerful.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader|altText=Loader's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Spiked Fist|survivorName=}} can pull the Probes to her, although this will not damage them.
*The Probes have collision, allowing players to stand on them. However, it may be difficult to remain there given how they move around when enemies are near.
*The Probes will ''not'' respawn once the player has hit the ally limit of 20, which includes the player(s) themselves. If there is only 1 ally spot available, only one of them can respawn. Reaching the ally limit, e.g. by summoning a friendly {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Aurelionite}} with a {{ItemLink|itemName=Halcyon Seed}}, will not cause the Probes to despawn; however, if one of them dies then it will not respawn until the ally number has dropped below the limit.
*{{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}}: Despite the probes not visually obtaining any augmentations, they will gain all of the buffs and chaingun granted by this item, and since Col Droneman is another ally, the damage it deals will get boosted as well.
* Even though it is a different Monster, the {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} can be used on the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}} to get this item.
*The damage boost per stack of the item the player holds is updated in real-time, so scrapping empathy cores will remove their team size damage scaling; however it will not immediately kill the probes. Likewise, increasing the players stack size will improve the probes' stats without needing them to be respawned first.
* The cores do actually include their owner in the ally total, but the scaling is number of allies -1 so they are functionally removed.

== Trivia ==
*This item's name and the "personalities" of the Probes it summons ("Quiet" and "Delighted") may be a reference to the [https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Cores Personality Cores] from the Portal series.
*The colors of the Probes resemble that of [https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Twins The Twins] boss from the game Terraria, a pair of colossal mechanical eyes that are also red and green.
* The Probes are wrapped in cloth similar to that worn by the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}}, suggesting a possible link between the two.
**This is especially intriguing given the Heretic's strong resemblance to an {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alloy Vulture}}, and the Alloy Vultures' relationship with the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alloy Worship Unit}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corrupted version of the {{ItemLink|itemName=Rusted Key}}.

With this item in the player's possession, an [[Chests#Encrusted Cache|Encrusted Cache]] resembling a small purple sphere will spawn somewhere on the map when teleporting in. Interacting with this cache will consume an Encrusted Key and drops a [[Void Potential]] orb, allowing the player to choose between three [[Items#Void|{{Color|void|void}}]] items (41.66%/{{Color|#9CE562|41.66%}}/{{Color|#E58262|16.66%}}).

This chance is affected by the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]] and as a result {{Color|uncommon|uncommon}} options are more likely and {{Color|legendary|legendary}} options are much less likely than expected. The effective chance is (42.37%/{{Color|#9CE562|50.84%}}/{{Color|#E58262|6.79%}}).

==Notes==
*{{color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of (''60%/{{Color|#9CE562|30%}}/{{Color|#E58262|10%}}'') is incorrect.
*As void items do not have a discernible rarity and all fall under the same umbrella of [[Items#Void|{{Color|void|void}}]], their "rarity" as considered for the cache's drop chances is the rarity of the uncorrupted counterparts (e.g. the {{ItemLink|itemName=Needletick}} is the corruption of the {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}}, a white item, and so the Needletick is considered a "white" void item).
*Void caches will spawn even if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled.
* If the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is active, the void cache rarity will always be common.
*The Encrusted Key will only corrupt other Rusted Keys while at least 1 Encrusted Key is in the player's inventory. Consuming an Encrusted Key will remove it from the player’s inventory, thereby preventing future Rusted Keys from becoming corrupted. This is the only void item that can be removed from a player’s inventory. 
*In multiplayer, a cache is spawned for each player holding an Encrusted Key.

==Tips==
*Since the void cache itself can contain an Encrusted Key, the player can choose to take it and get a new void item on the next stage if neither of the other 2 options were desirable.

      <text bytes="7317" sha1="r09zze7vulhfx7s6disuc4ygo1nd31s" xml:space="preserve">Every entity in ''Risk of Rain 2'' that is not controlled by the player implements a set of predefined behaviors and by using a series of logical steps it chooses how to move, engage in combat, or disengage. A lot of these behaviors have requirements to be met before they are chosen and as such the player can prevent any enemy from using a specific skill, or know when to expect a certain attack and prepare themselves in advance.

==Behaviors==
Every behavior can be described by its requirements for valid selection and what actions the enemy will take upon selecting it.

===Requirements===
Not every requirement has to be defined for a behavior, in which case it is assumed to have the least restrictive value.

*skill slot: defines which skill type is to be used, i.e., Primary, Secondary, Utility, or Special. Note that not all monsters have all four. The keyword None is used to not necessitate the existence of any specific skill.
*skill: the enemy must possess a certain skill. This is mostly used for the [[Artifacts#Vengeance|Umbra]] and {{ItemLink|itemName=Goobo Jr.|altText=Gummy Clone}} Survivors who can have alternative skills for any of the skill slots. If the 'skill slot' is defined, but the 'skill' is not, it will simply use whichever skill is occupying that slot.
*skill is ready: the selected skill must have at least one charge.
*equipment is ready: the user must possess an equipment and have at least one charge.
*user health: the user must have less than, more than, or a range of some health percentage.
*target health: the target must have less than, more than, or a range of some health percentage. This is mostly used by [[Interactables#Drones|healing drones]].
*distance: the target must be in less than, more than, or a range of some distance.
*line of sight: the user must have the target in line of sight, even if they are behind them.
*aim target: the user must be looking in the direction of the target.
*grounded: the user must be on the ground.
*no repetition: the same behavior cannot be chosen twice in a row.

===Actions===
Only the actions defined for a specific behavior will be taken.

*ignore node graph: the user will move without using the predifined points in an [[Environments|Environment]] as target destinations, but will attempt to reach the target destination directly.
*move type: defines how the user will move, i.e., Chase, Strafe, Flee, or Stop.
*target type: defines what the user will target, i.e., Enemy, Friend, Leader, or Custom. Friend is the nearest teammate within skill range, Leader is used for the owner of any minions, e.g., Drones, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Guard|altText=Beetle Guards}}, etc, and Custom is used for any targets that do not fit under the previous definitions.
*aim type: defines where the user will look, i.e., Target, Enemy, Leader, Move Direction, or None.
*sprint: the user will attempt to sprint.
*fire equipment: the user will attempt to use the equipment. Equipment that require target confirmation, such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Royal Capacitor}}, can make sure the activation will succeed by using the 'line of sight' and 'aim target' requirements.
*behavior timer: how long the user will stick with this behavior before selecting a new one. A negative value means a selection will be forced on the next frame.
*next behavior: when the 'behavior timer' triggers a new selection, check if a predefined next selection is valid. This can be used to chain certain actions.
*reset enemy target: upon selecting a different behavior to the current one, choose a new enemy target. This may end up being the same one.

==Behavior Priority==
Every monster has a predetermined list of behaviors and when it comes to choosing a new one the game will go over all of them in order until it finds the first one that passes all of its requirements. As such, the behaviors are generally ordered from most to least restrictive requirements. Considering skill cooldown timers or the fact that most [[Monsters#Bosses|bosses]] and [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special bosses]] use their Special skill only after having lost a percentage of their health, the ordering priority tends to be Special &gt; Utility &gt; Secondary &gt; Primary. After that a monster may also have a few failsafe behaviors when it can't use any skills, such as strafing an enemy while waiting for a skill cooldown, repositioning, or finding a new target.

Certain behaviors can also be mutually exclusive. For example, an enemy that prefers to stay within a certain distance to use a skill will have 3 distinct behaviors which can be described as "flee and use skill if closer than some distance", "strafe and use skill if within the ideal distance range", "approach and use skill if further than some distance".

The vast number of combinations for skills, requirements, and actions can result in an engagement exhibiting complex behaviors. For example, when the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Wandering Vagrant}} uses its Homing Orb followed by the Orb Volley, it may give the impression that the Orb Volley is just a distraction tactic to force the player to evade the attack and not focus on the homing orb. However, this is technically the result of the Secondary skill being on cooldown and the Primary skill being the only other available option.

==AI States==

===Wander===
The majority of enemies will be in this state when they first spawn and will have no preset behavior. They will select a random nearby position from the node graph, look at it and move towards it. After 0.5 seconds they will select a new position and will repeat this process every 0.2 seconds from then on. For a random interval between 0.5 seconds and 4 seconds the enemy selects a new look position depending on which direction they are facing. If there is something in front of them within a 25 meter distance, they may switch to the '''Look Busy''' state. Every frame they will also try to select a valid behavior. If one is found, they will switch to the '''Combat''' state.

===Look Busy===
The enemy will select a duration between 2 seconds and 7 seconds randomly to stay in this state, during which they will stand still. If during this time a valid behavior is chosen, they will switch to the '''Combat''' state. Once this state expires, the enemy will revert back to the '''Wander''' state.

===Guard===
This is like the '''Look Busy''' state, but the duration is effectively 0. Only {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} and the [[Twisted Scavenger]] spawn in this state. The point of this state is for the enemy to stand still until engaged in combat. Mithrix, due to the arena size and him having 360° field vision, will instantly find a target and engage in combat. The Twisted Scavenger sits facing away from the player, so until the player attacks him so he can be registered as an enemy to retaliate, or the player walks in front of the vision of the Scavenger, he will remain idle.

===Combat===
This is the state that enemies will spend the majority of their lifetime. They will update their movement, aim direction, and issue button presses based on what the current behavior dictates. If in the process of selecting a new behavior the list has been exhausted without finding a valid one, the enemy will revert to its main state type.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

While sprinting, the holder's movement speed increases by about 17.24% (''+17.24% per stack''). After accounting for the movement speed multiplier when sprinting, this comes to a final speed bonus of 25% (''+25% per stack'') while sprinting.

== Notes ==
* This item is stronger on [[Survivors]] who have the {{Keyword|u|Agile}} keyword on their skills, such as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} or {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}.
* Like all speed-increasing items, grabbing an excessive amount will make it more difficult to maneuver.
* The item does ''not'' raise the sprint speed multiplier; instead, it gives a movement bonus that only applies while sprinting. Because the multiplier is not affected, the Energy Drink does ''not'' improve other movement-related items, like {{ItemLink|itemName=Paul's Goat Hoof}}.
* When compared to {{ItemLink|itemName=Paul's Goat Hoof}} while sprinting, the hoof provides a 20.3% increase in speed, while the energy drink's is of 25%. Keep in mind that while the hoof is active at all times, the drink is only of use if the character is sprinting, this also means energy drinks are of no use to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss}} on the last phase.

** 🌧 Speed Boost: 30% (+20% per stack) ⇒ 25% (+25% per stack) &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: Mathematically, the Energy Drink was worse than the Goat Hoof for speed after the first pickup, even while sprinting. This change will consistently make Energy Drink stronger when sprinting, and also makes its stacking behavior more consistent. This may make the Energy Drink too strong, but it’ll at least make a bit more sense now.''

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

With an assortment of deployable gadgets, the Engineer's strength comes not from him alone, but rather his ability to set up a variety of defensive measures. 

The Engineer's signature ability is his deployable turrets, which gain the same [[items]] that Engineer himself has. This makes him unique, as item selection doesn't necessarily come down to what benefits himself, but also what can benefit his turrets. 

Completing the [[Engineering Perfection]] challenge will unlock Engineer as a playable survivor.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

=== Engineer ===

# '''Use primary (paint Harpoons) and strafe''': Engineer must be within 60m from the target. This behavior is active for 1.5 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row. While it uses the primary skill button, it is in the targetting context of Thermal Harpoons.
# '''Use secondary (cancel Harpoons) and strafe''': this behavior is active for 0.1 seconds and is used in the targetting context of Thermal Harpoons when there is no line of sight to the target or to cancel the painting mode early if all Harpoons have been queued.
# '''Use secondary and strafe''': Engineer must be within 17m from the target. The character will sprint and the behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use special''': Engineer must be within 22m from the target and this behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use utility (Thermal Harpoons)''': Engineer must be within 20-60m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 0.1 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use utility (Bubble Shield)''': Engineer must be within 12m from the closest ally. Since there is no implicit use of the Special skill with {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}}, it will never be used.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': Engineer must be within 17m from the target. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use primary and run towards ally''': Engineer must be within 8-40m from the closest ally. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row. The intention of this behavior is to stay close to his turrets, but any ally satisfies the requirement. As such, if the player is near the character while also another monster is nearby, in the absence of other skills being off cooldown the character will toggle between using his primary while strafing the player and staying close to the ally.
# '''Use primary and chase''': Engineer must be within 20m from the target.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

=== TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret ===

# '''Use primary''': the Turret must be within 60m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. The behavior is active for 1 second and a new target will be selected after this.
# '''Search for target''': no requirements.

=== TR58 Carbonizer Turret ===

# '''Return to leader''': the Turrent must be more than 110m from its summoner. This behavior is active for 5 seconds and the Turret will sprint for its duration. A new target will be selected after this.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Turret must be within 15m from the target and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 3 seconds and a new target will be selected after this.
# '''Use primary and chase''': the Turret must be within 15-25m from the target and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 1 second and a new target will be selected after this.
# '''Return to leader (version 2)''': the Turret must be more than 6m from its summoner. A new target will be selected after this. Due to the ordering of the previous behavior, this can only be selected if the Turret is within 110m from its leader and more than 25m from any enemy. The Turret will also not sprint during this and the behavior is intended as a soft leash to the leader when all nearby enemies have been killed.
# '''Do nothing''': the Turret's summoner must still be alive and a new target will be selected after this. This is mostly used when the Turret is near its summoner and there are no enemies to engage. Unlike most other allies and [[drones]] which have a fallback behavior to chase down enemies when their summoner is dead, this Turret exhibits no such behavior. As such, it will wander aimlessly and attack enemies if it ever gets within range.

==Tips==
*{{Color|engineer|Turrets}} will not receive new [[items]] that {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} picks up after they have been deployed. Their items are only updated upon redeployment.
*{{Color|engineer|Turrets}} will ''not'' inherit {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}, {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}, {{ItemLink|Focused Convergence}},  {{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}}, {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}, and {{ItemLink|Warbanner}}.
*{{Color|engineer|Turrets}} ''will'' inherit {{Color|engineer|Engineer's}} [[Items#Equipment|equipment]], as well as any items that modify skill slots:
**The {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}} replace the {{Color|engineer|turrets'}} primary attack with {{SkillLink|skillName=Hungering Gaze|survivorName=Heretic}}. This increases their raw damage and proc potential significantly, and also replaces {{Color|engineer|Bouncing Grenades}} with a significantly easier-to-use skill for {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} himself. Curiously, turrets do not have the standard projectile deviation that players have when firing {{Color|heresy|Hungering Gaze}}, making them much more effective.
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Shuriken}} allows the {{Color|engineer|turrets}} to throw shurikens for extra damage and range. This also gives them an easy way to activate {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band|altText=Kjaro's}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band|altText=Runald's}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Singularity Band|altText=Singularity Bands}}, giving them a significant damage boost. However, {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} can only fire one Shuriken every time they start firing, significantly limiting its usefulness. This limitation can be circumvented by giving them {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}.
**The {{Color|engineer|turrets}} cannot use their inherited equipment unless it has a passive effect (even with {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}}). Thus the only equipment that have any effect are the {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Array}} and any [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite Equipment]]. {{ItemLink|itemName=Gnarled Woodsprite}}, despite having a passive effect, also does not do anything for the {{Color|engineer|turrets}}.
*The {{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} and {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} have almost identical damage output and proc rate, making on-hit items like the {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}} universally good for both.
*The {{Color|engineer|turrets'}} attacks do not have a specific maximum range. Instead, they have a maximum distance where they will notice and attack an enemy. Notably, the {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} have a much shorter maximum range than the {{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} (likely since the {{Color|engineer|Carbonizer Turrets}} can simply walk closer to their target). This remains true even when their primary attack is replaced by {{Color|heresy|Hungering Gaze}}.
**This is particularly problematic for fighting airbone enemies, as {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} will rarely target them. Most notably; {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} is always too high for them to target, making them unable to fire at it.
*Acquiring a {{ItemLink|itemName=Purity}} will reduce the cooldown of {{Color|engineer|Thermal Harpoons}} (and {{Color|heresy|Hungering Gaze}}) to 0.5s. When using both Purity and Visions of Heresy, the {{Color|engineer|turrets'}} raw damage output is dramatically increased to 4 times their normal amount. However, this sacrifices random chance effects like on-hit items in favor of pure damage.
**{{Color|engineer|Thermal Harpoons}} can be further augmented with {{ItemLink|Pocket I.C.B.M.}}, leading to a huge barrage of harpoons every few seconds.
*Both {{Color|engineer|Pressure Mines}} and {{Color|engineer|Spider Mines}} can be stuck onto the outside surface of the {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}}. {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} are highly useful for both mines.
*Placing {{Color|engineer|Spider Mines}} on elevated positions may allow them to jump onto airborne enemies. They can also be placed onto allies and other Survivors, unlike the immobile {{Color|engineer|Pressure Mines}}.
*Stacking {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} can lead to constant uptime of {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}}, allowing for good cover. It also proves useful to refresh the {{Color|engineer|turrets'}} cooldown, giving the player backups in case one of them gets destroyed.
**Be wary that {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} can pick up ammo packs by walking past them. This may not be an issue if they have Visions of Heresy.
*A single {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}} allows for nearly 100% uptime of {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}}.
*The {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}} can be used to avoid the {{monsterLink|Wandering Vagrant|Wandering Vagrant's}} Genesis Supernova.
*Moving the targeting reticle of {{Color|engineer|Thermal Harpoons}} off of a target resets the lock-on delay, allowing the player to immediately target them again. This means that by swiping the reticle back and forth over a single or multiple targets, the player can lock on much faster.
*Stacking several {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} and placing {{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} beside one another is an effective method for dealing with bosses and high-damage enemies, as it provides a small zone of healing readily defended with the addition of a deployed {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}}. Be wary that melee-oriented monsters may still knock {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} out of the healing radius or the shielded area.
**It is not recommended to pick up {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} if using the Bustling Fungus strategy, as Bustling Fungus heals based on a percentage of max HP (which will become 1). If the player wants to use the Transcendence/{{ItemLink|Aegis}} combo, they should use alternative forms of healing such as {{ItemLink|Leeching Seed}} or {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}.
**Acquiring {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}, {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}, and as many {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} as possible will allow the stationary {{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}} to unleash a constant barrage of attacks, as the player and both their turrets will all heal each other (causing N'Kuhana's Opinion to continuously activate).
** It is not recommended to obtain {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}} if using the {{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}}, as the Weeping Fungus will not activate healing on Engineer’s stationary turrets. {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} do not count as sprinting unless very far away so will also gain little synergy with the weeping fungus, however it is significantly better for the Engineer himself.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Red Whip}} is extremely strong on Engineer as his placement of turrets do not deactivate its buff and he is also still able to fully utilise {{Color|engineer|Thermal Harpoons}} without negating its effects (but ''not'' {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}}), effectively being a permanent speed up so long as the engineer never uses his primary or secondary skills.
*{{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} can block each other's shots if they're placed too close to each other. Careful placement of turrets will maximize damage output and the healing generated by Bustling Fungus.
**A fantastic and consistent placement of turrets is upon the spikes on the Teleporter, as they will be protected from any grounded enemies. There are also some spots on maps where it is possible to place turrets within the terrain, where they will be able to still fire outwards but are unable to be damaged.
*Getting plenty of AoE and/or on-hit items for the player's {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} (like {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}, {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}, {{ItemLink|Sentient Meat Hook}}, etc.) as well as some healing items for the early game (like {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}) will turn them into fairly self-sufficient powerhouses.
*One method to amass large amounts of healing on {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} during mid-game or late-game is to stack {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}} and enough {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} to reach guaranteed critical strike chance, preferably with a {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}} for bonus attack speed. The constant, rapid critical strikes will heal the turrets as long as they have targets to attack.
*Due to the aggressive behavior of {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}}, {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal|altText=Focus Crystals}} might be useful when they haphazardly charge into enemies. The {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}} and a few {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch|altText=Topaz Brooches}} or {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth|altText=Monster Teeth}} can additionally benefit the haphazard behavior of the Carbonizer turrets.
*Both turrets greatly benefit from {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}}, as the 3 second invincibility time will always reset on newly deployed turrets, as long as {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} has not used up his own Dio's Best Friend.
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}} has a similar effect, although it corrupts all possible items into [[Items#Void|void items]]. This is especially pertinent for the aforementioned Bustling Fungus strategy, as they are corrupted into {{ItemLink|itemName=Weeping Fungus}}.
*{{Color|engineer|Engineer}} does not gain gold when his turrets are hit if they have the{{ItemLink|Roll of Pennies|altText=Roll of Pennies}}.
*Both {{Color|engineer|turrets}} benefit from the {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}} and have a good chance of stacking multiple Elite buffs at at time.
**This may backfire upon killing an {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}} enemy, as these Elite buffs replace HP with [[Health#Shield|shields]], making the aforementioned healing strategies less effective (especially the Bustling Fungus strategy).
*{{Color|engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} can be used to press the pressure plates on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]].
**Though {{Color|engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} can activate them as well, these turrets are liable to walk off the pressure plates.
*A very risky but rewarding strategy is to acquire the {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Array}} at the start of a run. Both {{Color|engineer|turrets}} get their own Fuel Array and will explode when sufficiently damaged, dealing huge damage to whatever was attacking them. This requires the player to dodge well enough to avoid exploding themself, however. This strategy is much more viable in multiplayer, as dying from the Fuel Array will not end the run.
*Having a {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} lets {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} deploy 3 {{Color|engineer|turrets}} at a time, instead of 2. Stacking more Lysate Cells will ''not'' further increase the number of {{Color|engineer|turrets}} that can be deployed, but still provides extra charges. This comes at the cost of {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells'}} equipment synergy, however.
*Players should be aware that their {{Color|engineer|turrets'}} kills don't count toward the user's  {{ItemLink|itemName=Infusion}} HP boost. Instead, their boost from the Infusion is always set to 0 when they are deployed, requiring them to each kill 100 enemies to receive the full boost. As a result, the Infusion is generally only useful for {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} himself.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}} will dramatically empower the {{Color|engineer|turrets}}, giving them more attack speed, reduced cooldowns (relevant for {{Color|heresy|Hungering Gaze}}), an extra chain gun attack, and a bonus attack akin to an {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}. However, they will ''not'' summon their own {{EntityLink|entityName=Col. Droneman|altText=Cols. Droneman|altUrl=Spare Drone Parts}}.
*The {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} can be cheesed by placing {{Color|engineer|turrets}} right outside the one-way barrier surrounding the arena. The {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} will aggro onto the turrets, but cannot damage them due to the barrier.
**The boss (and most AI entities in the game) only switches targets whenever their current one is dead or they receive damage from a different entity, so as long as the {{Color|engineer|Engineer}} does not attack Mithrix directly, aggro will not swap between them and their turrets.
==Lore==
{{Lore}}

==Bugs==
*{{Color|engineer|Thermal Harpoons}} will not deactivate {{ItemLink|itemName=Red Whip}}, bizarrely however {{Color|engineer|Bubble Shield}} ''will'' despite the former being a pure offensive skill and the shield's pure defensive status.
*Unlike all other ally generating items,{{ItemLink|itemName=Newly Hatched Zoea}} is not blacklisted for turrets, causing them to spawn more void allies every time they are placed down.
*When playing as a client, painting a target with {{Color|engineer|Thermal Harpoons}} will cause {{Color|heresy|Hungering Gaze}} used by the Engineer to aggressively try to home on to the first target marked, curving at extreme angles from any range. This effect will linger until the target dies.
*{{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret|Engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} are unable to properly utilise {{ItemLink|itemName=Shuriken}}, they will fire a single shot upon firing their laser but will not fire again until they stop attacking and start again. Due to their behaviour this usually makes them unable to fire more than one shuriken at any single target unless they obtain {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}.

==Trivia ==
*The '''Engineer''' was one of the playable characters in the first Risk of Rain.
*Prior to the Anniversary Update, the Engineer's ending phrase was {{Color|#959494|"...and so he left, more steel and circuit than man."}}, reiterating his ending message from [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} by defeating the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]] in less than 5 seconds after it spawns.

==Tips==
The use of {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn|Trophy's Hunter's Tricorn}} makes this challenge trivial by killing the Teleporter Boss in a single hit.

The challenge can be difficult to achieve without planning ahead (unsurprisingly). The following can make it easier to achieve:

*Using a {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} with a lot of on-hit items is a good way to reach enough burst damage to complete this challenge.
*Using burst items like {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} or {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}} in combination with plenty of {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} and {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} or {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}}.
*Using the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} and teaming up with a high damage character such as {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} and/or {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} by recruiting 12 minions and having them all alive simultaneously.

== Tips ==
* "Minions" include [[Interactibles#Drones|drones]], Engineer's {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Turrets}},  Gunner Turrets, Squid Turrets spawned from {{ItemLink|itemName=Squid Polyp}}, ghosts spawned from {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}}, the [[TC-280 Prototype]] and{{EntityLink|Strike Drone|Strike Drones|altUrl=The Back-up}} from {{ItemLink|The Back-up}}.&lt;!-- Do the Beetle Guard from Queen's Gland and the Probes from Empathy Cores count? --&gt;

* Having two {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} allows the player to use three charges of The Back-up in a row, which will summon 12 Strike Drones and immediately complete the challenge.
* Another method of completing the challenge involves the player spawning Squid Turrets using the vending machine spawned by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Remote Caffeinator}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} by finishing charging the [[Teleporter]] with zero [[Monsters]] remaining on the stage.

== Tips ==
* The easy method is to charge the Teleporter to 99% without killing the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], at which point no more monsters will naturally spawn. Kill the remaining monsters then kill the Teleporter Boss to complete the challenge.

* Can be done on [[Prismatic Trial]]s.

      <text bytes="10943" sha1="6qh1k9i00oxconjhkasug0h39ickb7h" xml:space="preserve">'''Environments''' are the playable stages within ''Risk of Rain 2''. Traveling between main environments is done via the [[Teleporter]]. There are currently nine main environments available to be explored. After finishing the fifth environment, the challenge [[Deja Vu?]] is unlocked and the stage sequence loops. It is not possible to visit multiple environments of one stage in a single loop.

Each environment has three or more stage variations, with most changes being single features, such as a door being opened to reveal extended areas. Environments can contain secrets, and hidden treasures.

Hidden realms are environments not accessible through stage loops. These environments usually have requirements that need to be met to be accessed.

==Hidden Realms==
Also known as intermission stages. ''Mysterious places where time seems to stop.''

Environment Logs are found within each Hidden Realm. Upon being picked up, they unlock the Logbook Entry for the corresponding environment. They appear as a small shiny book on the ground in a set location and will always spawn. If you are playing in a group, only one member of the party needs to pick up the log for everyone to get the Logbook Entry.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Looping==
''"Loop" redirects here. For the item, see {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}}.''

Looping occurs after leaving the {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} or the {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} by using the [[Teleporter#Primordial Teleporter|Primordial Teleporter]] in its shifted state, or by exiting through a portal to a Hidden Realm such as [[Bulwark's Ambry]] or the [[Bazaar Between Time]] regardless of the Primordial Teleporter's alignment. Once this is done, the game will loop around to the first Environment set. This repeats infinitely until the player obliterates themselves at the Obelisk in a Celestial Portal, beats the game, or dies.

Once the player loops, several stages will have new enemies spawn on them, these being; 
*{{MonsterLink|Jellyfish}} for {{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}}
*{{MonsterLink|Jellyfish}}, {{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab}}, {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct}} and {{MonsterLink|Xi Construct}} for {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}
*{{MonsterLink|Blind Vermin}} for {{EnvironmentLink|Siphoned Forest}}
*{{MonsterLink|Clay Templar}} and {{MonsterLink|Clay Apothecary}} for {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}
*{{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture}} for {{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}
*{{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}} for {{EnvironmentLink|Siphoned Forest}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}} for all Environments (Except for {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}, where Scavengers can spawn regardless of looping)

Additionally, after looping, monsters can spawn as [[Monsters#Malachite|Malachite]], [[Monsters#Celestine|Celestine]], and [[Monsters#Twisted|Twisted]] Elites.

However, it would be more accurate to say that the game does not have a concept of "looping", but instead counts the number of stages cleared. For example, Malachite and Celestine Elites (Tier 2 Elites) are available for spawning from stage 6 and onwards. In a normal game, that would be the first set of Environments after looping. But visiting the Bulwark's Ambry after Sky Meadow makes this the 6th stage and Tier 2 Elites can spawn there. Additionally, with the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}}, Tier 2 Elites can also spawn on Commencement, since it also counts as the 6th stage.

Another example of this technicality is the Jellyfish spawning on Distant Roost after looping. In actuality, the Jellyfish can spawn on Distant Roost if it is at least the second stage. In a normal game, this can only be observed after looping, but playing in a game mode that selects Distant Roost as other than the first Environment, the Jellyfish would spawn even before "looping".

In summary, all Interactables, Monsters, and Family Events have minimum stage restrictions before they can spawned, which are not accurately tied to the definition of "looping" above.

Doing one full loop completes the challenge [[Deja Vu?]]. This challenge does not simply count reaching stage 6 and it does require you to loop back to the first Environment set.

Unlike most drones that cost [[gold]] to repair, an Equipment Drone is repaired by having the player give it the [[Items#Active Items|equipment]] they currently hold. The drone automatically activates the provided equipment when it sees an enemy, if its equipment is off cooldown. 

Additionally, the Equipment Drone spawns with hidden items that reduce its equipment cooldown to 20.589% of the normal time, allowing it to activate its equipment almost five times as frequently as a player could.

== Skills &amp; Behaviors ==
The Equipment Drone has no skills and its behaviors are exactly the same as those of the {{EntityLink|entityName=Gunner Drone|altUrl=Gunner Drone#Behaviors}}, except that when the Gunner Drone uses its primary, the Equipment Drone activates its equipment.

== Notes ==
* The player cannot exchange the equipped item once it has been used to activate the drone.
* If the drone is destroyed, the equipment it was carrying will be lost. Repairing the drone requires a new equipment item.
* The Equipment Drone can carry and activate any equipment, but has no other items or abilities (aside from its cooldown reduction). Thus, giving it items like {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}, {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}},{{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Ocular HUD}}, {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}}, {{ItemLink|Jade Elephant}} {{ItemLink|itemName=Super Massive Leech}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Foreign Fruit}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Executive Card}} will have little effect. The Equipment Drone also has no gold, so it cannot use {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}}. 
** The {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn|altImg=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed)}} will do nothing besides prompt the Equipment Drone itself to say "Ahoy!" in text chat, which is hilarious and can make long solo runs more interesting.
** If the player has {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}}, the Equipment Drone gains its own weapons. This can result in some previously-useless equipment becoming usable for it. 

== Tips ==
* Equipment that does not require timing or much thought to use are typically better to use with the Equipment Drone. Examples include the {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}}, {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}, {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}}, {{ItemLink|Gorag's Opus}} and {{ItemLink|The Back-up}}.
** Remember that the Equipment Drone does ''not'' benefit from the player's items, so giving up a damaging piece of equipment may be a loss depending on how many items the player has.
** Similarly, if the player has many cooldown-reducing items ({{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Soulbound Catalyst}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}}), it is likely not worth giving up their equipment.
* The Equipment Drone is a good candidate for the {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}}, since the drone uses the ambient run level (not the player's level) and the Tincture deals damage based on the holder's maximum health. The drone is always continually leveling up and increasing its health at the same rate as enemies, meaning it will always deal a respectable amount of damage to monsters even as the run progresses. This strategy does have drawbacks, unsurprisingly:
** Since the drone is always leveling up and dealing more damage with the Tincture, it will also hurt the player much more, as monster level surpasses player level very rapidly. 
** The drone will ''constantly'' be on fire when enemies are nearby (since the Tincture lasts 12 seconds, but the cooldown will be reduced to about 9 seconds), meaning that it will always be at risk of hurting the player. It will also be at extremely low health, since although the Helfire Tincture cannot kill the holder, the drone has no good way to heal and so it will likely be vulnerable to dying to any amount of external damage.
* Another similarly risky but rewarding strategy is giving the Equipment Drone the {{ItemLink|itemName=Glowing Meteorite}}, which will have its cooldown reduced so much that there will only be 8 seconds of downtime between activations. The caveat about the drone's damage continually increasing applies to this strategy as well, making the drone liable to severely hurt or even kill the player late in a run.
* The Equipment Drone is a very good distraction for a mass of enemies if there are extra equipment that the player does not wish to take. Simply putting a piece of equipment on it, no matter how helpful (or unhelpful), will allow it to draw enemies' attention.
*Elite equipment has varying levels of utility when given to the Equipment Drone. While some provide immediate value like {{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Retort}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Spectral Circlet}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=His Reassurance}}, others require {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}} to be put to good use as the provided chain gun and missile attacks will apply the equipment's on-hit effects.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] and where the player starts their journey. Upon beginning a new run, most [[Survivors]] fall from above in their own Escape Pods ({{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}, {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}, and {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} spawn without a Pod, while {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} spawns with a unique Pod). While inside the Escape Pod, players are {{StatusEffectLink|Immune|invulnerable}} to damage. Before gameplay can begin, the Pod must be exited by pressing the interact button, which jettisons the door and allows the Survivor to leave.

On the back of the Escape Pod, the player can interact with a panel to obtain the {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}, a unique piece of [[equipment]]. The Fuel Array is necessary to unlock {{SurvivorLink|REX}} via the [[Power Plant]] [[Challenges|Challenge]].

The '''Essence of Heresy''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2 and a part of the [[Heretic|Heresy Set]], released in the Anniversary Update.

Obtaining the Essence of Heresy will replace the [[Survivors|Survivor's]] special skill ("R" by default on keyboard) with the Ruin skill. 
__TOC__
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{SkillType|Special|
{{Skill
| name     = Ruin
| type     = Special
| cooldown = 8s {{Stack|(+8s per stack)}}
| proc     = 1
| notes    = 
* Multiple enemies can be affected by {{StatusEffectLink|LunarDetonator|Ruin}} simultaneously.
* The chance to inflict Ruin is multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the attack, but it will always last for the full 10 seconds. Damage with a proc coefficient of 0, such as {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding}}, will never add any Ruin.
* All stacks of Ruin are refreshed when a new stack is applied to that target.
* When the skill is activated, one shot is fired at each enemy suffering from Ruin. These shots penetrate terrain, and have a Proc Coefficient of 1.0
* While the skill is on cooldown, the player cannot inflict Ruin on enemies.
* Minions such as [[Interactables|Drones]] will not inflict Ruin.
}}
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Notes ==
* Obtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the {{EntityLink|entityName=Heretic}}.
* With one or more {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell|Lysate Cells}}, then Ruin can still be inflicted as long as at least one charge of it remains. This also means that the shot fired by activating Ruin can inflict another stack of Ruin.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}} has exceptional synergy with this item, as he can easily add stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=LunarDetonator}} with his {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap|survivorName=Commando}} and the fact that Ruin out scales both {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppressive Fire|survivorName=Commando}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Frag Grenade|survivorName=Commando}}.
* {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}, and {{ItemLink|Singularity Band}} work very well with this item, being able to deal considerable extra damage when a large number of ruin stacks are detonated at once.
** Note that if you apply stacks of ruin to multiple enemies and activate the skill, the band activation will only apply to the first enemy hit with the projectiles fired from essence of heresy. If you want to make sure that the bands trigger on the intended enemy, try to focus only on that enemy with your attacks.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

When entering a new stage, there is a 5% (''+5% per stack'') chance for each item generated in the stage to be replaced with a random lunar item instead. This affects items in [[Chests]], [[3D Printers]], [[Void Cradle]]s, [[Void Potential|Void Potential Orbs]], [[Rusted Key|Rusted]]/[[Encrusted Key|Encrusted]] Lockboxes, the [[Teleporter#Drops|Teleporter reward]], and the [[Bazaar Between Time#Cauldrons|Cauldrons]] in the {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time}}. It also affects any item dropped while the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled, and the item dropped when using the {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}}. However, it does ''not'' affect [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] drops.

Eulogy Zero also affects items given to monsters. This applies to the items {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}} spawn with, the items given to monsters from the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}, and the items monsters gain in the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}} and [[Simulacrum]].

==Notes==
*Because items in chests are replaced when the stage is generated, a player who does not have Eulogy Zero may open a chest and find a lunar item if a teammate has Eulogy Zero. The same applies if an item drops from a monster while the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled.
**This also means that, if picking up Eulogy Zero mid-stage from e.g. a [[Lunar Pod]], it will not take effect until the next stage's loot is generated.
*Stage generation is ''not'' affected by [[luck]], and so the Eulogy Zero will not change its item replacement chance with changes in luck.
*A 3D Printer that is affected by Eulogy Zero will print the displayed lunar item, but the rarity of the input item will be as though the printer was unaffected. For instance, a 3D Printer that printed white items but was affected will print 1 white item into the displayed lunar item.
*Eulogy Zero can cause Scavengers to spawn with lunar items, but it does ''not'' affect their scavenging skill that gives them additional items; no matter how many Eulogy Zero the player team has, a Scavenger can never pick up a lunar item after it spawns.
*The loot options generated by a Void Potential roll indepedently for replacement.

==Tips ==
*Eulogy Zero can make it easier to amass huge amounts of lunar items to feed into a [[Cleansing Pool]] to get many {{ItemLink|Pearl|Pearls}} and {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl|Irradiant Pearls}} (especially with the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}}), as the holder will find lunar items in the world naturally without having to pay [[Lunar Coins|lunar coins]] (or can print non-lunar items into lunar items). However, with high stacks of Eulogy Zero, it may be difficult to even get Pearls or Irradiant Pearls out of the Cleansing Pool to begin with, as they may be replaced by lunar items. 
** If the player is lucky enough to find an [[3D Printers#Overgrown 3D Printer|Overgrown 3D Printer]] afterwards, Pearls and Irradiant Pearls can then be converted into high stacks of valuable [[Items#Boss|boss items]].
*Eulogy Zero also makes it easier to find the [[Heretic|Heresy items]], as they can also replace other items.
*Although the chance is small, in scenearios where enemies get items, i.e., {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}, [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]], {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}, or {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}}, it is possible for enemies to gain dangerous lunar items like {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} or {{ItemLink|Egocentrism}}.
**With the Artifact of Evolution and Simulacrum, where item accruement is permanent, it is possible for monsters to gain more stacks of Eulogy Zero, which can have a snowball effect.
*Eulogy Zero cannot replace the items dropped after opening a Scavenger's sack, but it can replace the reward from defeating {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}.
*Due to the scarcity of lunar items in the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]], taking a Eulogy Zero will allow for much easier access to other lunar items. Another benefit is that the void potentials that are dropped as rewards for each of the waves let you choose between three items, letting you ignore possibly detrimental lunar items.
**The player should be mindful that this can result in the enemies gaining Lunar Items, which can be dangerous. If all 4 Heresy Items are collected by the enemy team, then every monster will transform into {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} upon spawning.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

Whenever the holder makes a purchase with [[gold]], 10% of the gold spent on that purchase (rounded down) is returned to the holder after a moment. This effect has a 0.1 second cooldown. In addition, when the holder purchases from a [[Chests#Multishop Terminal|Multishop Terminal]], [[Chests#Equipment Triple Shop|Equipment Triple Shop]], or the shop dropped by the {{ItemLink|Shipping Request Form}}, the other terminals will ''not'' close and will instead remain open for purchase, allowing the cardholder to get all the items from the Multishop.

==Notes==
*Unlike most other equipment, this item cannot be activated manually; instead, its activation is triggered when purchasing something with gold. This matters for the {{ItemLink|War Horn}} and {{ItemLink|Bottled Chaos}}, which will trigger whenever a purchase is made.
*Due to how equipment cooldowns work, the cash-back effect will not work if the Executive Card is picked up while there is a current equipment cooldown from the previously-held equipment. If the holder makes a purchase while the Executive Card is still on cooldown, Multishop Terminals and their variants will close after making a purchase, and they will not get 10% back on the purchase.
** Equipment charges provided by {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|Fuel Cells}} can be used to mitigate this effect, but charges will only be replenished when the cooldown finishes regardless.
**Note that with the Executive Card's cooldown being 0.1 seconds if the player is repeatedly pressing the Interact Key in front of a multishop, it is possible to purchase the second item while the equipment is on cooldown and lose out on the third terminal. Therefore, it is advised to hold down the Interact Key instead, as the frequency with which it registers as pressed will avoid this issue.
*If held by {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} while using {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool}}, the Executive Card ''will not'' function if it is not in MUL-T's active equipment slot.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Beacon: Hacking|altText=Hacking Beacons}} will inherit the equipment's passive effect when he holds it and they will be able to hack and buy all three items of [[Chests#Multishop Terminal|Multishop Terminals]] for free with a single beacon.

== Tips==
*Though it denies the use of more powerful active equipment, this item can drastically increase the amount of items picked up from a stage. The holder is also still free to swap out the Executive Card for a different equipment later in the run, once they are satisfied with their extra items.
**This is especially useful on the fourth and fifth stage environments ({{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}) because Multishop Terminals on those stages are guaranteed to contain [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} items]].
*If the player is holding an Executive Card while the previous equipment is on cooldown, upon the cooldown expiring all the equipment charges will be effectively refreshed as any remaining cooldowns will use the Executive Card's, which is negligible.

      <comment>Firing the laser burst laser does NOT reset it's cooldown, so that was removed. As well as that, the skill does actually pierce as of the latest update. Step of the Brothers no longer cancels Gaze of The Father. Added that False Son's primary does cancel the skill, however it needs to be formatted correctly I believe.</comment>

:''This article is about the playable Survivor. For the boss, see [[False Son (Boss)]]''.
{{SurvivorPage}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the {{SotS}}'''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

He is a slow, close-range warrior with high HP and bonuses for items that boost HP. His Club of the Forsaken and Step of the Brothers can deal large close-range damage, while Lunar Spike and Laser of the Father can pick off enemies at a distance. The trade-off with Lunar Spikes incentivizes reserving spikes for the two slow-charged attacks to increase attack speed and armor for heavy damage, and using the spikes when escaping or recovering health.

He can be unlocked by defeating the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} with a {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}} from {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} in your inventory.

*Newly earned {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes|False Son}} begin as used.
*Due to {{Color|false son|False Son}} starting with 4 {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}}, his base attack speed is 0.8 so that with the bonus it is as close as possible to the starting value of 1.0 of every other survivor and monster.

{{SkillType|Primary|{{Skill

| type          = Primary
| cooldown      = 
| proc          = 1.0
| notes         = 
* Holding down the secondary skill skill replaces the {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}} with an alternative slam attack.
}}
{{Skill
| name          = Club Slam
| type          = Primary
| cooldown      = 
| proc          = 1.0
| notes         = 
*The attack takes 1.5 seconds to fully charge. This scales with attack speed, so for the default 0.96 attack speed the actual duration is 1.5625 seconds.
*If the secondary skill is released before 80% of the attack has been charged, a simple overhead swing is executed instead for 300% damage with a 1.0 proc coefficient.
**This premature attack only occurs if {{Color|false son|False Son}} is grounded. If he is in the air, the attack is cancelled altogether.
*If the attack has been charged for at least 80% of its duration, the club will glow and a blast will be executed. This deals damage equal to &lt;code&gt;baseDamage &amp;sdot; 1500% &amp;sdot; charge + (maxHealth - (baseHealth + levelHealth &amp;sdot; levelsMinusOne) &amp;sdot; 0.01&lt;/code&gt;. {{Color|false son|False Son}} will also only move at 75% speed while in this state.
**The damage modification due to the difference of the base level max health vs actual max health is extremely minimal, since for every 100 points of health missing or added, the damage output is adjusted by 1 hit point.
*The radius of the slam depends on various conditions.
**If {{Color|false|False Son}} is currently grounded, the blast radius is &lt;code&gt;5 &amp;sdot; (charge + 1.55)&lt;/code&gt;.
**If instead he is in the air, he dives to the ground and the blast radius will be &lt;code&gt; 5 &amp;sdot; (charge + 1.25 + timeInAir &amp;sdot; 2)&lt;/code&gt;. If {{Color|false son|False Son}} is in the air for less than 0.5 seconds, i.e., a normal jump, ''timeInAir'' is set to 0.
***{{Color|false son|False Son}} gains fall damage immunity when diving, similar to {{SurvivorLink|Acrid|Acrid's}} utility skill.
*Even though the skill is activated by pressing the secondary skill, the attack is considered a primary attack and as such it can proc {{ItemLink|Luminous Shot}}.

{{SkillType|Secondary|

*This inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} which causes enemies to take +10% more damage and have their healing reduced by 20% for each stack. Lunar Ruin lasts for 5 seconds but new stacks will refresh the duration.
**This means that even with no items, {{Color|false son|False Son}} can constantly stack this debuff as the skill cooldown is 4 seconds (assuming the projectile does not take more than a second to reach the target).
*Unlike the lightning strikes in {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}, this debuff is actually considered a [[Damage#Damage over Time|Damage over Time]] source with 1 damage per stack and a 3-second tick period.
**The tick period is reset every time a new stack is added.
**In the absence of additional applications of the DoT, any accumulated stacks will tick twice. The first time the Lunar Ruin debuff will be present, which effectively increases the damage quadratically the more DoT stacks have been inflicted.
*{{Color|h|Growth}} enhances this skill by granting additional charges the more bonus health {{Color|false son|False Son}} accumulates outside of levelling up. See the [[#Growth|Growth]] section for more details.

**This skill can apply the effect {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} 3 times to 1 enemy, this projectile pierces, calls down a strike on everything it hits, and calls another strike were it lands, causing the debuff when it pierces an enemy, and for each strike that hits an enemy. Because of this, this can deal with large groups of enemies efficiently.

*The attack scans for enemies approximately 8m ahead every 0.1 seconds. If any enemies are detected, an explosion is triggered in a 20m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear falloff]].
**This means the first time an enemy is detected, due to the damage falloff they will not take the full 200% damage. However, {{Color|false son|False Son}} briefly stops travelling when piercing through enemies, so unless he is travelling at extremely high speeds, a second scan will be performed when he's very close to his target if front of him.
*The dash grants {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}} for its duration.

| notes         = 
*The attack takes 2 seconds to fully charge. This scales with attack speed, so for the default 0.96 attack speed the actual value is a little over 2 seconds.
*The damage it deals depends on the duration percent charged for. However, even if released too early, there is a minimum value of 17.5% for the charge, while over 85% it is actually set to 100%.
*The laser suffers from [[Damage#Damage Falloff|default damage falloff]].
*The laser has a base duration of 4 seconds, which is increased based on the number of bonus stocks of {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}} {{Color|h|Growth}} grants. See the [[#Laser of the Father Duration|Growth]] section for more details.
**This is not affected by the bonus stocks from {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}}.
**Charging up the attack does not increase the duration of the attack, only its damage output per tick.
*The laser fires 12 times per second, which is modified by 30% of the difference between {{Color|false son|False Son's}} current attack speed vs his base attack speed, which is 0.8.
**With the default 4 {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}}, his attack speed is 0.96 and therefore he fires 12.048 times per second.
**Items that negatively affect one's attack speed, such as {{ItemLink|Light Flux Pauldron}} and {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction}} also have less of a negative impact due to the 30% coefficient.
**{{Color|note|Bug:}} The bonus firing frequency accumulates with each usage until the game is restarted. If the player uses this skill for a prolonged period of time with a high {{Color|h|Growth}} value, it will eventually have a noticeable effect.
***While the firing frequency is capped at 60 due to the engine running at 60 fps, this would still yield 10500% damage per second.
*Both when charging and firing the laser, {{Color|false son|False Son}} moves at 55% speed.
*One {{Color|false son|Lunar Spike}} stock is regained every second.
**This is not increased with {{Color|h|Growth}} nor does it need the laser to be actively hitting at a target.
*Firing the laser will reset its cooldown, which is relevant when carrying {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell|Lysate Cells}}.
**Additionally, while normally the skill's cooldown begins when the laser ends, with this item the cooldown begins once the laser starts firing instead.
*False Son's primary cancels this skill.

==Behaviors==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

#'''Use secondary''': False Son must be within 15m from his target and have line of sight.
#'''Use special (Laser of the Father) and stop''': False Son must be within 15-45m from his target and have line of sight. This attack is charged for 0.5 seconds.
#'''Use utility''': False Son must be within 5-30m from his target and have line of sight.
#'''Use primary''': False Son must be within 6m from his target. If this skill is continuously selected for long enough, his secondary skill will regain a stock which will allow him to switch to the Club Slam.
#'''Use primary (for Club Slam)''': This has the same conditions as the previous skill and as such it will never be selected. This skill might have been intended as a combo to charge the alternative primary attack, but it isn't necessary as executing the normal primary attack while also attempting to execute the secondary will activate the combo.
#'''Chase''': No requirements.
#'''Use special (Laser Burst)''': False Son must be within 20m from his target and have line of sight. This skill will never be selected as a previous one is always guaranteed to be selected. It's likely its position in the skill priority is accidental and was intended to be higher in the list, just like the default special attack.

==Growth==
Growth is False Son's passive ability to enhance some of his skills based on any bonus health he has acquired compared to his base HP + level HP. Note that this ignores [[Health#Curse|Curse]] effects, such as the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} or the [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 8]] modifier. See how [[Health#Health|health]] is calculated for more details.

This bonus health grants additional stocks of {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} and for each 4 new Lunar Spike stocks, {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} also gains a stock. The calculation for how much health is required for bonus Lunar Spike stocks is nonlinear and involves multiple terms:

&lt;math&gt;bonusHealthRequiredForExtraStock = 15&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;linearIncreasePerStack = 5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;changeThresholdAfterStocks = 6&lt;/math&gt;

For the first 10 stocks {{Color|h|Growth}} requires &lt;math&gt;bonusHealthRequiredForExtra + linearIncreasePerStack \times currentStocks&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., 15 for the first stock, 20 for the second, 25 for the third, etc.

When the 7th stock is acquired, ''changeThresholdAfterStocks'' increases by 10 and triggers a recalculation for ''linearIncreasePerStack''

&lt;math&gt;linearIncreasePerStack = 5 + 5 * \lfloor currentStocks / 10 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

Since at 7 stacks the division is rounded down to 0, the variable does not change. However, at 17 stacks it becomes 10, which affects how much bonus health is required for each new additional stock. This rescaling process continues every 10 stocks.

The following graph and table summarise how {{Color|h|Growth}} increases with bonus health.

==Tips==
*Charge {{Color|false son|Club of the Forsaken}} and {{Color|false son|Laser of the Father}} by holding down the button until a second pulse of light is seen, indicating maximum charge.
*Items that contribute to {{Color|h|Growth}} include: {{ItemLink|itemName=Bison Steak}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Infusion}} ,{{ItemLink|itemName=Prayer Beads}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Titanic Knurl}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Pearl}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Irradiant Pearl}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Stone Flux Pauldron}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Infusion}} does not immediately grant {{Color|h|Growth}}, but as you gain health your {{Color|h|Growth}} will increase.
***This item in particular grants a huge jumpstart in growth even with few stacks. Once monsters are slain and the bonus kicks in, the first maxed stack will net 4 spikes with the following 3 stacks giving you another 2 spikes each, assuming no other HP-increasing items.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Prayer Beads}} grant {{Color|h|Growth}} when removed from a player's inventory, but only if you have sufficient amount of it's buff's stacks.
**Shield does not contribute to {{Color|h|Growth}}, therefore {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Perfected}} completely removes all {{Color|h|Growth}}, with {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overloading}} also having similar effects.
**When active, {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}} allows {{Color|h|Growth}} to increase from the health gained via leveling up despite normally not being able to, as the maximum health bonus provided by {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}} is percentage base and thus scales with level.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Backup Magazine}} can be very useful, as it gives you more charges of {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes|False Son}}, effectively giving you more armor and attack speed, or health regen and move speed in the process.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}} can greatly increase the {{Color|false son|False Son's}} damage, allowing {{Color|false son|Club Slam}} and {{Color|false son|Laser Burst}} to more consistently one-shot enemies. With enough of them, {{Color|false son|Step of the Brothers}} could also be used as a one-shot for lesser enemies.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Luminous Shot}} synergizes very well with shooting some {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}} at an enemy, and then finishing them with a much stronger swing, which is boosted by both the item as well as the increased damage debuff from the {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}}.
*The {{Color|false son|False Son}} does not spawn from an [[Escape Pod]], making him unable to unlock [[Power Plant]] in a single-player run.
*Intentionally not taking items that reduce the cooldown of your secondary ability allows the player to have more control over which buffs they want from {{Color|false son|Lunar Tampering}}. For example, players who use {{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} to boost {{Color|h|Growth}} would generally prefer the speed buff from used spikes over the attack speed and armor buffs from unused spikes.
*{{Color|false son|Lunar Tampering}} makes the {{Color|false son|False Son}} out-heal the suffocating aura of the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} if all spikes are used up.

{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
*False Son
**Added alternate abilities {{SkillLink|Lunar Stakes}} and {{SkillLink|Meridian's Will}}, including Unlock [[Challenges]].
**{{SkillLink|Step of the Brothers}} dash can now be used while using &amp; charging both {{SkillLink|Laser of the Father}} and Club Slam.
**Primary ({{SkillLink|Club of the Forsaken}}) changes:
***Normal swing damage increased to 450%, Charged Slam damage reduced to 1000%.
***Knockback reduced.
***Charged Slam proc coefficient reduced to 1 (was 3.)
***Air-to-Ground Charged Slam increased in speed, increased blast radius and proc coefficient increased from 1 to 1.5 after 0.5 seconds of airtime.
**{{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} changes:
***Ability changed to Agile - can now be used while sprinting.
***Increased damage to 200%.
***Animation and Firing time reduced to enable faster Lunar Spike firing.
**Increased alternate special {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} damage to 1250% (was 1000%) and increased the Lunar Spikes refill to 50% (was 30%).
**Laser Burst also has had its radius increased to be more accurate and impactful.
**Laser Burst’s VFX have also been updated.
**False Son’s starting damage stat decreased from 13 to 12, but scaling stat increased from 2 to 2.4, meaning that at the very start of the game you’ll do slightly less damage, but you’ll get stronger faster as the game progresses.
**The cooldown for {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} has slightly increased from 7 seconds to 8 seconds.
*Bug Fixes
**Fixed issue where {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} (Survivor) {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} would not do damage in multiplayer.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.5]]
*{{SurvivorLink|False Son}} would have trouble using his ‘charged’ attack if your attack speed became extremely high. This has been resolved, so resume printing syringes at your leisure.
----
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
* Added New Survivor: False Son

==Trivia==
*{{Color|false son|False Son}} is the second Survivor in the franchise to be an existing boss in the game, with the first being [[ror: Acrid|Acrid]] in Risk of Rain, and Risk of Rain Returns.
**However, he is the first Survivor in Risk of Rain 2 to not only be a boss, as {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} is not fightable ingame, but also the first in the franchise to be a final boss.
*The {{Color|false son|False Son}} starts with a base armor of 20 and when paired with the maximum amount of {{Color|false son|Lunar Spikes}} this increases to 30. This increases as the max increases.
*Even though his landing animation appears to be him directly falling to the planet without sustaining damage, he still takes fall damage in regular gameplay.
*It is implied that the {{Color|false son|False Son}} is a corrupted protector figure, created by the [[Lemurian]]s in the image of Providence (the final boss of both Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain Returns) using the abandoned tools of Providence after his defeat in the first game.
**The {{Color|false son|False Son}} was created with the help of [[Aurelionite]], who begins to attempt to break free from her prison after [[Mithrix]] is defeated and can no longer keep her contained.
**Before the creation of {{Color|false son|False Son}} could be completed, Mithrix corrupted him. This results in the amalgamation of both gilded-themed and lunar-themed abilities that he displays.
**Information on the origins of the {{Color|false son|False Son}} can be found in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Ffh8jEpL8 Seekers of the Storm - Dev Diary 01].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} by letting {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed|Aurelionite}} kill {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} while he is inflicted with {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}}.

==Tips==
*Waiting until Mithrix is very low on health while Aurelionite is just starting her next attack to use {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} is a consistent way of not kiling him yourself. Having no proc items that can trigger additional attack can prevent from ruining this timing.
**Large quantities of [[Health#Health|items]] that can boost {{Color|h|Growth}}, combined with {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} and the {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band|altText=}}{{ItemLink|Runald's Band|elemental rings}} is a viable method of dealing damage during the earlier phases of the boss fight without relying on proc items such as {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}.
**Since Mithrix is very likely to be targeting Aurelionite and will be walking around her, it is important to always strafe and have line of sight to Mithrix in preparation of landing Lunar Spikes.
*By visiting {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}} multiple times and accumulating {{ItemLink|itemName=Halcyon Seed}} stacks, Aurelionite will be stronger for the final phase leading to a shorter fight where mistakes are less likely to occur.
**Killing Aurelionite with {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} will also give an extra stack.
*{{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}} has the a very high chance of spawning a [[Halcyon Shrine]] which can spawn a Gold Portal. Alternatively, visiting the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}} after each stage increases one's chances of encountering a Seer Station with Gilded Coast as the destination.
**{{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} has a 26% chance of spawning a Halcyon Shrine, which should be preferred over {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} at a Seer Station. However, this implies the player has to [[Environments#Looping|loop]] at least once.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} by reaching {{Color|h|Growth}} level 40. Note that since each Growth level gives an extra {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} stock, the player needs to effectively reach 44 stocks excluding any additional stocks acquired from {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}}.

In order to reach {{Color|h|Growth}} level 40 one requires 8048 bonus [[Health#Health|health]], acquired from various items and buffs.

==Tips==
*While {{ItemLink|Bison Steak}} and {{ItemLink|Infusion}} are the most accessible ways to increase one's health, it requires 322 Bison Steaks alone to acquire the necessary bonus health. Effects that increase health proportionally to the current max help reduce this requirement significantly.
**{{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} doubles the max health, but its effectiveness is relative to the player's level. At level 1 45 stacks are needed to unlock the reach the threshold, while at level 20 only 7. In practice, it is most likely that 2-3 stacks with a combination of other bonus health sources will suffice.
***[[Movement Speed#Increases|Movement speed]] related items are advised to counteract the negative effect of Stone Flux Pauldron.
**{{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} multiplies max health by 1.5, effectively reducing any other requirements by 1/3rd.
*Any [[Items#Elite Equipment|elite equipment]] that convert health to shields, such as {{ItemLink|Silence Between Two Strikes}} and {{ItemLink|Shared Design}}, make it much harder or impossible to build up {{Color|h|Growth}}.
**However, using {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}} does not interfere with this challenge as the buffs gained from killing the respective elites are temporary.

{{MonsterPage|False Son (Boss) (Phase 2)}}
{{MonsterPage|False Son (Boss) (Phase 3)}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an alternate final [[Monsters#Special Bosses|boss]], added in the {{SotS}} ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' expansion. He is encountered at the top of the {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}.

== Environments ==

* {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}

== Description ==
The False Son is a statue made in the image of [[Providence]] by his {{MonsterLink|Lemurian}} followers, given life by {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, and corrupted by {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|Mithrix's}} followers.

== Boss Encounter ==
Upon entering the fight, a fog appears under the arena, teleporting the player back up if they fall off. The battle with the False Son has 3 phases, the first of which starts with an extended arena and further phases remove successive parts of it.

Around the arena various [[Prime Meridian#Aurelionite Geode|Aurelionite Geodes]] can be found, which regenerate every 30 seconds after getting shattered. Up to 4 geodes can be active during the fight based on the current phase. There is one fixed spawn for both the outer and middle rings, while the inner arena has 2 locations randomly selected out of 5 in total.

All minions are inflicted with {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} permanently every 10 seconds, making their survival harder as time goes on.

===Phase 1===
====Primary: Fissure Slam====
The False Son raises his club overhead and after a 0.5 second delay he performs a slam in 0.33 seconds which scales with attack speed. The attack results in two individual hits; a melee one with 300% damage and a blast with 400% damage, both with 1.0 [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. The blast deals damage in a 6m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]]. The blast can also push the target away on the horizontal plane with a force of 4000. Curiously, the blast does not take place when the club hits the ground, but halfway through the swing, approximately 7m high. By not trying to jump away, it is likely one can only be hit by the melee attack of the slam.

The slam also generates 5 fissure columns within 30m of the False Son, primarily trying to target a player per column and the rest placed randomly. These columns move outwards with a speed of 12m/s for 7 seconds and deal 240% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2 once per second. The pillars can be individually blocked by {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds.

====Secondary: Lunar Rain====
The False Son raises his right fist and 7 warning spots are highlighted on the ground around the center of the arena. After 3.5 seconds pillars land on these spots and a blast wave emanates from the False Son which deals 100% damage with no proc coefficient in a 15m radius with no falloff and a force of 10000.

These pillars are 15m tall, which can provide cover from the boss. However, after 21 seconds they begin glowing, signaling a 2-second warning before exploding. The explosion deals 20 damage, scaling with the [[Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]], in a 30m radius with no falloff and a force of 5000 while inflicting the Lunar Ruin [[Damage#Damage over Time|DoT]]. The pillars can also be destroyed, having 75 ''(+22 per level)'' health, but they spawn on the player's team and follow the player level, therefore they can only be destroyed by monsters or with the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}}.

The False Son is locked in this summoning animation for another 1.5 seconds after summoning the pillars, i.e., 5 seconds in total.

This skill has a 20 second cooldown.

====Utility: Corrupted Paths====
The False Son coils his body for 0.8 seconds and then dashes 54m every 0.1 seconds towards the target. Similar to {{SurvivorLink|False Son|False Son's}} {{SkillLink|Step of the Brothers}}, it uses a massive collision box in front of the boss which detects targets ahead of it and creates a blast dealing 200% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a 20m radius with linear falloff. The blast is centered around the False Son, but because the scanning collision box has greater dimensions, the blast will miss the target unless the False Son starts dashing when the target is already close enough.

Upon reaching the target, the False Son transitions immediately to Fissure Slam without the 0.5s wind-up delay. Fissure Slam will be used whether it is currently on cooldown or not. It will try to deduct a charge from the primary skill and put it on cooldown, but if it is already on cooldown, this will have no effect or reset its cooldown. It is likely therefore that Fissure Slam is used twice in quick succession if it has just a few seconds of cooldown left when this skill is activated; once from the utility-primary combo and once from using the primary when ready.

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds and the False Son gains {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}} during the dashing phase.

====Special: Tainted Offering====
The False Son winds his right palm back and fires off 9 projectiles after 0.775 seconds. Both the firing delay and the total attack duration, which is 1.8 seconds, scale with attack speed.

The projectiles are fired in a rhomboid formation which spread out and travel at 65m/s for 3 seconds. Upon impact they deal 200% damage with a 0.5 proc coefficient and inflict the Lunar Rain DoT. Like a shotgun shot at close distance they can be lethal as they can all hit the player, while at longer distances it is likely they all miss. These projectiles can be blocked by {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 6 seconds.

====Behaviors====
#'''Use utility''': the False Son must be within 20-250m away. This behavior is active for 1.2 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row. False Son will refresh its target at the end of this behavior.
#'''Use primary (swat) and chase off nodegraph''': the False Son must be within 25m and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2.6 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use primary (fissure slam) and chase off nodegraph''': same requirements as the previous one.
#'''Use special and strafe''': the False Son must be within 1000m and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 1.8 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use secondary''': the False Son must be within 1000m and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 5 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Chase off nodegraph''': the False Son must be within 5-20m and have line of sight.
#'''Chase sprinting off nodegraph''': the False Son must be at least 20m away and have line of sight.
#'''Chase''': no requirements. False Son will refresh its target at the end of this behavior. This is used when False Son has already acquired a target, but has no line of sight, e.g., the target is hiding behind a pillar. This can be used to prevent False Son from sprinting towards you even when far away.

===Phase 2===
A [[Directors#Continuous|Combat Director]] spawns 5 {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golems}} initially and more throughout the phase occasionally, but only if there are fewer than 5 Stone Golems alive. The False Son also has a new utility skill.

====Utility: Laser Gaze====
The False Son gains {{StatusEffectLink|Armor Boost}} and leaps into the air. After 2.5 seconds he gains {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}} and after 3 more seconds he lands back down at the center of the arena causing a lightning strike explosion in a 12m radius. The lightning strike does 10% of the victim's max health as damage and inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} for 420 seconds. Upon landing he gains {{StatusEffectLink|Armor Boost}} one more time for 1.5 seconds while 5 more lightning strikes hit around him, each having a 6m explosion radius.

Meanwhile, when the False Son leaps, the head of the status in the background starts emiting light and after 4 seconds it fires off a laser for each player for 9 seconds. Each beam starts at the center of the arena and slowly tracks the player for the next 2 seconds after which time it stays locked in and the only way to avoid it is to get behind cover. The laser deals 250% damage every 0.5 seconds, whose base damage is 16 ''(+3.2 per level)'' and scales with the [[Level#Ambient Level|ambient level]]. For the last 2 seconds of the attack the beam retracts back into the statue, so the laser only poses a thread for 5 seconds in total.

With each attack there is a 10% percent chance the damage will be upgraded to also inflict {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 35 seconds.

====Behaviors====
The majority of the behaviors remain the same, with the addition of the new utility skill. However, their order is slightly changed so only the names of the behaviors are listed since their requirements can be assumed to be the same where applicable.

#'''Use primary (fissure slam) and chase off nodegraph'''
#'''Use primary (swat) and chase off nodegraph'''
#'''Use special and stop''': this behavior actually requires Corrupted Paths to be the special skill instead of Tainted Offering and as such will always fail to be selected. This is most likely a bug.
#'''Use secondary'''
#'''Use utility''': the False Son must be within 20-55m and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 6 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Chase off nodegraph'''
#'''Chase sprinting off nodegraph'''
#'''Chase'''

===Phase 3===
Any alive Stone Golems are killed off and no more spawn for this phase, but the lightning strikes that were active before the boss fight make a come back. The False Son upgrades his attacks once more, with an upgraded version of his utility skill and a completely new special skill.

If the player has {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}} in their inventory, the False Son will steal it and summon {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} as an ally for him, a twist from the final phase with {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} where Aurelionite comes to your help. Not only does Aurelionite follow the monster level, but he also gets a special version of [[Difficulty#Unique Scaling|unique scaling]]

&lt;math&gt;health = health \times \mathrm{round}((1 + coeff / 2) \times stacks \times 10) / 10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;damage = damage \times \mathrm{round}((1 + coeff / 8) \times \sqrt{stacks} \times 10) / 10&lt;/math&gt;

where ''stacks'' is the total number of Halcyon Seeds held by the party.

====Utility: Charged Laser Gaze====
This is similar to the attack during phase 2, except that the statue's eye glow blue instead of white and the damage is 400%.

====Special: Prime Devastator====
The False Son hops into the air raising his club and after 2 seconds slams it down, causing an explosion that deals 300% base with a 1.0 proc coefficient in a 10m radius with no falloff. This also sends a homing lightning towards the players which inflicts the {{StatusEffectLink|Disable All Skills}} debuff and lasts for 420 seconds. This attack ignores {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} and {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}}, but it can be blocked with {{ItemLink|Ben's Raincoat}}. If the player is inflicted with it, they will have to use an Aurelionite Geode to cleanse it.

4 orbs of lightning also start orbiting False Son for 6 seconds while spiraling outwards. If they make contact with either the player or any Lunar Rain pillars, they explode dealing 600% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a 20m radius with no falloff.

This skill has a cooldown of 45 seconds.

====Behaviors====
The majority of the behaviors remain the same as in phase 2 with only new the special having its order rearranged.

#'''Use special''': the False Son must be within 1000m. This behavior is active for 5 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use primary (fissure slam) and chase off nodegraph'''
#'''Use primary (swat) and chase off nodegraph'''
#'''Use secondary'''
#'''Use utility''':
#'''Chase off nodegraph'''
#'''Chase sprinting off nodegraph'''
#'''Chase'''

===Aftermath===
Once the False Son is defeated, the storm clears and northern lights can be seen in the sky. However, the fog under the arena persists.

A [[Void Potential]] with the pick up model of an [[Halcyon Shrine#Aurelionite Fragment|Aurelionite Fragment]] is dropped for each player and depending on whether Aurelionite was spawned, the rewards can be:
*Did not spawn: {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} 80%, {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} 20%
*Spawned: {{Color|legendary}} 40%, {{Color|boss|Boss}} 60%

If the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is enabled, a white command cube will be dropped instead whether Aurelionite spawned or not.

Note that Aurelionite does not die when the False Son is killed and the player may have to deal with him separately.

The [[Shrine of Rebirth]] also spawns now and upon interacting with it, the player is given the choice to offer an item to it and end the run, or take the Destination Portal which spawns to its right and continue to a Stage 4 environment.

== Notes ==
*If the player defeats the boss and continues to the next stage while also holding a {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}, Aurelionite will fail to spawn on the next stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] due to a bug. However, this automatically fixes itself for any future stages.

== Tips ==
*In order to cleanse {{StatusEffectLink|Disable All Skills}} in the 3rd phase of the fight, you need to use an Aurelionite Geode. Anticipate this attack by staying near a geode at the beginning of the fight to remove its effect as soon as possible.
**Since it takes 30 seconds for each geode to respawn and there are only 2 available for the final phase, their usage should be limited to the most necessary circumstances, as being hit by the debuff but being unable to remove it for tens of seconds can lead to death.
*Hide behind the broken pillars or the spikes when he starts firing his death beam.
*Invisibility from skills such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Smoke Bomb|survivorName=Bandit}} and items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Old War Stealthkit}} do not stop the tracking of the death beam, or his attack ai in general, which makes getting backstab as bandit difficult.

      <text bytes="2905" sha1="94vkonp26msnctqjxrxuy468z0ft933" xml:space="preserve">A '''Family Event''' is a rare event which has a 2% chance to occur for the entire duration of a typical stage. If the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion is enabled, the chance for a Family Event after looping is approximately 3.92% (half for a normal Family Event and half for a Void Invasion). A Family Event will restrict the kinds of [[monsters]] that can spawn to a specific and limited selection, including monsters spawned by and during the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. The specific pool of monsters is signaled by a line of pink text at the beginning of the stage.

Family Events commonly result in monsters spawning in [[Environments]] they are otherwise unable to spawn in, such as the {{MonsterLink|Grovetender}} spawning in Environments other than {{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}.

{{#invoke:Enemies|BuildFamilyEventTable}}

==Notes== 
*[[Environments#First Stages|Stage 1 Environments]] can only have a Family Event after [[Environments#Looping|looping]] at least once, as Family Events do not happen on stage 1.
*The {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} Family Event can only happen when the player has cleared between 6 and 11 stages, which means this can only occur on the first loop on {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} or {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} and for a short stage window on {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}. As such, this makes it the rarest Family Event for one to encounter.
*The monsters spawned by any Family Event are always spawned on the monster team because of the [[Directors]] that are responsible for spawning regular stage monsters. This includes even {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monsters. On the other hand, monsters spawned via a [[Void Seed]] are always spawned on the void team, so it is possible to even see void monsters being hostile to each other.

==Trivia ==
*The {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} Family Event is the only way to encounter the [[Monsters#Perfected|Perfected]] [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] outside of {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}.
**As such, it is the only way to obtain the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}} outside of Commencement, and getting the Lunar Family event on {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} or {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} is the only way to obtain it on a run that can continue looping.
**However, with the [[Artifacts|Artifact]] of Dissonance active, Perfected Lunar Chimeras can spawn on any stage with Lunar Chimeras.
*Prior to the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, the {{MonsterFamily|Mushrum}} Family Event was the only one to feature a single monster. 
**The Mini Mushrum was simply named "Mushrum" in Risk of Rain 1, which suggests that a larger monster related to it was a planned addition.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by charging a [[Teleporter]] without getting hit.

== Tips ==
* The player only needs to avoid being hit after activating the Teleporter.

* This challenge can be achieved easily in multiplayer. The player(s) who need to complete the challenge can stay inside their [[Escape Pod]]s for the entire stage while the remaining players proceed and charge the Teleporter.

* Playing as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} and keeping {{SkillLink|Bubble Shield|Engineer}} up at all times with the help of items such as {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}, {{ItemLink|Bandolier}}, or {{ItemLink|Alien Head}} can help in completing this challenge. Be sure to keep plenty of {{SkillLink|Pressure Mines|Engineer|Mines}} inside the shield to kill any [[monsters]] that come close.

* Stacking many {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} can greatly help in completing this challenge.

* This challenge can be completed in a [[Prismatic Trial]], as no additional enemies spawn during the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] besides the boss.

* Taking damage while having [[Health#Barrier|barriers]] does ''not'' count as not being hit, so accumulating barriers with {{ItemLink|itemName=Topaz Brooch|altText=Topaz Brooches}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Aegis}} can be a viable strategy.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''.

All damage the holder deals to enemies within 13m is increased by 20% ''(+20% per stack)'', whether direct or indirect. 

== Notes ==
* The Focus Crystal's area of effect is indicated by a red ring on the ground around the holder.
*''All'' damage dealt by the Focus Crystal's holder is increased against nearby enemies, including damage-over-time effects such as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}.
* The multiplier is applied to each hit individually, and [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] items are first calculated without the bonus. For example, assume that the player has 5 Focus Crystals and damages an enemy for 60 damage before accounting for the Focus Crystals. Assuming the enemy is within 13m of the player, the damage is boosted by 100% for 120 points. If this attack then activates an {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, the missile will deal 300% of the base 60 damage, ''not'' the increased 120 damage, for a total of 180 damage. If the missile strikes an enemy within 13m of the player, it will then benefit from the Focus Crystals and deal an increased 360 damage.

== Tips ==

* While this item is extremely powerful for melee [[Survivors]] who reliably fight close to enemies, all Survivors can expect at least some use out of this item.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

It makes [[Teleporter]]s charge 30% (''+30% per stack'') faster, but decreases the charging radius by 50% (''-50% per stack'').

This item affects all holdout zones, including the cells on {{EntityLink|Void Fields}}, the pillars on {{EntityLink|Commencement}}, and the deep void signals on {{EntityLink|Void Locus}}. Every time these zones are deployed, they expand at first to their normal size but then quickly shrink. The Teleporter zone is also colored blue instead of red to indicate that the Focused Convergence is in effect.

In multiplayer, this item stacks based on the total amount held by all players combined (items held by {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets do not count), similar to {{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}}. 

== Notes ==
* The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the few [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] items that {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets will not inherit.
* The maximum effect is achieved after three Focused Convergences are obtained. Any further Focused Convergences do nothing.
* Keep in mind that halving the holdout zone's radius reduces the ground area to a quarter, and the total volume of the zone to an eighth. This makes the drawback of this item much more noticeable than the player might expect.
* This item only affects the Teleporter radius while the holder is alive; if a player holding Focused Convergences dies during the Teleporter Event in a multiplayer game, the Teleporter radius will expand accordingly.
* The Teleporter radius will also change if the item leaves the player's inventory while it's charging, either by it being consumed by {{ItemLink|Egocentrism}} or by trading it in a [[Cleansing Pool]].
*The rescue ship charge rate on Commencement is ''not'' affected by this item.
*The charging zone for Pillars of Soul already become quite small when almost fully charged. They become extremely difficult to charge if the team has multiple stacks of this item.
*This item cannot be obtained in the [[Simulacrum]] mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}.

==Tips== 
* Players at {{entityLink|Eclipse}} level 2 or higher should avoid this item, since Eclipse will already reduce the Teleporter radius by half.

==Math==
The minimum charge time is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;90 / (1 + 0.3 &amp;sdot; amount)&lt;/code&gt;

The zone size is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;1 / (2 &amp;sdot; amount)&lt;/code&gt;

==Trivia==
*This item is based off of a fan-made idea with a similar effect. The idea received critical acclaim in the official RoR2 Discord for streamlining gameplay by reducing the wait time, while also making the Teleporter Event more engaging, which a lot of players wanted for a while.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Foreign Fruit|returning]] [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

Activating the Foreign Fruit immediately heals the holder for 50% of their maximum health.

== Tips ==
* Combining the Foreign Fruit with a {{ItemLink|itemName=Rejuvenation Rack}} allows the player to instantly recover all their health.
** The same can be done with a {{ItemLink|itemName=Corpsebloom}}, but it will take 10 seconds to finish healing.

* Avoid this equipment if using the {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}}, as the heal will not benefit [[Health#Shield|shields]] in any way.

* With enough stacks of {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}} and/or {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, the player can rapidly and continuously heal.
** This equipment already pairs well with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Aegis}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Opinion}}, but becomes even more effective when using this strategy.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, the player throws a doll in front of them. This doll triggers all [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill effect items]] the player has, as if the player had killed an enemy where the doll landed. It does this once per second and eight times in total.

== Notes ==
* Each player can have up to 3 dolls active at once, and the equipment cannot be activated again until one of the dolls is used up.
** This is due to the fact that if the player had a {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst}} and a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}}, the Forgive Me Please will activate the Soulbound Catalyst, reducing its own cooldown enough to automatically spawn another doll.  This limit was added since this would escalate to the point where there would be enough dolls and on-kill effects to overload and crash the game.

* The {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst}} pairs excellently with the Forgive Me Please, where 1 doll reduces the equipment's cooldown by 32 seconds over its 8 second activation period. This creates a 5-second downtime between spawning dolls. Any kills caused by the activated effects of the doll will further reduce this cooldown, even possibly causing the equipment to finish recharging before the current doll expires.

* The Forgive Me Please has a chance to drop [[Lunar Coins]].
** Since Lunar Coins can activate the pressure plates on {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}, placing the equipment on top of them provides a way, albeit inconsistent and time-consuming, to activate the plates if the player lacks any other resources.

* On-kill effects that have specific activation conditions will ''not'' be activated by Forgive Me Please. These items are: {{ItemLink|Brainstalks}},  {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}}, {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}, {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}}, and {{ItemLink|Defense Nucleus}}.
** Brainstalks, Wake of Vultures, and Defense Nucleus will not activate even if the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} is active.

* The Forgive Me Please will charge {{ItemLink|Infusion|altText=Infusions}} and the {{ItemLink|Resonance Disc}}.
*The Forgive Me Please will stick to whatever surface it lands on. This is useful for placing it on an enemy, or an ally surrounded by enemies, as any on-kill effects will consistently hit the target.
*The versability of Forgive Me Please means it can instantly wipe out the monsters with {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} and {{ItemLink|Ceremonial Dagger}} if the player can create powerful proc chains (most easily achieved when [[Environments#Looping|looping]]), provide permanent [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] with {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}}, and even healing with {{ItemLink|Interstellar Desk Plant}} and {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}.

==Trivia==
*The Forgive Me Please is likely a reference to an item featured in the original Risk of Rain, the [[ror:Crudely Drawn Buddy|Crudely Drawn Buddy]]. Upon using the Crudely Drawn Buddy, a decoy doll appears, which attracts the attention of [[monsters]] for several seconds. 
**The Crudely Drawn Buddy doll takes on the appearance of any [[Survivors|survivor]] who activates it, whereas the doll dropped by Forgive Me Please only resembles the {{SurvivorLink|Commando}}.

The '''Frost Relic''' is a [[Ror:Frost Relic|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

As the holder kills enemies, an ice storm builds up in a sphere around them. The ice storm deals 300% damage every 0.25 seconds with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2, as well as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80|altText=slowing}} all enemies hit. The radius of the storm starts at 8m and increases by 2m per kill, up to a maximum of 18m (''+12m per stack''). 

==Tips==

*The Frost Relic cannot [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically strike]].
*This item can usually be overlooked by most ranged classes, but it can be very useful to pick up as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} or {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}. The radius is fairly small and is essentially a direct upgrade to melee DPS.
*Pair the Frost Relic with {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal|altText=Focus Crystals|alt=}} to further increase its already high damage.
* Destroying clay pots and explosive barrels will build up the ice storm.
**This can be a double-edged sword, as the ice storm will also destroy these objects. If players are not careful, they may end up taking heavy damage or dying.
*Many Frost Relic stacks might not be beneficial, as it is often impossible to kill enemies fast enough to benefit from them.
*The {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} will charge the ice storm when active.
*The Frost Relic is especially effective when the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, as there will be twice as many enemies to kill with only half the health.
*If the{{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is enabled, the Frost Relic's ice storm will ''not'' hurt the holder.
*Frost Relic's zoom out can be misleading as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} while scoped in with {{SkillLink|skillName=M99 Sniper}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=HH44 Marksman}}, as the bullet fired will be fired from its original position. See the [[Frost Relic#Gallery|gallery]] for details.
*This item can stay active while intangible using  {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}} ({{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}}).

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a single-use [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''.

It can only be obtained during the first stage, by interacting with a hatch on the back of the [[Escape Pod]] that the player spawns from.

Unlike most other equipment, the Fuel Array ''cannot'' be activated normally. Instead, it ''automatically'' activates if the holder falls to 50% of their maximum health. When this happens, the Fuel Array triggers a 30m explosion that deals severe fixed damage after  3 seconds; any entity in range of the explosion are damaged for 300% of the holder's maximum health and suffer heavy knockback. This explosion has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.0 and cannot [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically strike]].

When the Fuel Array is activated and explodes, it is destroyed and removed from the player's inventory, regardless of any {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} they have.

The main purpose of the Fuel Array is for repairing the [[Abyssal Depths#Broken REX|broken robot]] in {{EntityLink|entityName=Abyssal Depths}}. If the player interacts with the robot while they have a Fuel Array equipped, it will clear the [[Power Plant]] challenge and unlock {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} as a playable [[Survivors|Survivor]]. This will also remove the Fuel Array from the player's inventory.

== Notes ==
* The Fuel Array ''cannot'' be selected from {{ArtifactLink|Command|Orange Command Essence}}.
* The Fuel Array's explosion will damage any entity within its radius.
* The damage dealt by the explosion is &lt;code&gt;3 &amp;sdot; (maxHealth + maxShields)&lt;/code&gt; . This ''can'' be reduced with [[armor]]. 
** With sufficient [[Health#Barrier|barriers]], {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} can survive the blast while in {{SkillLink|skillName=Transport Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}} can use {{SkillLink|skillName=Blinding Assault|survivorName=Mercenary}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Eviscerate|survivorName=Mercenary}} to become {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HiddenInvincibility|altText=invincible}} and take no damage from the explosion.
* Obtaining the {{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}} gives the player access to the powerful{{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic|altText=Shadowfade|altUrl=Strides of Heresy}} skill, which makes them completely invulnerable. This is helpful for avoiding damage and healing to keep the Fuel Array from exploding, or for staying alive if it does explode.
* Since the Fuel Array will explode when the player falls under half health, things like fall damage, {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}} lasers, and other high instant-damage sources are much more dangerous than normal. 
* Activating a Shrine of Blood with the Fuel Array equipped is guaranteed death, unless the player has built up some extra barriers.
* It is possible for {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} to negate the damage taken from the Fuel Array. Likewise, {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}} can also negate the damage if timed correctly.
* Items and effects that reduce the player's maximum health value will ''not'' cause the Fuel Array to explode, as this is not treated as damage dealt.
** These are the{{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PermanentCurse}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}, {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}} are unable to obtain the Fuel Array in a single-player run, as they do not begin runs in an Escape Pod.
* If MUL-T is below 50% health and {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool|survivorName=MUL-T|altText=switches}} to the equipment slot containing the Fuel Array, this will instantly begin the countdown. This ''can'' be stopped by switching back to the other equipment slot, as long as that other slot is not another Fuel Array.
* In multiplayer, it is possible to obtain multiple Fuel Arrays, though this can only be done by having another player drop theirs by exchanging it with another equipment item.
* In multiplayer, if one player uses the Fuel Array to repair REX, only that player will complete the Power Plant challenge, and thus only that player will unlock REX.
** It is possible for multiple players to repair REX with their own individual Fuel Arrays in the same session.
* If given to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}}, the Fuel Array will become unusable, and is impossible to recover when the drone dies.
* If an another equipment is first picked up, and then swapped with the Fuel Array while it is still in the Escape Pod, then the other equipment item's display model will take the Fuel Array's place in the pod.

== Tips ==
* The Fuel Array's explosion does ''not'' bypass [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]], so it can theoretically be weaponized to deal massive area damage if the player's one-shot protection becomes active. This can only be done with large amounts of healing, however, since the player will need to recover at least 40% of their health before the Fuel Array explodes.
** The {{ItemLink|itemName=Medkit}} is triggered only 2 seconds after taking damage while the explosion countdown is 3 seconds.
** The {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}} heals 75% of the player's health if they have fallen below 25%. Therefore, if the player falls just below 50% to trigger the countdown, they may be incentivized to intentionally take further damage to activate the effect. However, the player cannot fall below 15% health in attempting to trigger this item, as they will not recover sufficient health to then activate the one-shot protection.
* When carrying the Fuel Array, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Old War Stealthkit}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Genesis Loop}} become nearly useless, as falling below 50% health leads to almost-certain death. However, this also means that the player will always benefit from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} can make excellent use of the Fuel Array's volatile nature, as his {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|survivorName=Engineer|altText=turrets}} will also have their own Fuel Arrays. While this does cut their lifespan short, they will explode when sufficiently damaged and inflict colossal damage on any enemies nearby.
** This is especially effective when using Engineer's {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret|survivorName=Engineer|altText=TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}}, which will charge straight towards enemies.
** This strategy is much more feasible in multiplayer runs than singleplayer, as dying from the Fuel Array will not immediately end the run.

The '''Fuel Cell''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The item grants an 1 ''(+1 per stack)'' additional [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] charge per stack, and reduces equipment cooldown by 15% ''(+15% per stack)''.

This item stacks [[Item Stacking#Linear Stacking|linearly]] with additional equipment charges, and [[Item Stacking#Exponential Stacking|exponentially]] with equipment cooldown.

== Notes ==
* The maximum amount of possible equipment charges is 255, with 254 Fuel Cells.
* If extra equipment charges are ready and then the player loses Fuel Cells (e.g. by using a [[Scrapper]]), the extra charges will remain until used up. However, those extra charges will not recharge once used, unless the player collects more Fuel Cells again.
* Due to some equipments like {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}} and {{ItemLink|Executive Card}} not activating like other equipments, the Fuel Cell is of little to no use with them.

==Math==
The equipment cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;cooldown * (1 - 0.15) ^ amount&lt;/code&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Gasoline|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When the holder kills an enemy, it explodes in a burst of flame, dealing 150% damage to all enemies within 12m (''+4m per stack'') and{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=igniting}} them for 3 seconds ''(+1.5 seconds per stack)'', dealing 150% ''(+75% per stack)'' extra damage over the entire burn duration. 

== Tips ==
* The{{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} works well with this item, providing moderate damage over time in an area.
* While generally outclassed by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}}, both the Gasoline and the Will-o'-the-wisp can work together to provide reliable area of affect damage.
** It is worth noting that Gasoline contributes to the {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}}, while the Will-o'-the-wisp does not.
** The blast radius for Gasoline increases at a greater rate with additional stacks and has no delay to dealing damage when it triggers, making this an effective item to clear large groups of enemies.
** Gasoline works with {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}}, while {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} does not.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]'', dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Wandering Vagrant}}.

If the holder falls to 25% of their max health or less, they create a 100m explosion that inflicts 6000% damage on any enemies in the vicinity, similar to the Vagrants' signature supernova attack. This explosion has a short charging period, which decreases with increased attack speed.

The player can only explode once every 15 seconds, though this cooldown period is reduced by having more Genesis Loops. If the player happens to still be below 25% health when this cooldown is finished, they will immediately prepare to explode again, even if they have not taken damage recently.

The explosion has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of 30s (-50% per stack) is incorrect.
*The [[Survivors|Survivor's]] model will visibly crackle with electricity when the Genesis Loop is fully charged.
*The 25% HP threshold is calculated using maximum HP plus maximum [[Health#Shield|shield]]. For instance, if the player has 750 max HP and 250 max shield, the Genesis Loop will trigger when they reach 250 HP.

== Tips ==
* While the explosion is charging, the player should try to find the best place to explode and damage the most possible enemies.
** The {{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit}} makes this easier, since both items are triggered by taking extensive damage and the Stealthkit grants increased movement speed.

* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} makes excellent use of this item, as his turrets are expendable enough to reliably trigger the explosion without putting Engineer himself in peril.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX|altText=REX's}} self-damaging abilities make activating the Genesis Loop much easier, and since they can rapidly recover health they can recover from peril safely.
*By paying the second or third offering at a [[Shrine of Blood]], the player can take a fixed amount of damage and explode on demand, without needing to risk taking damage from enemies.
*By obtaining 38 stacks of {{ItemLink|Personal Shield Generator}}, and making sure their shield never regenerates, the player can stay permanently below the detonation threshold, though this many stacks of Personal Shield Generator may be difficult to obtain in a normal run.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}} triggers simultaneously with the Genesis Loop and does not prevent the explosion from going off, healing the player immediately once they reach the threshold to activate the Genesis Loop. This makes it considerably safer to activate, although this is limited by how many Power Elixirs the player has.
** This is the only way for the explosion to get the bonus damage from {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch}}, as without a {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}} all Watches will be broken when the explosion starts.

== Math ==
The cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;30 / (amount + 1)&lt;/code&gt;

The full time between blasts is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;30 / (amount + 1) + 3 / attackSpeed + 2&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;30 / (amount + 1)&lt;/code&gt; is the recharge time, after detonation.
* &lt;code&gt;3 / attackSpeed&lt;/code&gt; is the charge time, after the Genesis Loop activates but before detonation.
* &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; is the detonation duration.

** Uniquely, this boss item was an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] instead of a regular item. When activated, it would summon multiple homing orbs in the same way that Vagrants do.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar Items|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The first Gesture of the Drowned reduces the holder's [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] cooldown by half, but activates it as soon as it is ready. 

Subsequent Gestures reduce equipment cooldown by 15% each, the same amount as a {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}}.

== Math ==
The equipment cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;cooldown &amp;sdot; 0.5 &amp;sdot; (1 - 0.15) ^ (amount - 1)&lt;/code&gt;

* If the player has any {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, add that amount to the amount of Gestures of the Drowned (as long as the player has at least one Gesture).

== Interactions ==
* Only {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} active equipment will be activated by this item. The secondary equipment will not be used until it is swapped to via {{SkillLink|Retool|MUL-T}}. This can be exploited to avoid the automatic activation for certain items, such as the {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}}.

* Despite inheriting any held equipment, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets will not activate any equipment even under the effects of this item.

* {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} will not fire unless it has a target.
**If multiple charges are stored with {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, all charges will be rapidly used back-to-back when a target is acquired.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} also will not fire unless it has a valid target.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed)}} will be rapidly used, filling the chat with text messages. This may obscure helpful information, such as when teammates ping valuable information.

* {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}} will always be active, making it difficult to purchase items, since any [[gold]] the player collects will be immediately consumed. 
**In later stages this is generally a non-issue, since enemies will drop much more gold than The Crowdfunder will consume.
**Enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} also removes this issue, since the player will not have to spend gold for [[chests]].

* In conjunction with enough Fuel Cells and/or additional Gestures (or {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst|altText=Soulbound Catalysts}} and enough kills before the effect expires), it is possible to keep certain item or equipment buffs active continuously.
** This includes {{ItemLink|War Horn}}, {{ItemLink|Gorag's Opus}}, {{ItemLink|Jade Elephant}}, {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}, {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD}}, {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}} (for [[interactables]] within range), {{ItemLink|Super Massive Leech}}, {{ItemLink|The Back-up}} (multiple uses stack), {{ItemLink|Glowing Meteorite}} (multiple uses stack), {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}, and {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} (since the effect will never end, the player will never be afflicted with Tonic Afflictions, until they swap equipment).
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Executive Card}} can not be activated by the Gesture of the Drowned, due to it activating automatically upon purchase.
* {{ItemLink|Bottled Chaos}} can be quite problematic with Gesture of the Drowned due to possibly activating the {{ItemLink|Volcanic Egg}} effect at a bad time.

== Trivia ==
* The item being a nautilus shell and the item's title containing "Drowned" could possibly be a reference to a challenge from the original Risk of Rain, "Sleepin' With The..." in which the player had to kill 20 [[Ror:Whorl|Whorls]] by drowning them. Additionally, to "drown" the Whorls, the player needed to knock them off of cliffs. The unlock requirement for this item requires the player to do the same to 20 Hermit Crabs, another shelled creature.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

When the holder kills an enemy, there is a 4% ''(+4% per stack)'' chance for that enemy to drop a gold nugget. Picking up the gold nugget awards the player with [[gold]] equal to the value of one [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]]. 

== Notes ==
* The gold from nuggets is awarded to all players.

* Unlike the on-kill drops from the {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} and {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}, gold nuggets do not always gravitate towards the player as they approach.
** Gold nuggets also never despawn, unlike the ammo boxes and healing orbs. 

* The infinitely respawning, destructible rocks in [[Sky Meadow]] can drop treasures.
** The same is true for the clay pots in [[Abandoned Aqueduct]] and the exploding barrels on [[Rallypoint Delta]], although these objects are significantly more dangerous.

* The chance to drop a gold nugget is affected by [[57 Leaf Clover|Luck]].

* The effective stacking limit is 25, for a 100% chance to drop gold.
* If a Monster activates its own Ghor's Tome you will not be able to collect it, and even if the monster collects it, you will not get more money from killing it.

== Tips ==
* This item is significantly less helpful if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is active, as almost all uses for gold are no longer present.

* Activating {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} with a Ghor's Tome can drop up to 8 gold nuggets.

* If gold nuggets are left by the Teleporter after the boss is defeated and the stage has already been looted, you can pick up nuggets right before being transported by the portal, and the gold will transfer to the next stage.

== Trivia ==
* The item is named after Jeffrey "Ghor" Hunt, main programmer for Hopoo Games.
* Ghor is the name of a bounty hunter in ''Metroid Prime 3: Corruption''.
* Ghor has stated that the item was based off of alchemy, and that this being his item was only in name. Its original name was going to be "Alchemist's Tome."

'''Gilded Coast''' is a Hidden Realm [[Environments|Environment]] that can be reached when the player enters a [[Gilded Coast#Gold Portal|Gold Portal]] spawned by activating an [[Altar of Gold]]. Alternatively, there is a rare chance for Gilded Coast to appear in the [[Bazaar Between Time#Lunar Seer|Lunar Seer]] at the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}}, allowing the player to travel to Gilded Coast as their next stage. The time and difficulty meters are paused while the player is in this map.

This area is where the player fights the boss {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, the Titanic Goldweaver. The main purpose of fighting it is to obtain its [[Items#Boss|boss item]], the {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}.

This is also the location for the [[Blackout]] challenge.

==Interactables==
{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters==
{{MonsterList}}

==Gold Portal==
[[File:Gold Portal.jpg|thumb|A Gold Portal]]
The Gold Portal can spawn by spending money on an [[Altar of Gold]] and then completing the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. 

Alternatively, completing a [[Halcyon Shrine]] on {{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Treeborn Colony}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Golden Dieback}}, or any Stage 4 [[Environments|Environment]] will spawn a Gold Portal upon completion. 

If neither spawns, the Gilded Coast can still be accessed via the [[Bazaar Between Time#Lunar Seer|Lunar Seer]] at the [[Bazaar Between Time]], albeit rarely. 

{{Clear}}
==Halcyon Beacons &amp; Aurelionite==
[[File:Halcyon Beacon.png|thumb|192px|An unactivated Halcyon Beacon]]
Scattered across the map are seven Halcyon Beacons, each costing gold to activate. Halcyon Beacons have a base cost of $25, equal to the cost of a [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]]. This cost scales over time with each stage like all other [[interactables]].

When the fourth Halcyon Beacon is activated, Aurelionite will spawn. While there are any inactive Beacons, Aurelionite is ''invulnerable'' to all damage. After a certain time passes, Aurelionite will deactivate all the Beacons, requiring the player to go through and buy them all again. Because of this, a good strategy is to defeat many [[monsters]] before Aurelionite spawns to save up a lot of gold.

Defeating Aurelionite will reward one Halcyon Seed per player and spawns a Gold Portal, allowing the players to leave the stage. Alternatively, there is a chance that a Green Portal will spawn alongside the Gold Portal, allowing players to take it’s path instead. Although the Green Portal is Guaranteed if Gilded Coasts is Completed As Stage 3, Leading the Survivor into {{EntityLink|entityName=Prime Meridian}}. 

==Chests==
[[File:Gilded Coast - Chests Location.jpg|thumb|Chests Location]]
There are four Small Chests that are guaranteed to spawn in set locations around the map. The costs of these chests scale the same as other levels; however, their costs are not recalculated until the player finishes the next normal stage. This means the cost multiplier carries over after the player leaves Gilded Coast and complete the next area.

One chest will spawn at each end of the half-buried ring structure, and the other two chests will spawn in the water nearby: one behind a tree, the other behind a fallen golem statue.

{{Clear}}
==Logbook Entry==
[[File:Gilded Coast - Environment Log.jpg|thumb|Environment Log location]]
The Environment Log can be found far above the map on one of the chain-linked ring structures that stretches out from the ground. The Log is located at the base of the seventh ring, tucked away near the center where the sixth ring loops over it. 

Unlike most other environment logs, it will not disappear 5 minutes after entering the stage.

A significant amount of mobility is required to reach it; this can be easily accomplished with {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} and {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} with {{SkillLink|Ion Surge|Artificer}}.

{{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} can make the climb with careful use of {{SkillLink|Concussion Device|Railgunner}}, if she positions herself on the inside of the rings and launches herself directly toward the fused links on the side of each ring, and then climbs the outside of the upper half from there. A single {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather}} can provide course correction at the end of each jump, if needed.

==Trivia==
*Along with the four Small Chests there is also a preplaced Gold Chest, just above from where the Environment Log is. However, it is disabled from spawning, but it can be enabled through modding.  It seems the developers initially wanted to entice/reward players by visiting the Gilded Coast at any chance with a guaranteed Legendary item, but this idea was scrapped.

'''Glorious Battle''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by completing a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] with less than 10% [[health]].

==Tips==
* The game checks what percentage of health the player has remaining when the Teleporter Event finishes, not for the entire duration of the Teleporter Event. This means that it is possible for the player to leave the Teleporter radius right before it reaches 100%, then take enough damage via fall damage or allowing enemies to attack them, then re-enter the radius for the challenge.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Glowing Meteorite|returning]] [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, the world darkens for 20 seconds and "meteors" rain down, hurting all characters indiscriminately. Glowing blue rings indicate where the meteors will strike, giving players a chance to navigate through them safely (although the random nature of the strikes means that damage is sometimes unavoidable).  

Each meteorite deals 600% damage to both players and monsters with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0, suffering from [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear damage falloff]]. 

== Notes ==
* No actual projectiles are created by the Glowing Meteorite; instead, the game simply places explosions on the ground near characters. This means that explosions will still spawn inside caves or under ceilings, and {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}} cannot protect the player from meteors.
**When activating the [[Teleporter]], since monster spawns are concentrated inside the Teleporter's radius, nearly all the meteors will fall inside or near the Teleporter. 
* Multiple uses of the Glowing Meteorite (with {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} or sufficient cooldown reduction) stack, causing more meteors to fall.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=ENV Suit|survivorName=Artificer}} makes her jumps much more floaty than other characters', making dodging meteor strikes easier; a full-height jump followed by a hover can easily avoid most meteor strikes that don't land directly on top of her.
** For extra security, Artificer can use {{SkillLink|skillName=Ion Surge|survivorName=}} to fly high above the ground, allowing her to rain down destruction with impunity.
* The {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} can help the player dodge meteor strikes and recover any HP they may have lost. This becomes especially effective when stacking the Strides, enabling the player to spend large amounts of time invulnerable while the meteors fall.
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Soulbound Catalyst}} is particularly effective at recharging the Glowing Meteorite's cooldown, as any kill scored by the meteors will instantly reduce its cooldown. Given the high damage of the meteors and the fact that they attack all across the map, just a single use of the Glowing Meteorite will be almost sure to score several kills. 
* If the player is confident in their ability to navigate the meteors, giving the Glowing Meteorite to an {{EntityLink|entityName=Equipment Drone}} can devastate enemies easily. Due to the Equipment Drone's large cooldown reduction, it will automatically use the Meteorite approximately every 28 seconds. This strategy becomes progressively more dangerous as the run goes on, however, since Equipment Drones use the ambient run level and not the player's level.
** For reference, an Equipment Drone has the same base damage stat as a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Brass Contraption}}, and each meteor strike inflicts ''more'' damage than a single Brass Contraption spike ball (600% versus 500%). In long runs, dying to the Equipment Drone becomes a very real possibility as its stats increase.

== Trivia ==
* The Glowing Meteorite is (currently) the only returning equipment from Risk of Rain 1 that was changed from a [[ror:Glowing Meteorite|regular equipment]] to a [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]].
* Using this equipment in multiplayer can be detrimental to other players without movement options, especially on smaller environments. 
* The Glowing Meteorite can be used to easily (albeit, randomly) complete the Her Concepts challenge, as the only requirement is to destroy the skeleton.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

While the Woodsprite is equipped, the holder will continuously heal for 1.5% of their maximum health per second, unless it is sent to an ally. 

When activated, the Woodsprite will travel to the selected ally (indicated by a green circle around the target) and immediately heal them for 10% of their maximum health, as well as healing them continuously instead of the holder. 

The Woodsprite can only heal one ally at a time, but multiple charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} can redirect the Woodsprite to new targets. 

The holder of the Woodsprite can also target themself, recalling the Woodsprite and healing themself immediately, similarly to the {{ItemLink|Foreign Fruit}}.

== Notes ==
* The player can activate the Woodsprite even while targeting the ally that it is currently accompanying. This will give that ally the instant healing, but it will ''not'' increase the healing over time they receive.
* The Woodsprite's owner can target allies that are behind terrain.
* {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} will not receive healing over time when the Gnarled Woodsprite is switched to the off-hand equipment slot with {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool|survivorName=MUL-T}}.
* If MUL-T sends the Woodsprite to an ally and then uses Retool to swap to the other equipment slot, the Woodsprite will still remain with that ally. When MUL-T switches back to the Woodsprite's slot after sending it, it is immediately recalled.
* If the Woodsprite's owner has sent it to an ally, and that ally dies, the Woodsprite will return to its owner.
* The Gnarled Woodsprite cannot be sent to ghosts from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}}.
* The Woodsprite cannot be sent to an ally that already has a Woodsprite accompanying them (whether their own or sent by another ally).

== Tips ==

* The Gnarled Woodsprite pairs well with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Corpsebloom}}, doubling the healing over time without any worry of reaching the healing cap.
*Due to the Woodsprite's extremely short cooldown (the shortest in the game, tied with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Effigy of Grief}}, and excluding the unusual case of the {{ItemLink|itemName=Executive Card}}) and has no negative effects, it is one of the best equipments in the game for activating {{ItemLink|itemName=Bottled Chaos}}.

'''Going Fast Recommended''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by reaching +300% [[Movement Speed|movespeed]], including sprinting.

== Tips ==
* This can be achieved by having 12 {{ItemLink|Energy Drink|altText=Energy Drinks}}.
* Movement speed can also be increased with {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof|altText=Paul's Goat Hoofs}}, {{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron}}, {{ItemLink|Red Whip|altText=Red Whips}} and a {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}.

      <comment>/* Gold Farming Strategies */</comment>
      <origin>31666</origin>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="3703" sha1="8bouzqlhq1cauqhzbvh5ondibcykjjr" xml:space="preserve">'''Gold''' is a currency found in Risk of Rain 2 that the player uses to buy items from [[Chests]] and [[Shrine of Chance|Shrines of Chance]], as well as activate certain [[interactables]].

Gold is primarily collected by killing enemies, but there are several [[items]] and interactables that can also provide gold.

The following is a complete list of all items and interactables that can be used to obtain gold faster:

* [[Barrel]]s and [[Stalk]]s
* [[Shrine of Blood]]
* [[Shrine of Combat]]
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}}
* {{ItemLink|Ghor's Tome}}
* {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}
* {{ItemLink|Defiant Gouge}}
* 

When the player activates the [[Teleporter]] to leave a stage, all gold collected on that stage will be converted into experience in a rate of 2:1. More specifically, for each player it computes a gold conversion burst of &lt;math&gt;\lceil money / 8 \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, which is then continuously converted to &lt;math&gt;\lfloor burst / 2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;experience and awarded to every player. Due to the round up effect of the burst calculation, the 8th burst will only deduct enough money to reduce it 0. This conversion process lasts for 4.5 seconds, but can be extended if the player receives more money in the meantime. After this process has completed, the player will remain on the stage for another 2 seconds, during which time any gold income will be kept for the next stage.

== Gold Farming Strategies ==
Items effects and interactables aside, how fast the player gains gold is primarily based on monster spawns. The [[Directors]] determine the rate, quality, and gold rewards for every enemy that spawns. See the [[Directors]] page for more detailed information, but the results are summarized below:

Enemies that are spawned before the Survivor first arrives on a stage are worth the least. Counter-intuitively, although monsters spawn fastest during the Teleporter event, those enemies are worth significantly less than enemies that spawn before the Teleporter is activated. This is especially true for the Teleporter boss, who will drop hardly any gold. The most valuable and cost-effective naturally-spawned enemies are therefore the ones that spawn around the Survivor while the Teleporter is inactive. Unnaturally-spawned enemies (like from a [[Shrine of Combat]]) are worth even more, although these may be significantly more challenging to defeat as well.

In conclusion, the most optimal gold-farming strategy is to wait to start the Teleporter until the funding goal is almost met. Starting the Teleporter too soon means the player will have to leave the radius and spend more time farming lower-value enemies, while starting the Teleporter too late will result in too much gold and wasted time.

== Visual Effect==
[[File:Barrel gold coins.png|thumb|Barrel coin visual effects]]
When the player kills a monster or opens a barrel, a visual effect of the reward is depicted by increasingly bigger coin sizes for values of 1, 5, and 25 gold respectively. At 150 it starts displaying gold bars and at 500 money bags.

The Shrine of Blood and the gold nugget from Ghor's Tome do not show this.

The Brittle Crown and Roll of Pennies show 5 coins of value 1 coming out from either the player or the hit monster, irrespective of how much gold the player is about to earn or lose.

==Notes== 
*Monsters that were not interacted with by a Survivor or their minions prior to their death won't give gold.
*Gold from killing enemies and opening barrels is shared between players.
*Gold from the [[Shrine of Blood]], {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, {{ItemLink|Ghor's Tome}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} is ''not'' shared between players.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the variant of [[Treeborn Colony]], one of the 3 stage variants added to the game with the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'', located on [[Petrichor V]], and is found in the first set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

It is only accessible after the first loop.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

When activated, the holder launches a dark blob projectile, which spawns a gummy clone of the holder at the site of impact. This clone's base damage and maximum health are both 300% of the player's. After 30 seconds, the clone will instantly die regardless of its current health, regardless of the healing effects from healing items such as {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} and/or {{ItemLink|Gnarled Woodsprite}}.

== Notes ==
* Gummy clones have the exact same skill loadout as the player who spawned it, and they do ''not'' inherit the player's items. 
* If Goobo Jr. is given to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}}, it will produce a gummy clone of the Equipment Drone, ''not'' the player.
* A gummy clone ''can'' be corrupted by {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}}, except for gummy {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} and {{SurvivorLink|REX}}.
** Additionally, gummy [[MUL-T]] and [[REX]] will benefit from [[Spare Drone Parts]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/riskofrain/comments/18nsw2k/comment/kecx6vr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&lt;/ref&gt;.
* A maximum of 3 gummy clones can be spawned by the holder who spawned them.
** This limit can be bypassed to have multiple gummy clones out at once by spawning a ghost of them with {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}}, however they will still die after 30 seconds regardless.
* The icon in the ally cards (which normally shows their character icon) for the gummy clone is replaced with the icon for the equipment.

== Tips ==
* A gummy {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} will also place gummy turrets, allowing up to 4 turrets per Engineer player (or 5 if the player has at least one {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}}). However, since gummy Engineer has no items, its turrets will not have any either.
** Gummy turrets die after 30 seconds of being spawned. However, their death is independent of the gummy Engineer's death.
*A gummy {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} will aggressively and accurately used charged shots, can fire two in its lifetime, and can crit if the weak point happens to be where the clone tries to aim. This on top of the damage bonus clones receive means that Railgunner clones will always be somewhat effective in combat, at least in the first loop.
*This equipment is useful against [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] 4th phase, allowing him to heavily damage and even kill Mithrix, while player can stay away in safe space during the phase.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, it gives the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TeamWarCry}} buff to all allies (including drones and turrets) for 7 seconds, giving them 50% increased [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] and 100% increased attack speed.

==Tips ==
* Pair the Opus with the {{ItemLink|War Horn}} to get even more attack speed when activating it.
* Since a bonus to attack and move speed is virtually always welcome, obtaining a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} removes the need to micro-manage the equipment and also grants greatly reduced cooldown.
** This is especially nice in multiplayer runs where one player's Gorag's Opus will give all players an occasional buff. Although the Team War Cry buff cannot stack with itself, meaning that multiple players using Gorag's Opus will not provide much, if any, benefit.
* Giving Gorag's Opus to an{{EntityLink|entityName=Equipment Drone}} frees up the player's equipment slot, and the drone's innate cooldown reduction means that it will only need 9 seconds to recharge the Opus.
* The Team War Cry buff does ''not'' stack with the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=WarCryBuff|altText=War Cry}} buff from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Berzerker's Pauldron}}. In fact, the two buffs cannot coexist, so whichever is activated later can overwrite the other.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] added in the ''[[Anniversary Update]]'', and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Parent}} monster family. Being a Boss, the Grandparent may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills and Behavior ==

=== Primary: Rock Throw ===
The Grandparent charges a large rock for 2.3 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and throws it at its target with a speed of 60m/s. Upon impact it deals 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a blast radius of 20m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|sweet spot]] falloff. The rock then splits into 5 smaller rocks that each deal 30% damage in a radius of 3m also with sweet spot falloff. Both the big and small rocks can knock back the player and can also be destroyed by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}. &lt;!-- What is the end lag? --&gt;

This skill has a cooldown of 2 seconds, which begins after the attack is finished.

=== Secondary: Gravity Orb ===
The Grandparent launches an orb at its target after a delay of 1 second (scales with attack speed) which moves at 15m/s and lasts for 10 seconds. Any player caught in its gravity well with a radius of 20m will be pulled toward the orb. This orb (and its gravity well) can pass through all obstacles. Players should avoid being caught by these orbs in certain levels as they can result in being dropped into bottomless pits. The attack has an end lag of 2 seconds, which also scales with attack speed. This orb can also be destroyed by Defensive Microbots.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds, which begins when the skill has finished.

=== Special: Solar Flare ===
The Grandparent prepares a star-like orb above its head for 4 seconds (scales with attack speed) which will be located at an ideal distance of 100m above the Grandparent, but can be lower if any environmental obstacles prevent it. This in turn creates an enormous sphere with a radius of 200m that produces heat for 14 seconds. Any entity (friendly or not) caught in its large area of effect that does not take cover (except for {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Parent|altText=Parents}} and Grandparents) gets a stack of the {{StatusEffectLink|Overheat}} debuff every 0.5s. Each stack of Overheat lasts for 2 seconds, but old stacks are refreshed when a new one is applied. Additionally, if a victim has more than 2 stacks of Overheat, the solar flare inflicts a stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=Burn}} every 0.5s. The damage from this Burn stack is multiplied by (Overheat - 2), with a minimum of 1x. This only affects that added Burn stack; previously-inflicted stacks of Burn are not affected. After expiration there will be an end lag of 2 seconds which scales with attack speed.

This skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Rotate to target (priority)''': no requirements, but this behavior cannot be chosen twice in a row. As a result, it will be the Grantparent's initial behavior and it will alternate it between using other skills. This behavior lasts for 4 seconds, so if the Grandparent is already looking at the player, it will appear idle.
# '''Use special''': the Grandparent must be within 300m of its target and have less than 50% health. This behavior lasts for 20 seconds, even if the Grandparent has sufficient attack speed to make the attack last less.
# '''Use secondary''': no requirements, other than the skill being off cooldown.
# '''Use primary''': the Grandparent must be within 300m of its target.
# '''Rotate to target''': no requirements. Similar to the priority version, this also lasts for 4 seconds. Whenever this behavior is selected, the Grantparent will next rotate again with the priority version which gives the player a lot of downtime to deal damage.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Planula]]''

If the Grandparent is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Grandparent) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the  {{ItemLink|Planula}}.

== Tips ==
* The Grandparent's spawn animation will launch players within it at a high velocity, in most cases off the map, so be careful when it is spawning. Being launched can result in severe fall damage or flying into the path of enemy attacks.
* Solar Flare is the Grandparent's deadliest attack by far. Since it can only use it below 50% health, the player should focus on killing Grandparents one at a time if there are multiple present.
* It may be tempting to fight Grandparents at close range, since they do not move and possess no melee attacks. However, Rock Throw and Gravity Orb become harder to dodge when near the Grandparent, increasing the likelihood that the player will be knocked away long distances and take heavy fall damage. The Solar Flare also becomes extra-deadly at close range, since it is harder to escape from and inflicts Overheat for a longer duration.
* The Grandparent's Solar Flare attack starts out almost harmless, since Overheat does nothing on its own and the attack does not set the player on fire at first. If they fail to take shelter, however, the player will find that the damage builds up quickly, with every moment spent in the hot zone adding more Burn stacks that are progressively more lethal.
* Remember that in order to take shelter from the Solar Flare, it is necessary to break line of sight with the star high above the Grandparent, ''not'' the Grandparent itself. The attack produces an extremely bright light which does cast shadows, making it easy to see where safe spots are.
* Surprisingly, the Solar Flare can turn the tide of an otherwise losing battle in the player's favor, as long as the player takes shelter. The attack hurts all non-Parent, non-Grandparent entities, so it can rapidly kill off huge numbers of enemies as long as the player has brought the Grandparent below half health.
** Conversely, the Solar Flare attack will deal tremendous damage to allies, potentially managing to destroy almost all drones that the player has.

{{#ev:youtube|7-Pik7kjyEU|||This is how Grandparent originally looked and was only able to be spawned via console commands.}}

== Trivia ==
* Prior to the Anniversary Update, an early version of the Grandparent was left unused within the game code with a vastly different appearance and skill set. It resembled a large, misshapen, two-headed Parent that was partially submerged in the ground. This Grandparent could create teleportation fields to bring the player within striking distance, as well as spawn eggs from which Parents would eventually emerge. It also had a different boss item, the {{ItemLink|Ancestral Incubator}}, which gave the player a chance to spawn one of these eggs to distract enemies and summon allied Parents.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Greater Wisp|returning]] [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2 that is a stronger, green version of the{{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisp}}. It is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Wisp}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Greater Fireballs (Cannons) ===
The Greater Wisp charges two fireballs (one from each hand) for 2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), which travel at 76m/s and disappear after 5 seconds. Each fireball explodes upon impact, dealing 300% with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 7m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear falloff]]. This attack has an end lag of 2 seconds, which also scales with attack speed. 

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary and flee''': the Greater Wisp must be within 15m from its target. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use primary''': the Greater Wisp must be within 15-50m from its target and have line of sight. While the skill can be executed on the move, the Greater Wisp will stop. This behavior will be active for 1 second. As a result, it will look like that upon activating the skill the Greater Wisp will stop for 1 second, after which another behavior will be chosen (since the primary will be on cooldown), during which the monster will move while still charging the attack.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Notes ==
* A Greater Wisp will finish "casting" its fireball even after death, though it will be fired in a random direction.
* If the Greater Wisp is stunned while casting its fireballs, it will immediately interrupt it. Comparably, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Brass Contraption}} will still fire its bell balls if it is stunned, shocked, or frozen while casting its attack.

** It can spawn on {{EntityLink|Wetland Aspect}} if the the Wisps' [[Family Events|Family Event]] is underway.
* There is a unused boss, being the [[Ror:Ancient Wisp|Ancient Wisp]] from the first game. It currently has no AI.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (Internally referred to as the Gravekeeper)   is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]'', and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Wisp}} monster family. Being a Boss, Grovetender may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Disciple Swarm ===
The Grovetender creates a swarm of 18 small, purple wisps over 3 seconds that home in on targets. Upon impact or after 20 seconds they explode in a radius of 2 meters with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|no falloff]] damage.  

These projectiles have 20 HP and can be destroyed, activating any [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill effects]] the player has only 10% of the time. They can also be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}. 

Each wisp deals 100% damage and has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. This skill has a cooldown of 7 seconds.

=== Secondary: Scorched Chains ===
The Grovetender charges a shotgun-like spread of 13 chains over 2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), with 1 aimed straight at the player and the rest within a 30° spread. If they hit a target, they will also pull them toward the Grovetender. If a target is pulled into an upwards slope, even a very small one, they will be redirected straight up instead of towards the boss. 

This skill deals 100%, has a proc coefficient of 1.0, a force of -5000, and a cooldown of 1 second.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Chase and use primary''': the Grovetender must be within 76m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Use secondary''': the Grovetender must be with 15-90m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 90% health.
# '''Stand still waiting for cooldown''': the Grovetender must be within 40m from its target and will spend 1.5 seconds before trying another behavior.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Little Disciple]]''

If the Grovetender is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Grovetender) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Little Disciple}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

Each buff the holder has grants a 4% increase to ALL stats for each buff, up to a maximum of 4 ''(+4 per stack)'' buffs.

== Notes== 
*[[Status Effects#Affix|Elite Buffs]] also count towards the activation of Growth Nectar, but any hidden buffs don't.
*{{Color|note|Bug:}} Growth Nectar does increase movement speed, but not acceleration. This creates a slippery effect with your movement. This is noticeable with 2 stacks of Growth Nectar or at high movement speed.
*The buffs granted by this item are multiplicative, not additive, which for the most part means the stat increases are somewhat insignificant unless the player has a high amount of that stat to begin with, for example:
**Critical chance: with 4 buffs, the base 1% critical chance becomes 1.16%, but with 41% critical chance, 4 buffs results in 47.56% critical chance.
**Armor: most survivors in the game have no innate armor, which means this item gives none, but for someone like {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} who has 20 base armor, 4 buffs would increase it to 23.2 which would lead to ~2.5% less damage taken.
**Regeneration: at level 20 most survivors would have 4.8hp/s regeneration rate, with 4 buffs this would result in a 5.57hp/s rate. For comparison, at this level a single {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}} would increase regeneration to 19.4hp/s. A high level survivor was picked for this example as very low level ones would get an even smaller increase without other items.
**Movement speed and attack speed are a bit of an exception: with 4 buffs, the base 7m/s movement speed becomes 8.12m/s which is the equivalent to having two {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}}, whereas for attack speed it would result in an increase to close to what 2 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}s would provide.
**In essence, Nectar Growth requires a varied mix of items/equipments/survivor abilities that grant buffs and additionally items that grant stats directly to have their effect multiplied, as the base increases are quite low by themselves, unlike {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic|Spinel Tonic's}}.
*The increase is critical strike chance is calculated after any other contributions have been converted to critical strike multiplier for {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} while their critical strike chance has been set to 0. As such, this survivor does not gain any benefit for this stat. This may be a bug.

==Tips==
*{{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}, which is another rare item, pairs well with this when [[Environments#Looping|looping]] due to the abundance of [[Monsters#Elites|elite]] monsters.
*Some buffs are guaranteed to always be active, or for the majority of the time when players can consistently avoid damage. Such buffs are integral towards maintaining a high number of active buffs. Such buffs include {{StatusEffectLink|Bandit Skull}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Debuff Immunity}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Extra Life}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Extra Stats On Level Up}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Opal Armor}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Delayed Damage}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Delayed Damage Instance}} {{StatusEffectLink|Safer Spaces Ready}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|Teleport On Low Health}}.
**Saving Grace and Tranquility means {{SurvivorLink|Seeker}} can very easily obtain 2 buffs.
** If the {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} has enough [[Items#Void|void items]] to guarantee always being in Corrupt Mode, {{StatusEffectLink|Void Survivor Corruption}} is another such reliable buff.
*Some buffs are temporarily granted when the player triggers a condition or activates an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]], which can reliably, but only periodically, add extra buffs. Such buffs include {{StatusEffectLink|Elephant Armor Boost}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Full Crit}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Life Steal}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Team War Cry}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Tonic Buff}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|Tesla Field}}.
**Activating any equipment while holding a {{ItemLink|War Horn}} guarantees the buff {{StatusEffectLink|Energized}} upon activation.
**Any combination of {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Soulbound Catalyst}} that makes equipment activation very frequently can make any of the aforementioned buffs a reliable source of stat boosts.
*Certain items and abilities that give the player buffs to show that they are ready, tend to be removed when the player engages in combat, which makes them useless in that context. However, the player can still benefit from these buff when not engaged in combat, e.g., for regen and movement speed. Such buffs include {{StatusEffectLink|Elemental Rings Ready}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Singularity Band Ready}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Shuriken}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Whip Boost}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Cloak}} and {{StatusEffectLink|Cloak Speed}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Interactibles#Drones|drone]] that supports the player with more [[damage]]. 

Once purchased, the Gunner Drone follows the player's [[Survivors|Survivor]] at a close distance and shoots targets. It is possible to repair and utilize more than one Gunner Drone at a time.

In contrast to the {{EntityLink|Gunner Turret}}, the Gunner Drone is non-stationary and deals much less damage.

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Four-Shot Burst ===
The Gunner Drone 4 shots with a 0.15 second delay between shots, each dealing 50% [[damage]] with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second. The skill technically has a 2-second end lag delay, but this can be interrupted by activating the skill again, effectively making it usable once every second.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Stay close to owner''': the Gunner Drone must be more than 60m from its owner, who must be alive. This behavior is active for 3 seconds and the Gunner Drone will refresh its enemy target at the end of it.
# '''Stop''': the Gunner Drone must be more than 60m from its owner, who must be alive. This behavior is active for 1.5 seconds, cannot be selected twice in a row, and the Gunner Drone will refresh its enemy target at the end of it. This is intended as a "soft leash" from its owner so that the Drone will not prioritise staying close to its owner so much and stay potentially close to enemies. However, due to the previous behavior having the same requirements means this will never be chosen.
# '''Approach owner''': the Gunner Drone must be at least 20m away from its owner, who must be alive. The Gunner Drone will refresh its enemy target at the end of it. Since the remaining behaviors are related to attacking enemies, it means the Gunner Drone will only focus on a target as long as it is within 20m from its owner.
# '''Use primary while strafing''': the Gunner Drone must be within 15m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Use primary while chasing''': the Gunner Drone must be within 45m from its target and have line of sight. While being at least 15m away is not technically a requirement, it practically becomes one because the previous behavior would be chosen in such a scenario.
# '''Strafe the owner idly''': the Gunner Drone must be within 20m from its owner, who must be alive. This is effectively used when there are no enemies nearby.
# '''Go to owner when no enemies''': the Gunner Drone must be at least 10m from its owner, who must be alive. The Gunner Drone will refresh its enemy target at the end of it.
# '''Use primary while chasing when the owner is dead''': no requirements.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Interactibles#Drones|drone]] that supports the player with more firepower, at the cost of being unable to move freely. It is possible to bind more than one Gunner Turret to the player's [[Survivors|Survivor]].

As of the Hidden Realms Update, all purchased Gunner Turrets that survive to the end of the stage will also move on to the next one. Upon entering the next stage, their positions are randomly placed somewhere close to the player's spawn point.

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Turret Fire ===
The Gunner Turret fires a bullet every 0.1 seconds, dealing 30% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. It will also push away enemies with a force of 300, which is noticeable against light enemies, such as the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lesser Wisp}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 2 seconds, holds 40 stocks, resets its cooldown upon each activation, and replenishes all stocks when it recharges.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Turret must be within 60m from its target and have line of sight. It will refresh its enemy target at the end of it, which means the Turret will also prioritise the closest enemy as it pushes them away.
# '''Search for target''': no requirements. Effectively an idle state.

{{MonsterPage|Gip}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Gup|returning]] slime [[Monsters|monster]], added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}


==Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Gup/Geep/Gip's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: Spikes===
At close range, the Gup/Geep/Gip attacks by projecting many spikes all over its body, inflicting 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a huge area. The attack animation lasts for 2 seconds, which scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

This skill has a cooldown of 3s. 

===Death: Mitosis===
When a Gup dies, it splits into 2 smaller versions of itself, named {{MonsterLink|Geep}}, which behave otherwise identically to a Gup with half its stats. When a Geep is killed, it splits once again into 2 smaller versions named {{MonsterLink|Gip}}, also with half its stats. The descendants also inherit the equipment of the parent, meaning they will be of the same [[Monsters#Elites|elite]] type.

===Behaviors===

#'''Use primary and chase off nodegraph''': the Gup/Geep/Gip must be within 30/15/7.5m from its target. The primary is not neceessary to be off cooldown.
#'''Chase''': no requirements.

==Notes==

* If a Gup is able to obtain a {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}} or its void counterpart {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}}, it will be revived after dying '''and''' it will split into two Geeps. The Geeps then inherit the items from the Gup '''after''' Dio's Best Friend activates, meaning that they will not revive.
** If a Gup has two Dio's Best Friends, they will pass on one of the Dio's Best Friends to the Geeps, who will then spawn two Gips and get revived. In total, the player would have to defeat 3 Gups, 8 Geeps, and 16 Gips.
* If a Gup or a Geep is instantly killed by a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Jailer}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Devastator}}, or a {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}} proc, it will '''not''' split and spawn Geeps/Gips respectively. This can be counterproductive as the resulting Geeps/Gips' gold/xp reward is lost.
** Falling off the map will not cause the split to occur as well.
* A Geep has half the stats of a Gup, and a Gip has half the stats of a Geep. This also means that a Gip has 1/4th (or 25%) of the stats of a Gup.
** However, their base health regeneration stays the same, and their movement speed is slightly more than half
** Similarly, a Geep awards half the gold of a Gup, and a Gip half of that of a Geep. Both of these values are rounded down. Therefore, killing a Gup and all its descendants awards overall 3 times the gold that killing just a Gup does. However, this does not apply to experience, since the Geeps and Gips award none.
* The hitbox for the Gup's attack is actually a huge cube spanning further than the spikes suggest. This means the Gup can hit much further away at 45-degree angles from itself, even though the monster's shape is round.
* Gup's short spawn animation alongside high range and undodgable melee makes them liable to effectively telefragging players, especially late game leading to unavoidable losses. This is especially problematic for survivors that lack a quick dodge to get away.
* The game director does not take Geeps and Gips into account when spawning Gups, meaning a large wave of them can turn into several times over the normal spawn limits, often leading to huge frame drops or even game crashes. This occurs rather frequently within [[Simulacrum]].
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} cannot consistently punch through a Gup with her {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Gauntlet}} leaving her immediately vulnerable to a counterattack. As a result she has very few ways to damage a Gup without being hit.
* For a period of time Gups could softlock [[Simulacrum]] as the game wouldn't properly register the spawned Geeps/Gips as dead, leading to a game over. This was patched and a failsafe was added. This mostly occured if a Gup fell off the stage.

==Tips==
* Gups move quite slowly and are easy to spot, so keeping distance from a faraway Gup is relatively easy. However, if a Gup spawns close by, getting away unscathed may be difficult due to how large its attack hitbox is.
* While Geeps and Gips have a reduced money pool, killing a full Gup still rewards a huge amount of money compared to any other monster. A single Gup can buy multiple chests in a stage. This is particularly helpful on [[Abyssal Depths]] and [[Sundered Grove]] to afford the legendary chests
** This also means they are a great source of drops for Artifact of Sacrifice or the [[Bulwark's Ambry]], or for combining with {{ItemLink|itemName=Ghor's Tome}} for even more money.
* [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|On-kill items]] are extremely effective against Gups, as when the Gup is killed it creates 2 weaker enemies, which each create 2 even weaker enemies when killed. It is possible to repeatedly trigger items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}} to deal heavy damage to the Geeps and Gips, as well as any enemies in the vicinity.
** [[Ceremonial Dagger]] is especially devastating, as the Geep/Gips also spawn daggers upon their death, resulting in a swarm of daggers that can devastate even large groups of powerful enemies.  

==Lore==

{{VersionHistory|
[[Devotion Update]]

* Geeps and Gips can now spawn independently of a Gup (exclusive to Verdant Falls)

==Trivia==
* Gup first appeared in Risk of Rain, in which it could not be an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]]. This is not the case in Risk of Rain 2.
* Geeps and Gips lack logbook entries, the Gups' entry serving effectively as their own.
* Despite being a late addition to the game, Gup quickly became a mascot of Risk of Rain 2, being used in various memes, promotional images and merchandise.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

As the holder falls, they can "lock on" to the nearest enemy by holding the "interact" key (default "E" on keyboard). This causes them to fall much faster than normal, and when they hit the ground, they create an explosion whose damage and size scale with the distance they fell. The damage dealt ranges from 1000%-10000% in a 5m-100m radius, and the explosion takes 10 seconds (''-50% per stack'') to recharge. 

While the explosive ability is ready, the H3AD-5T v2 also increases the player's jump height.

Additionally, the H3AD-5T v2 negates ''all'' fall damage taken, regardless of whether the explosive ability is ready or not.

== Mechanics ==

* Idle
** While '''idle''', the [interact] button must be held down for at least 0.25 seconds before transitioning to the '''charge''' state.
* Charge:
** While in the '''charge''' state, the input must be held for another 0.6 seconds to enter the '''fall''' state. Letting go will return back to the '''idle''' state. Entering the charge state will decelerate towards 1m/s vertically at an acceleration of 30.
*** Letting go of the input before entering the fall state can be used to extend the distance of some horizontal jumps slightly.
* Fall:
** While in the '''fall''' state, the user will initially fall downwards at 30m/s, with an acceleration at a rate of 100m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a max fall speed of 500m/s. 
** The minimum distance must be greater than the starting position, so the user won't cause the impact while grounded or very close to grounded.
** If there is an enemy below within 300m, then the user will be slowly moved towards its position while falling.
* Impact
** The impact has a minimum damage coefficient of 10 (1000%) and a maximum of 100 (10,000%), with a radius scaling from 5m to 100m. To reach maximum damage, the user must fall for 150m.
** This impact can crit, and knocks enemies back with an outward force of 200 * scalingDamageCoefficient and a vertical force of 2000. This explosion suffers from Sweet Spot falloff.
** This blast has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.
** If the user somehow loses all stacks of H3AD-5T v2 mid-fall, the impact will not occur.
** The user's velocity is set to zero on impact.
** After impact, it transitions to the '''cooldown''' state.

== Tips ==
* This item is highly effective with {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Ion Surge|survivorName=Artificer}}, as she can gain as much height as desired before slamming down, maximizing damage.
**{{SurvivorLink|Loader}} can also make good use of it, by using her grapple and punch to move vertically.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} can use his {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|survivorName=Captain}} to launch himself high into the air, allowing him to slam back down with the H3AD-5T v2. However, he will have very low health afterwards.
* Equipping a {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}, {{ItemLink|Volcanic Egg}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Eccentric Vase}} gives the player  vertical mobility.
*Due to the way collisions work in the game, mobility and movement speed items (particularly the {{ItemLink|itemName=Wax Quail}}) coincide well with H3AD-5T v2. With sufficient horizontal speed, running and jumping into the bottom of a slope will send the player flying into the air, enabling survivors to gain elevation over enemies.
** With some finesse, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Acrid}} can achieve a similar effect by ricocheting off slopes (Mercenary with {{SkillLink|skillName=Whirlwind|survivorName=Mercenary}}, and Acrid with either {{SkillLink|skillName=Caustic Leap|survivorName=Acrid}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Frenzied Leap|survivorName=Acrid}}).
*This item combines well with {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Singularity Band}}, as they are activated when the player deals base damage higher than 400%. H3AD-5T v2 always meets this requirement. Moreover, this has the potential to be the second most powerful damage source of the entire game, making it an ideal match for items based on [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]].
*Because a target is acquired and locked into whenever possible, {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}} is almost always activated. The stacking of crystals alongside {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Armor-Piercing Rounds}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar}} will allow most enemies to be quickly killed.

== Math ==
The cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 10 / x&lt;/math&gt;, with ''x'' being the amount of {{PAGENAME}}.

{{MonsterPage|Aurelionite (Ally)}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]'', dropped by defeating {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} at [[Gilded Coast]].

Upon beginning a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], the player will lose their Halcyon Seed and Aurelionite will spawn as an ally. It will fight for the player until the Teleporter is charged, at which point it will instantly die. The player will retrieve their Halcyon Seed when Aurelionite dies (regardless of whether it died at the end of the Teleporter Event or was killed in some other way). In multiplayer, players who die after Aurelionite is summoned will still recover their Halcyon Seeds when Aurelionite dies.

This item stacks based on the total amount held by all players combined (items held by {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|turrets}} do not count), similarly to the {{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}}. Each Halcyon Seed beyond the first gives Aurelionite additional damage and an additional 100% health.

If the player is fighting the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} and is in phase 4, Aurelionite will spawn and help the player.

==Notes==
*{{color|note|Correction:}} Aurelionite's damage does not simply increase by 50% per stack, instead the damage multiplier is the square root of the amount of stacks you have rounded to the nearest 10%.

* Allied Aurelionite's AI will cause it to behave in a different way than enemy {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|Stone Titans}} and it's{{MonsterLink|Aurelionite|regular counterpart}}, as it will use every ability/attack (sword, eye laser and stone construct) when within range of it's target as if was below 60% HP, even when it is at full health.
* The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the few [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] items that {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets will not inherit.
*If the{{ArtifactLink|Command}} is active when Aurelionite is defeated at Gilded Coast, a Yellow Command Essence will drop, but it will only allow this item to be selected.
*If the{{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, two Aurelionites with half the normal health will spawn at Gilded Coast. However, only one Aurelionite will spawn during Teleporter Events. 
**This makes it possible to obtain up to two additional Halcyon Seeds with the [[Trophy Hunter's Tricorn]]. Since at the end of the battle one Halcyon Seed will always be dropped per player, similar to the reward item of the teleporter event. And since Aurelionite is a target for the Tricorn, every Aurelionite killed by this item will have a 100% chance to drop an extra Halcyon Seed.
***Because of one of the Halcyon Seeds is technically a teleporter reward, this means that even without the Artifact being active, a player can still get an additional Halcyon Seed by killing Aurelionite with the Tricorn.
*If the player damages an allied Aurelionite via items such as {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}, it may attempt to attack them. However, it will not do any damage.
*The {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} has special dialogue if any Halcyon Seeds are brought to the fight. Upon seeing Aurelionite, he exclaims "THE GUARDIAN...? IMPOSSIBLE...!" or "THE WRETCHED GUARDIAN!" If he manages to defeat Aurelionite, he states either "YOU CANNOT DEFY ME, GUARDIAN," or "RETURN TO DIRT, GUARDIAN."
**There's also another special dialogue if it's the [[Heretic]] the one using the Halcyon Seed. Upon Aurelionite spawning he will say "THE HERETIC? THE GUARDIAN? HOW? WHO PULLS YOUR STRINGS, VERMIN?"
* When Aurelionite dies while allied with the player, it has a chance of dropping Aurelionite's [[Lore|Log]].
*Aurelionite can become {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} by a {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}}, which causes it to attack players. This can become a serious problem during Teleporter Events if any Void Infestors are near.
*Be wary of attacking {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|altText=Void Reavers}} that may be near Aurelionite, as it will make no attempt to avoid their death implosion and will be instantly killed.

The '''Halcyon Shrine''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion.

Upon interacting with the shrine, a pillar of stone rises up and the players' [[gold]] is slowly taken away while they are in its vicinity. This gold is used to charge the shrine up, visually indicated by the pillar of stone turning to gold, while {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golems}} periodically spawn around the shrine. Once the Halcyon Shrine is fully charged, or the players interact with it once it has charged at least a minimum percentage, a {{StatusEffectLink|Gilded}} {{MonsterLink|Halcyonite}} will spawn. Defeating the Halcyonite will spawn a number of rewards for each player before opening a portal indicated by the orb orbiting it.

==Mechanics==
===Credits===
The shrine requires 300 gold, scaled by [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty]], in order to fully charge. However, at 75 and 150 it crosses the minimum and medium thresholds, indicated by a visual and auditory effect. Once the minimum threshold has been crossed, the players can "pray" to the shrine by interacting with it again to terminate the charging process.

The shrine drains 1 gold every 0.2 seconds from up to 4 players that are within a 30-meter radius. For a single player it requires 60 seconds to fully charge it.

The [[Directors#The Combat Directors|Combat Director]] related to the shrine has 100 credits, also scaled by difficulty. Once the shrine is activated it spends all of its credits spawning Stone Golems in any required numbers and Elite modifiers. It also spawns another round of Stone Golems with the same number of credits when crossing the minimum and medium thresholds respectively. At a difficulty value of 1 killing all the Stone Golems will net the player 63 gold, or 21% of the total gold required to fully charge the shrine. However, as the difficulty increases the gold earned from the Stone Golems will solely be sufficient to fully pay off the shrine's requirements.

===Halcyonite===
While the {{MonsterLink|Halcyonite}} that spawns is a {{StatusEffectLink|Gilded}} Elite, it does not follow the standard health and damage modifiers. Instead, its bonus stats are calculated based on the gold drained before the Halcyonite is spawned. This means stopping the draining process earlier will reward the player with fewer items, but also an easier Halcyonite fight. Furthermore, since the gold required scales with difficulty, the monster's stats are also affected by it indirectly.

The game starts off by calculating a difficulty level for the encounter, defined as

&lt;math&gt;difficulty = \lfloor goldDrained / 100 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

On stage 1 the max gold required is 300, so this results in a difficulty value of 3. If this value is over 20, it is recalculated to

&lt;math&gt;difficulty = 20 + difficulty / 100&lt;/math&gt;

The Halcyonite's stats are then set according to

&lt;math&gt;health = health \times (1 + round(difficulty \times 0.6 \times 10) / 10)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;damage = damage \times (1 + round(difficulty \times 0.25 \times 10) / 10)&lt;/math&gt;

For a stage 1 Halcyonite in single player this results in 2.8 times the normal health and 1.8 times the damage. The health scaling can rival that of the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], making them equally tanky. However, considering the possible rewards by successfully completing the event and the fact that one can advance to the next stage without doing the Teleporter Event, the Halcyon Shrine can be considered as an alternative, but equally challenging, objective to complete a stage.

==Aurelionite Fragment ==
[[File:Aurelionite Fragment.png|128px|thumb|right|alt=Aurelionite Fragment]]
Once the Halcyonite has been killed, the shrine will drop a reward similar to a [[Void Potential]] for each player, where the higher the charging threshold has been crossed before summoning the Halcyonite, the more items will be available.

The items for any of these choices are selected from two mutually exclusive pools, where pool A are any items in the [[:Category:HalcyoniteShrine Items|HalcyoniteShrine]] category and pool B any items not in that category. The rarity weights for both of the pools are: 

*Common: 60%
*{{Color|Uncommon}}: 35%
*{{Color|Legendary}}: 5%
The rewards for each threshold are summarised as follows
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Threshold!!Number of items!!Can pick||Number of HalcyoniteShrine items
|-
|Minimum ||3||1||1
|-
| Medium||4||2||1
|-
| Maximum||5|| 3||2
|-
|}


If instead the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is enabled, n-2 command cubes will be dropped, where n is the number of item choices for each threshold, i.e., 1 for minimum, 2 for medium, and 3 command cubes for the maxed out threshold. If the shrine has not been fully charged, items from pool A will be selected, else from pool B. While with the Artifact of Command the player can choose any item, whether an item is selected from pool A or pool B affects the rarity distribution due to the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]], which in turn affects how likely a common, {{Color|Uncommon|uncommon}}, or {{Color|Legendary|legendary}} command cube will be dropped.

==Portals ==
The Halcyon Shrine spawns a {{Color|Uncommon|Green Portal}} if the shrine has spawned on any Stage 1, 2, or 3 [[Environments|Environment]] but it is neither {{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}} nor {{EnvironmentLink|Treeborn Colony}}, otherwise it spawns a {{Color|Boss|Gold Portal}}.

===Green Portal===
The Green Portal takes the player to a set of predefined Environments based on the stage it has spawned in. Stage 1 Environments lead to {{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}}, Stage 2 Environments to {{EnvironmentLink|Treeborn Colony}}, and Stage 3 Environments to {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}. Once the portal has been taken, any other Halcyon Shrines that spawn will spawn a Gold portal, allowing the player to acquire {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} on the way to fighting the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|altText=False Son}}. {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}} in this case will also spawn a Green Portal to allow the player to return back to the Colossus Path after this detour, but only if the stage the player has come from is a Stage 1-3.

==Notes==
*The chance for a Halcyon Shrine to spawn on Stage 1 Environments is approximately 95%. This is because the [[Directors#Spawn Cards|spawn card]] for it costs 0 credits and has a fairly high weight. On the other hand, for other Environments it costs 50 credits and has a much lower weight, which leads approximately to a 6%-8% chance, depending on the interactable credits of each stage. On {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} it is 11%, while {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} is an outlier at 27% since the spawn card has a higher weight than usual. This is also the case {{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}} with 13%.
**This makes Reformed Altar and Helminth Hatchery the best Environments for a chance to spawn a Gold Portal, since the [[Altar of Gold]] has a much lower chance of spawning on any stage.
*A viable strategy is to activate the shrine and quickly leave it to farm gold from the high value enemies instead of progressing the shrine.
*If the stage has reached the limit of 40 monsters, the Golems that spawn upon activating the shrine or crossing a gold threshold will not spawn, even if the player later kills any monsters. On the other hand, the Halcyonite ignores this limit and will always spawn.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
* (Undocumented) The Halcyonite's spawn is not blocked anymore if the monster limit has been reached.
----
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
* Added new Shrine: Halcyon Shrine
}}

==Trivia==
*The Halcyon Shrine can only spawn on locations that are marked as "NoCeiling", similar to the survivor pods at the beginning of the game. This along with the scattered pieces around the shrine itself imply that the construct is not native to Petrichor V, but has instead crashed into it.
**The [[Lunar Pod]] is another such interactable that requires the "NoCeiling" flag.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|Monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the {{SotS}}[[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion. They are part of the {{MonsterFamily|Golem}} monster family, but outside of that event they only spawn after [[Mechanics#Looping|looping]]. They also spawn as a {{StatusEffectLink|Gilded}} elite upon the completion of the [[Halcyon Shrine]] event.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}
* At the end of the [[Halcyon Shrine]] event

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Halcyonite's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: Sword Thrust ===
The Halcyonite pulls its right arm back and then thrusts the sword forward dealing 150% with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 while pushing the target away with a force of 2000. The attack has a medium reach forward with 24m. It is also very quick with very little telegraphing, lasting only 1 second and scaling with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds.

===Secondary: Triple Laser Attack===
This is a very similar, but upgraded version of the {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golem's Laser Attack|altUrl=Stone Golem#Secondary: Laser Attack}}, where instead it fires 3 beams in total, one every 0.5 seconds.

While the phase of firing the laser lasts for 2 seconds and it scales with attack speed, it cannot be reduced to less than 1 second even with enough attack speed since all 3 shots are required to be fired.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds, which starts the moment the first laser is fired.

===Utility: Whirlwind===
The Halcyonite hops into the air and after 0.5 seconds it starts spinning its sword. Initially it tries to acquire a target within 100m in front of it and 0.3 seconds after acquisition it starts dash towards the target's position with a speed of 20 m/s. It is important to note the Halcyonite aims for the position of the target when they were marked without tracking their future movement. The Halcyonite will dash for 5 seconds or until it has put the target's current position behind it, i.e. overshot. When either of those two conditions is met, the Halcyonite will decelerate to 0 speed in the span of 1 second at which point the attack ends.

This attack deals 20% base damage every 0.2 seconds with 0 proc coefficient in a 10m radius.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.

=== Special: Sword Swipe===
The Halcyonite raises its sword and performs a downwards swipe dealing 150% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. Similar to the Sword Thrust it has the same duration, but the swipe extends 11m forward and 20m across.

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds.

===Behaviors===
#'''Use special and stop''': the Halcyonite must be within 15m of its target and be looking at it. This behavior lasts for 1.5 seconds. Due to its priority and the skill's short cooldown the Halcyonite will execute this quite frequently if the player stays within range.
# '''Use primary and stop''': the Halcyonite must be within 15-20m from its target and be looking at it. This behavior lasts for 1.5 seconds.
#'''Use utility''': the Halcyonite must be within 20-60m from its target and be looking at it. This behavior lasts for 6 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use secondary and stop''': the Halcyonite must be within 30-120m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior lasts for 5 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row.
#'''Chase sprinting''': no requirements. This behavior lasts for 2 seconds. It also ignores the node graph, following a straight line to the target instead.

==Notes==
*The initial animation of raising the sword for Sword Swipe and Whirlwing is similar except that for the Swipe the tip of the sword glows golden.

== Tips == 
*Unlike most enemies in the game, {{PAGENAME}} does not use nodegraphs at all and will chase the player in a straight line even if it cannot reach them or it would die in the process, so tricking them into getting stuck or falling off a ledge is fairly easy.

==Trivia==
*The root word "halcyon" is an adjective denoting perfection or prosperity, and is a synonym to the adjective form of [[Aurelionite|golden]].
*While the Halcyonite has stats more appropriate for minibosses, in most stages it is categorised as a boss in terms of [[Directors|Spawn Cards]], even though it cannot be chosen as one for the [[Teleporter|Teleporter Event]]. However, since bosses have a lower weight for being spawn this makes its appearance less likely. It is likely this is a miscategorisation.

The '''Happiest Mask''' is a [[Ror:Happiest Mask|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder kills an enemy, there is a 7% chance that a ghost of that enemy will spawn as an ally, with greatly increased attack strength. The chance for this to happen is affected by [[Luck]].

The ghost inherits all behaviors of the original monster. The level of the ghost equals the "ambient" level of the run (the same one enemies use, displayed at the top right on the HUD) or the player team level, whichever is greater.

Ghosts do not take damage through any normal means; instead, their health drops by a fixed percentage every second. Each ghost normally lasts 30 seconds (''+30s per stack''), though this can be prolonged if they are healed.

==Notes==

* When an entity is killed and resurrected as a ghost, it notably keeps all items it previously had. This means that [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]] can be resurrected and keep their Elite status, while with the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} or on [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] they will also keep any enemy items.
* Despite being on the players' team, the ghosts of {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider|Clay Dunestriders}}, {{MonsterLink|Grandparent|Grandparent}}, and {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies may still harm or kill the player with their life-draining tendrils, solar flare, and void implosions, respectively.
* Unlike [[Interactibles#Drones|drones]], ghosts won't travel between stages.
* If a {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen}}, {{MonsterLink|Solus Control Unit}} or the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}} becomes a ghost, any {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards}} or {{MonsterLink|Solus Probe|Solus Probes}} they spawn will not be ghosts, but they will still be allied with the player. This means they can spawn as Elites and will not lose any health over time.
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor}} ghosts will attempt to infest enemies. If successful, their targets will become {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} but remain hostile to the player.
**The Void Infestor's original 30-second lifetime is added to the ghost's lifetime, making Void Infestor ghosts live longer and giving them more opportunities to infest monsters.
*When the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} is enabled, the holder can kill and resurrect an [[Artifacts#Vengeance|Umbra]] as a friendly ghost.
**Likewise, it is possible for an Umbra that holds the Happiest Mask to kill and resurrect a ''player'' as a ghost, which will be hostile towards other players.
**Since the ghost inherits all items, it will also inherit the item that causes Umbras to have special visuals and turn the screen purple. However, on death it will not drop any items, since the death is caused by health degeneration which does not trigger any on kill effects.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is enabled, it is possible for the holder to kill and resurrect an ally, or even themself, as a ghost.
*If a ghost falls off the stage, it respawns in bounds instead of dying.

==Tips==
*Use {{ItemLink|itemName=Gorag's Opus}} to boost the attack speed and move speed of allied ghosts, making them even stronger.
* Keep an eye on the health of allied Clay Dunestriders, Grandparents, and void monsters. These monsters have powerful attacks that deal friendly-fire damage, which will hurt even more than normal since ghosts' stats are much higher than a normal monster's; however, they can only use these attacks after losing enough health. Clay Dunestriders only use their life-draining tendrils below 25% health, Grandparents only use their solar flare below 50%, and void monsters only use their implosion after dying.  
**This is especially pertinent in {{EntityLink|entityName=Eclipse}} mode, since all allies spawn at 50% of their maximum health. This means that Grandparent ghosts will be able to use their solar flare immediately, and Dunestrider and void ghosts will use their dangerous attacks much sooner than normal.
*Since a ghost's lifespan is only limited by time, healing it can give the player a near-permanent and powerful ally. Ghosts can be healed by:
**Collecting {{ItemLink|itemName=Monster Tooth}} orbs or {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Harvest|survivorName=REX}} fruits.
**Being in the range of {{ItemLink|itemName=Bustling Fungus}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Interstellar Desk Plant}}, a [[Shrine of the Woods]], {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Beacon: Healing|survivorName=Captain|altText=healing beacon}}, or an allied {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mini Mushrum}} (likely a ghost itself).
**Being in the [[Teleporter]] radius when a {{ItemLink|itemName=Lepton Daisy}} activates.
**If the ghost had self-healing items before it was resurrected, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Medkit|altText=Medkits}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Leeching Seed|altText=Leeching Seeds}}. This can occur in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}, while the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} is enabled, or if the ghost is a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}}.

}}

==Trivia == 
*A ghost is actually the original [[monsters|monster]] with three special hidden [[items]] equipped. [[HealthDecay|One]] makes its [[health]] deplete over time; ghosts are awarded 30 of these per Happiest Mask the user has. The [[Ghost|second]] makes it appear and behave like a ghost, so that it is invulnerable to normal damage and becomes transparent. The [[BoostDamage|third]] boosts its damage; the ghost is supplied 150 of these.
**Because the time a ghost lasts is tied only to a damage-over-time item it receives, it is possible that {{MonsterLink|Mini Mushrum}} ghosts can survive indefinitely because of their healing ability.
* Because {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altImg=Defensive Microbots (Skill)}} passive grants {{ItemLink|itemName=Defensive Microbots}} to allies with the "mechanical" body tag, if Captain kills and resurrects either {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} as a ghost (via either the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} or {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}}), he will give Defensive Microbots to the ghost.
* As of the [[Devotion Update]] spawning a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lemurian}} ghost is bugged and spawns a {{ArtifactLink|Devotion|Devoted Lemurian}} instead. This is because both entities use the same character internally, but the AI of the Devoted Lemurian comes first due to alphabetical order and is thus selected for the ally. This affects what behaviors the ghost will exhibit, as well as inheriting the ability to persist between stage transitions just like normal [[Interactables#Drones|Drones and Turrets]].
**However, due to health degeneration such ghosts will still eventually die unless any healing options extend their lifetime.

The '''Hardlight Afterburner''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The holder gains an extra 2 (''+2 per stack'') charges of their utility skill, and the cooldown of their utility skill is reduced by 33%.

== Tips ==

* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield|survivorName=Engineer}} can be maintained 100% of the time with the Afterburner's cooldown reduction.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} can stay in the air indefinitely using their utility skills when holding an Afterburner.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}} can do the same with {{SkillLink|skillName=Blink|survivorName=Huntress}}.
* When paired with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}}, the Hardlight Afterburner makes using {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} much easier. With 3 charges, the player can gain up to 9 seconds of invulnerability at a time, depending on how much invulnerable time the situation calls for.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} thrives with this item, as both of his utility abilities are very powerful damage abilities. With a Hardlight Afterburner, Captain can use up to 9 {{SkillLink|skillName=Orbital Probe|survivorName=Captain|altText=Orbital Probes}} or 3 {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|survivorName=Captain|altText=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strikes}} in quick succession, allowing him to concentrate damage on a single target or spread damage across a much wider area.

The '''Harvester's Scythe''' is a [[Ror:Harvester's Scythe|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.  

When landing a critical strike, the holder heals a flat 8 ''(+4 per stack)'' health, multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the attack.  

Additionally, the first Scythe a player obtains grants +5% [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] chance. Stacking more Scythes will ''not'' increase critical strike chance further. 

== Notes ==
* The visuals for healing are always rounded up, but this does not reflect the actual healing gained.
* With no other sources of critical strike chance, the Scythe provides an average of 0.48 healing per hit. With a single {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, this is increased to 1.28 healing per hit.
**This is on average better than the {{ItemLink|itemName=Leeching Seed}}, although inconsistent. Gaining more critical strike chance makes the Scythe's healing more reliable and effective than the Leeching Seed.

== Tips ==
*Any way to guarantee critical strikes makes this item considerably stronger, even at low stacks. {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} can land guaranteed critical strikes with their {{SkillLink|skillName=Backstab}} and Weak Point mechanics, respectively, and any [[Survivors|Survivor]] can get guaranteed critical chance for a short period with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Ocular HUD}}.
*When not playing as the above Survivors and without the Ocular HUD, it might be worth avoiding the {{ItemLink|itemName=Lost Seer's Lenses}} if relying on the Harvester's Scythe for healing, as losing all {{ItemLink|itemName=Lens-Maker's Glasses}} dramatically lowers this item's effectiveness.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Interactables#Drones|drone]] that supports the player by healing their [[Survivors|Survivor]] and other allies. Once purchased, the Healing Drone flies close by and follows them. It is possible to bind more than one Healing Drone to the Survivor. After finishing the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], the Healing Drone travels to the next [[Environments|Environment]] along with the rest of the party.

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Heal ===
The Healing Drone heals a single nearby ally for either 5 seconds or until they reach full health, whichever comes first. This ally could be the player, a minion, or another drone.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===
# '''Stay close to owner''': the Healing Drone must be at least 35m away from its owner and the owner must be alive. This behavior is active for 2 seconds.
# '''Use primary on owner''': the Healing Drone must be within 15m from its owner, who must have less than 95% health. The Healing Drone will strafe the owner during this behavior.
# '''Go to owner off nodegraph''': the Healing Drone must be at least 10m away from its owner, have line of sight, and the owner must have less than 75% health. This is a precursor to healing the owner, so 75% health for the owner is the trigger point when they become more attentive.
# '''Go to owner''': similar to the previous behavior, but the Healing Drone has no line of sight to the owner and will therefore use the nodegraph for pathing.
# '''Use primary on closest ally''': the Healing Drone must be within 15m from its target, who must have less than 95% health. This behavior is active for 5 seconds, during which the Healing Drone will strafe its target. Due to how much the Healing Drone prioritises staying close to its owner, it will only heal another ally if the owner is already within 35m and above 95% health.
# '''Go to closest ally off nodegraph''': the Healing Drone must be within 10-60m from its target, have line of sight, and the target must have less than 99% health.
# '''Go to closest ally''': the Healing Drone must be within 20-60m from its target, and the target must have less than 99% health.
# '''Strafe the owner idly''': the Healing Drone must be within 20m from its owner. Due to the conditions for following/healing an ally, if the owner is dead, it is very likely the Healing Drone will find no suitable behavior and will revert back to its [[Enemy AI#Wander|Wander]]/[[Enemy AI#Look Busy|Look Busy]] state. Therefore, an injured ally will need to get the Drone's attention by getting within 60m from it. The Healing Drone will then heal/follow this ally until they are fully healed, killed, or stray too far away, at which point it will lose its attention again.

== Trivia ==
* Before [[PC Patch v1.2.2.0]], players with {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}} could be killed by their own Healing Drones if it got converted by a {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}}, with the death screen stating "Killed By: Healing Drone".
* If the player has damaged [[Health#Shield|shields]] and {{ItemLink|itemName=Aegis}}, the Healing Drone will not stop healing for 5 seconds or until the shields have recharged. This means the healing can contribute towards the [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] if the player's Health stat is full.

      <text bytes="16099" sha1="6vsjkz2hsvakdb4x2pz5xul5un9f1v2" xml:space="preserve">'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an attribute present on all [[Survivors]] and [[monsters]] in Risk of Rain 2. Taking [[damage]] reduces the player or monster's health. When a character's health reaches 0 or less, they die, granting [[Gold]] and [[Level|experience points]] to the killer (if the character was a monster) in addition to activating any on-kill effects. Any killed Survivors are revived upon entering a new [[Environments|level]]. If all Survivors in the current run are dead, the run ends, and a statistics screen appears. {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} and {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}} causes the holder to return to life upon death, restoring them to full health and making them {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Immune|altText=invulnerable}} for 3 seconds.

Various effects are calculated as a proportion of the character's max health or max health and shields, which will be referred to as ''maxHP'' and ''fullCombinedHealth'' for the remainder of the article.

Keep in mind that all the stat values below are internally stored are floats, but are rounded up to the nearest integer when displayed on the screen. For example, {{SkillLink|Auto-Nailgun}} with 1 stack of {{ItemLink|Leeching Seed}} actually heals for 0.6 health, but displays 1 and the rapid fire rate may create the illusion it heals for more.

== Health==
The base health value is calculated from the following contributions:
#&lt;math&gt;baseHealth + levelHealth \times levelsMinusOne&lt;/math&gt;
#+''prayerBeadsHealthBonus'' if the character has converted any {{ItemLink|Prayer Beads}} stacks to bonuses.
#+''infusionBonus'' if the character holds at least one stack of {{ItemLink|Infusion}}.
# +25 per stack of {{ItemLink|Bison Steak}}.
#+40 per stack of {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}.

A modifier with a starting value of 1.0 is then built by considering the following:
#[[BoostHp]] gives +0.1 per stack.
#{{ItemLink|Pearl}} and {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}, each giving +0.1 per stack.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} gives +0.07.
#The {{StatusEffectLink|Voidtouched}} affix gives +0.5.
# {{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} gives +1 per stack.

The final health value is then computed by multiplying the following:
#''base health value''
#''modifier''
#&lt;math&gt;1 / (1 + cutHpStacks)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the item given to all monsters while the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, effectively halving their health.
# 10, if the character is an {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|Umbra}}. 
#*The accumulated value so far will be referred to as ''beforePerfectedMaxHP''.
#If the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Perfected}} affix, the health is set 1.
#*The accumulated value so far will be referred to as ''beforeOverloadingMaxHP''. If the condition has not been satisfied, we simply have ''beforeOverloadingMaxHP = beforePerfectedMaxHP''.
#If the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Overloading}} affix, the health is halved. Holding both the Perfected and Overloading affixes effectively sets the health to 0.5.
#*The accumulated value so far will be referred to as ''tempMaxHP''. If the condition has not been satisfied, we simply have ''tempMaxHP = beforeOverloadingMaxHP''.
#1.5 if the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Tonic Buff}} active.
#The accumulated health at this point is cached for {{SurvivorLink|False Son|False Son's}} Growth calculations.
#&lt;math&gt;0.4 \times itemStacks \times buffStacks&lt;/math&gt; if the character has {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}} with the {{StatusEffectLink|Boost All Stats}} buff.
#&lt;math&gt;1 / cursePenalty&lt;/math&gt;

When the character's stats are recalculated, the old max health is stored and checked against the new max health. If the new max health is higher, the character is healed for the missing amount. Keep in mind that [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 5]] halves this effect, which is most noticeable with the {{StatusEffectLink|Overloading}} and {{StatusEffectLink|Perfected}} affixes in combination with {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}.

==Shield==
'''Shields''' work similarly to health, and appear as a blue (magenta if holding {{ItemLink|Plasma Shrimp}}) segment in the player's health bar. As characters suffer from damage, shields are emptied before health. Lost shields replenish over 2 seconds after the player takes no damage for 7 seconds. As a result, players must avoid damage for 9 consecutive seconds to fully regenerate their shields. Shield regeneration is separate from healing, so any modifiers to healing or effects that activate from healing will ''not'' apply to regenerating shields.

{{Color|note|Note:}} Gaining shields will ''not'' increase healing that restores a percentage of ''maxHP''. Therefore, these items' healing is ''not'' affected by any shields the player has: {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}, {{ItemLink|Medkit}}, {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}, {{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}}, {{ItemLink|Interstellar Desk Plant}}, {{ItemLink|Foreign Fruit}}, {{ItemLink|Gnarled Woodsprite}} (both the passive and active component), {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}, and{{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}. 

Shields will also not affect the damage from the {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}, the amount of health converted to additional shield by {{ItemLink|Silence Between Two Strikes}}, or the amount of fall damage taken, as all of these also depend on ''maxHP''.

However, ''fullCombinedHealth'' is treated as health for the purposes of {{ItemLink|Crowbar}}, {{ItemLink|Old Guillotine}}, {{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit}}, {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}, {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}}, {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}}, {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}, {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, [[barrier]] gain and limit from all sources ({{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}}, {{ItemLink|Aegis}}, and {{SkillLink|Scrap Barrier|Loader|Loader's Scrap Barrier}}), {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX's}} skills, [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]], and the damage from the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}.

Shield is indirectly influenced by {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}, {{ItemLink|Pearl}}, and {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}} since these effects depend on ''fullCombinedHealth''.

The {{ItemLink|Personal Shield Generator}} is a unique case, as it grants shields based on the user's actual maximum health, ignoring {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}. This means the Personal Shield Generator does ''not'' '''benefit''' from the health bonus Transcendence applies to health-providing items; however, ''neither'' does it '''suffer''' from Transcendence's health reduction. The Personal Shield Generator still benefits from the increased maximum health of {{ItemLink|Infusion}} normally. 

The shield value is computed by adding the following contributions: 
#&lt;math&gt;0.08 \times shieldGeneratorStacks \times tempMaxHP&lt;/math&gt;
#1 if {{StatusEffectLink|Full Shield}} is active ({{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}} during its special attack).
# 0.1 for each stack of {{ItemLink|Plasma Shrimp}}.
#&lt;math&gt;beforePerfectedMaxHP \times  (1.5 + (transcendenceStacks - 1) \times 0.25)&lt;/math&gt; if the character holds {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} or has the {{StatusEffectLink|Perfected}} affix. Note that effectively 1 stack of Transcendence gives a scaling factor of 1.5, while the Perfected affix only 1.25.
#&lt;math&gt;0.5 \times beforeOverloadingMaxHP&lt;/math&gt; if the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Overloading}} affix.

This value is then multiplied by the following factors: 
#1.5 if the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Tonic Buff}} active.
#&lt;math&gt;0.4 \times itemStacks \times buffStacks&lt;/math&gt; if the character has {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}} with the {{StatusEffectLink|Boost All Stats}} buff.
#&lt;math&gt;1 / cursePenalty&lt;/math&gt;

==Barrier==
[[File:Barrier.png|thumb|256px|Applied temporary barrier.]]
'''Barrier''' is displayed as a yellow, semi-transparent overlay over the health gauge. The maximum amount of barrier a character can have is equal to ''fullCombinedHealth'', and it depletes rapidly at a rate of &lt;math&gt;maxBarrier / 30&lt;/math&gt; per second. In the absence of any shields, this is effectively 3.33% of the character's maximum health per second. When taking damage, the barrier is depleted before shields.

Barrier can be used to circumvent the negative effect of {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, as it can double the player's halved max health temporarily.

==Curse ==
[[File:CurseHealthIndicator.png|thumb|256px|Curse reduction indicator.]]
'''Curse''' is an internal attribute that lowers maximum health. Curse prevents the player's health from healing back to full and is capable of disabling [[Damage|One-Shot Protection]] (OSP) if Curse is equal to or greater than 10% of maximum health. The portion of health removed by Curse appears as a hollow, partially shattered segment of the player's health bar.

The curse modifier reduces the health and shield stats by dividing them, effectively having a hyperbolic effect. The modifier starts with a base value of 1.0 and the following contributions modify it accordingly:
#&lt;math&gt;\times 2^{stacks}&lt;/math&gt; for any {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} stacks.
#&lt;math&gt;\times 10&lt;/math&gt; if the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} is active.
#&lt;math&gt;+0.01 \times stacks&lt;/math&gt; for any {{StatusEffectLink|Permanent Curse}} buff stacks.
#&lt;math&gt;+0.1 \times stacks&lt;/math&gt; for any {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction}} stacks while {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} is not active.
#&lt;math&gt;+0.1 \times stacks&lt;/math&gt; for any {{StatusEffectLink|Soul Cost}} stacks. The [[Shrine of Shaping]] always grants 3 so this value is effectively fixe

== Health Regeneration ==
All [[Survivors]] and some [[monsters]] regenerate health passively.

The regen stat relies on a regen factor for its calculation, &lt;math&gt;regenFactor = 1 + 0.2 \times levelsMinusOne&lt;/math&gt;. A temporary value is then build up by summing the following contributions: 
#&lt;math&gt;baseRegen + levelRegen \times levelsMinusOne + prayerBeadsRegenBonus&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;1.6 \times stacks \times regenFactor&lt;/math&gt; for {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}.
#&lt;math&gt;3 \times stacks \times regenFactor&lt;/math&gt; for {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}} if the character is out of danger (not taking damage for 7 seconds).
#&lt;math&gt;0.1 \times stacks \times regenFactor&lt;/math&gt; for {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}.
# 0.07 for {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}}.

The regen stat is then calculated with: 
#&lt;math&gt;temporaryValue \times difficultyModifier&lt;/math&gt;, which is the [[Difficulty#Initial Difficulty|difficulty]] regeneration modifier (Drizzle=1.5, Rainstorm=1, Monsoon=0.6).
#If the character is afflicted by {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire}} or {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}}, set the previous value to 0. This means that the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}} who has negative regeneration will not lose any health while on fire, assuming she can mitigate the burn damage.
#If Acrid's {{StatusEffectLink|CrocoRegen}} buff is active, add &lt;math&gt;0.1 * tempMaxHP&lt;/math&gt; to the previous value. This means {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} is unique in that he can still have some regeneration while on fire.
#If the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Perfected}} affix, set the previous value to &lt;math&gt;max(0, previousValue)&lt;/math&gt;. This means the Heretic will not lose any health.
#If the charater has any [[HealthDecay]] stacks, adjust the previous value according to &lt;math&gt;min(0, previousValue) - tempMaxHP / cursePenalty \times stacks&lt;/math&gt;.
#If the character is {{SurvivorLink|False Son}}, add 2.5 for each secondary skill charge spent.
#If the character has the {{StatusEffectLink|Tonic Buff}} active, multiply the previous value by 4.
#If the character has {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}} and any {{StatusEffectLink|Boost All Stats}} buffs, multiply the previous value by &lt;math&gt;0.07 \times itemStacks \times buffStacks&lt;/math&gt;.
#If Tonic Buff is not active and the character has any {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction|Tonic Afflictions}}, multiply it by &lt;math&gt;0.95^{stacks}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Healing==
The healing procedure is triggered every frame for &lt;math&gt;regen / 60&lt;/math&gt; amount, or whenever the character receives any healing, be it from proc effects such as {{ItemLink|Leeching Seed}}, active items such as {{ItemLink|Foreign Fruit}}, or other sources such as {{EntityLink|Healing Drone|Healing Drones}}.

The procedure goes through the following steps:
#If the character is {{StatusEffectLink|HealingDisabled|poisoned}}, exit immediately.
#If the character has {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}, multiply the amount by &lt;math&gt;1 + stacks&lt;/math&gt;.
#If the character is a player and the difficulty is [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 5]] or higher, halve the amount.
#If the character has {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}, set the reserve to &lt;math&gt;min(reserve + (amount \times (1 + stacks)), maxHP)&lt;/math&gt; and exit immediately. The healing procedure will be called at the appropriate intervals to apply the healing from the reserve, which means that Rejuvenation Rack and the Eclipse 5 modifier double dip their effects for this item.
#If the character has {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} debuff, multiply the amount by 0.8.
#If {{SurvivorLink|Seeker}} has accumulated any {{StatusEffectLink|Sojourn Healing}} stacks (staying in Sojourn mode for extended periods of time), multiply the amount by &lt;math&gt;1 - 0.1 \times stacks&lt;/math&gt;.
#Increase the health by ''amount'' up to ''maxHealh''.
#If the character has {{ItemLink|Aegis}}, there is any leftover amount, and it is not passive regeneration, increase barrier by &lt;math&gt;remainingAmount \times 0.5 \times stacks&lt;/math&gt;.
#If the healing is not passive regeneration, modify the {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} healing pool to &lt;math&gt;min(pool + amount * stacks, fullCombinedHealth)&lt;/math&gt;.

It subtracts the character's regen by &lt;code&gt;maxHP / stacks&lt;/code&gt;. This means that for each instance of this item the character has, it survives so many seconds without healing.

It is used by entities with temporary lifespan, e.g., y seconds without healing.

== No turrets, he name of this item is only a plac ghosts, and &gt;https://discordapp.com/channels. If such entities have access to healing, they can survive for longer.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, a sphere of blue flames surrounds the holder for 12 seconds, continuously inflicting the invisible {{StatusEffectLink|Helfire|displayIcon=false}} debuff on everything within 15 meters (including the holder and their allies). Once a character leaves the fire or the Tincture's effect expires, the Helfire debuff persists for an additional 3 seconds. 

The Helfire debuff deals damage 5 times per second. Each tick deals 0.5% of the holder's max health to themself, 0.25% of their max health to other allies, and 24% of their max health to enemies. This means that the damage per second is 2.5%, 1.25%, and 120% of the holder's maximum health to themself, to allies, and to enemies, respectively.

The Helfire debuff is nonlethal to the holder, so it will never bring them below 1 HP. 
== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of dealing 5% of your maximum health to yourself and 2.5% to allies is technically correct, but does not account for how all friendly-fire damage (including self-inflicted damage) is halved.&lt;ref&gt;https://discord.com/channels/417739215355510784/559901542787055636/943662181763911711&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- don't need to reword 2nd person perspective here, "yourself" is fine --&gt;
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of 8m radius is incorrect, and the description does not specify the duration.
* Survivors with natural [[armor]] take less damage from Helfire Tincture.
* It's possible to gain permanent uptime of the flames by having a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} and at least 4 {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, though proper preparations must be taken to ensure the player can stay alive.
* Although the Helfire debuff is invisible, it still counts towards the {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}}.
** However, the {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank}} changes the Helfire debuff into {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}}, which will combine with other affected fire sources such as {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} provides increased burn damage to enemies and yourself making the choice risky but powerful. Despite the increased self damage, the burn  is never lethal. 
**Allies can still die from the burn caused by {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}}, so be wary when using this combo near drones or other players. 


== Item Effects ==
=== Beneficial ===
* {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} can block self-damage ticks.
* {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} reduces the damage taken while on fire, and because it ticks extremely fast for low amounts, it's easy to reduce burning damage taken to 1. 
** Combining Armor Plates with the {{ItemLink|Planula}} can result in a steady healing over time effect. This theoretical build is limited by Planula’s scarcity.
** Since the {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}} is a global damage increase, it will increase the damage done to burning enemies. However, its range is slightly smaller than the flames' area of effect (13m versus 15m), so the player will need to get slightly closer to enemies to reap the benefits.
** Focus Crystal will give a damage boost against allies including other players. 
* {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} will activate each tick of burning, firing 5 times per second and rapidly triggering on-hit effects.
** Pairing the Razorwire with on-hit healing from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Leeching Seed}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Harvester's Scythe}} gives the player automatic healing as long as enemies are within the Razorwire's range.
** An{{ItemLink|Aegis}} can add a considerable barrier with enough on-hit healing.
** Stacking Tougher Times will occasionally prevent the Razorwire from activating. It is important to find a balance between Tougher Times, Razorwire, and on-hit healing.
* {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}, {{ItemLink|Infusion}}, {{ItemLink|Bison Steak}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Pearl}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Irradiant Pearl}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Stone Flux Pauldron}} increase the damage dealt by the flames while simultaneously increasing survivability.
** Having more max health increases the damage dealt, but likewise increases the damage taken, so more Repulsion Armor Plates are necessary. Taking 1 Repulsion Armor Plate per 1000 max health reduces each self-damage tick to 1.
* {{ItemLink|Mired Urn}} helps the player automatically heal when close to enemies, and inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} to slow them down and keep them in the burning area. It also pairs well with Focus Crystal by draining even more health.
* Having two {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus|altText=Bustling Fungi}} allows the player to stand still and recover HP at a higher rate than the Tincture burns them. 
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Weeping Fungus}} can accomplish the same thing but allows the player to continue moving.
* All of the healing strategies above are greatly enhanced by the {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}.
** The {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom|altText=Corpsebloom's}} recovery ceiling is lower than the self-injury inflicted by the Tincture and still affords the bonus healing that Rejuvenation Rack does. However, the Corpsebloom prevents the player from healing excessively, making Aegis practically useless and damage from enemies difficult to recover from.
* {{ItemLink|Voidsent Flame}} will trigger on the player if the burn ticks while at full health. However, these explosions do ''not'' deal self-damage, resulting in a huge damage boost with no downside as long as they can stay at full health.  {{ItemLink|Aegis}} is the best way to accomplish this.
** While shields do make it more difficult to use this strategy, as long as the combined value of the player's health, shields, and barrier is greater than their combined maximum health and shields, Voidsent Flame will still trigger.
* {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} will make all burn damage negligible, as the player's max health becomes 1.
** The same effect happens upon killing a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}} [[Monsters#Perfected|Elite]] while holding the {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}.
*** A lesser effect happens when the player gains the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} buff by killing an [[Monsters#Overloading|Overloading Elite]] while holding the Wake of Vultures, where half of their max health becomes shields. This means that, for the duration of the Overloading buff, all damage taken from and dealt by the Tincture is halved.

=== Detrimental or useless ===
* {{ItemLink|Medkit}} is near-useless because of how rapidly the burn damage ticks, constantly resetting the 2 seconds necessary to recover. The only way to make use of a Medkit is to proc Tougher Times many times in a row.
* The barrier from {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}} is consumed almost instantly, and—in the late-game—the stack requirement becomes too high to be sustainable.
* {{ItemLink|Personal Shield Generator}} and all shield effects ''do not'' increase the damage dealt, and shields require 7 seconds without taking damage to replenish.
* {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}} will never activate because the player is constantly taking damage.
* {{ItemLink|Rose Buckler}} can reduce incoming burn damage, but the effect is considerably smaller than a single Repulsion Armor Plate. The armor granted is still useful for approaching enemies.
* {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} should be avoided as the damage from this item is based on max health, not base damage. Halving your health will halve the damage that the Helfire Tincture deals.
* The {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank}} will multiply the damage on enemies and allies. Without plenty of healing, even one stack can make the self-burn damage get out of hand by dealing 10% of the user's maximum health per second as self damage.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the five new environments added to the game with the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'', located on [[Petrichor V]], and is found in the fifth set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

It has two notable surfaces that have an effect when an entity is standing on them:
#Lava: the character takes 10% of their max health as damage every 0.2 seconds. Some monsters are [[:Category:ImmuneToLava Characters|immune]] to this.
#Tunnel: the character receives a speed boost; 4 for the normal tunnel surface and 5 for the sections that glow in blue.

==Trivia==
*The {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}} and {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}} are twice as likely to be chosen as the [[Teleporter Boss]] than the other bosses.
**A consequence of this is that [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Horde of Many]] is also more likely to occur.
**Reaching Helminth Hatchery before [[Environments#Looping|looping]] when at least 60 minutes have passed, the [[Directors#The Scene Director|Scene Director]] will have sufficient credits to spawn an Overloading Worm if it is the first spawn card it selects. This has a 23.33% chance of happening. This is approximately twice as likely as the same thing happening on {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} because of the worm's higher spawning chance.
*Unlike its counterpart environment for stage 5, {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}, {{PAGENAME}} spawns white multishops instead of green. If [[Survivors of the Void]] is enabled, green multishops can spawn along with white ones. This inconsistency is likely an oversight for the interactable pool.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixWhite}} [[Monsters#Glacial|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Glacial Elite, but this chance is affected by {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with Her Biting Embrace gains the power of a Glacial Elite; their attacks all{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80|altText=greatly slow}} enemies hit. The duration of the slowing is affected by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]], with a base time of 1.5 seconds. Additionally, when the equipped player dies, they will explode for 150% damage and freeze enemies caught in the blast, with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.75. Enemies frozen this way can be executed as though they were frozen by {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}. However, without items that grant extra lives, such as {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}}, this is not very useful.

Although Her Biting Embrace is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} can make somewhat better use of this equipment than other [[Survivors]], since his turrets will become Glacial and explode on death as well. However, since the only other benefit is the slowing effect, it still may not be worthwhile for him.
**Additionally, Engineer's {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret|survivorName=Engineer|altText=TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} already {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50|altText=slow}} enemies without the need for this equipment. These slowing effects do stack, however.
* The slowing debuff is stacked separately from the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow60|altText=slowness}} inflicted by the {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}}, so combining these items will halt most enemies in their tracks.
** They also both count towards {{ItemLink|Death Mark}} separately, making it easier to get bonus damage.
**Combine these effects with {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX|altText=REX's}} innate {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Weak}} debuff to bring enemies to an effective standstill.

'''Kur-skan, the Heretic''' is a secret playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The Heretic ''cannot'' be selected from the character selection screen at the start of a run. Instead, she must be transformed into by holding all 4 Heresy items at once.

The items in the set, and their respective skills, are:
* {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}} - Hungering Gaze
* {{ItemLink|Hooks of Heresy}} - Slicing Maelstrom
* {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} - Shadowfade
* {{ItemLink|Essence of Heresy}} - Ruin

Along with these skills, the Heretic has extremely high base health, can triple jump, moves slightly faster than any other Survivor, and has a considerably higher base damage stat. However, she has ''negative'' health regeneration, causing her to lose health over time instead of recovering it, which scales positively with higher difficulties.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

The Heretic uses the exact same copy of behaviors as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando|altUrl=Commando#Behaviors}}. Because of this the Heretic will never be able to use {{SkillLink|skillName=Slicing Maelstrom}} and will use {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}} in the same Commando uses his utility rolls without taking into consideration if healing is urgent or necessary.

== Tips ==
* Well-timed usage of {{Color|heresy|Shadowfade}} is key to surviving as the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}}. It provides healing to offset her negative regeneration, and invulnerability to ensure she doesn't lose more HP than she already does naturally.
** Stacking {{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}} increases the duration of invulnerability and total HP recovered.
* The {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} negative health regeneration is ''amplified'' by the  {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}. Without other items to offset the higher HP degeneration, this can swiftly lead to her death.
** Despite the {{itemLink|Irradiant Pearl|altText=Irradiant Pearl's}} description claiming that it increases base regeneration, it does not actually amplify the {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} negative regeneration. Instead, it grants her a flat 0.1 (+ 0.02 per level) HP/s per stack.
** Additionally, the {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} negative regeneration will be reduced or amplified depending on the difficulty, with {{EntityLink|Monsoon|altUrl=Difficulty#Monsoon}} reducing the health degenerated per tick and {{EntityLink|Drizzle|altUrl=Difficulty#Drizzle}} amplifying the health degeneration.

* Obtaining at least two {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug|altText=Cautious Slugs}} will offset the negative health regeneration, and obtaining a third will allow the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}} to heal normally again. This is only the case after avoiding damage for a sufficient period, which is easier with Shadowfade.
* The same effect can also be achieved with multiple stacks of {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}}, as {{Color|heresy|Heretic|}} is a naturally mobile class. Make sure you have multiple, however, in order to properly counteract the negative healing.

* Equipping a {{ItemLink|Gnarled Woodsprite}} at level 6 and above will offset the negative regeneration, with even more extra healing the higher level the player is.
* Obtaining {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} will completely remove the {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} negative regeneration, at the cost of turning all her health into shields. 
** This is also the case when equipping the {{ItemLink|Shared Design}}, although this is much more rare.

* The {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} negative regeneration reduces her health directly and is not considered taking damage. As such, it cannot be reduced by [[armor]] or the {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}, and does not activate {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} or {{ItemLink|Planula}}.
** However, this also means that it does not inhibit [[Health#Shield|shield]] buildup.
** If health is reduced to less than 25% via health degeneration, it will not trigger the effects of either {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}.
** The player should be mindful if they can consistently maintain high levels or [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] with {{ItemLink|itemName=Topaz Brooch}}, as it will be harder to notice if the health is dangerously low. The portion of the barrier that overlaps with the health bar behind it will have a darker shade.
** If the player's health reaches zero, they will die regardless of how much shield or barrier they have left.
* Since the {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} triple jumps are considered base jumps, each one is affected by {{ItemLink|Wax Quail}}, allowing for significant vertical and horizontal movement.

* Activating a [[Shrine of Order]] or [[Cleansing Pool]] can remove Heresy items. When this happens, the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}} loses the skills corresponding to the missing Heresy items, and they are replaced with the non-functional {{Color|heresy|Nevermore}} skill. If unlucky with a Shrine of Order, the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}} may lose ''all'' skills and become unable to directly attack.
**Notably, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shuriken}} will still activate when using the {{Color|heresy|Nevermore}} in {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} primary skill slot (when the {{ItemLink|itemName=Visions of Heresy}} are lost). 

* Selecting {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} at the start of the game and transforming him into the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}} will allow her to use {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}} to destroy projectiles, as the Microbots are not lost when Captain transforms.
** Keep in mind that after Captain has become the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}}, any newly repaired drones or turrets will ''not'' be given Microbots, as that is a result of Captain's passive skill and not the item itself.

* If the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} is enabled or the player has any {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, it is highly advised they do ''not'' become the {{Color|heresy|Heretic}}. Her health degeneration is a flat amount, rather than a percentage of her health, unlike the healing from {{Color|heresy|Shadowfade}}. As a result, lowering her maximum health too much makes her unable to outpace her degeneration with {{Color|heresy|Shadowfade}}.

* Due to the {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} negative regeneration, she is especially vulnerable to fall damage. If the player fails to jump or use {{Color|heresy|Shadowfade}} before hitting the ground from a long fall, her HP will become 1 and she will die instantly.
**Keep in mind that {{Color|heresy|Shadowfade}} only removes {{Color|heresy|Heretic's}} hitbox and does not prevent direct damage. For example, if the player neglects to use {{Color|heresy|Shadowfade}} during a long fall, {{Color|heresy|Heretic}} will still receive potentially lethal fall damage.

==Trivia ==
*The Heretic has the highest base health and base damage of any Survivor, at 440 and 18 respectively. She also has a base speed of 8m/s, which is 1m/s faster than all other Survivors.
*The {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} has several unique interactions during his fight:
**At the beginning of the 4th phase while absorbing items, he will ''not'' take the Heresy items and the Heretic will not revert to the previous Survivor.
**He has unique dialogue when the Heretic has the {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}: "THE HERETIC… THE GUARDIAN… HOW? WHO PULLS YOUR STRINGS, VERMIN?"
**Upon killing the Heretic, he will say either "Die again, Heretic," or "Return to pieces, Heretic," referring to how she was eviscerated and how her eyes ({{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}), arms ({{ItemLink|Hooks of Heresy}}), legs ({{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}), and heart ({{ItemLink|Essence of Heresy}}) were each scattered across "the farthest depths of the Moon."
* The Heretic's {{SkillLink|Nevermore}} skill is a reference to the poem [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven The Raven] by Edgar Allan Poe.
*The ending phrases for the Heretic seem to be referencing the fact that she is actually two distinct beings: Kur-skan the Heretic, and the player's previous Survivor that is currently inhabiting her body.
*The Heretic seems to be a deformed {{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture}}.
*Completing an {{EntityLink|entityName=Eclipse}} run as the Heretic will unlock the next Eclipse level for the originally picked Survivor.
**However, completing a Monsoon run as the Heretic will ''not'' unlock the mastery skin for the original Survivor.
*Heretic is one of three survivors with multiple sets of pronouns, using she/they, the others being {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} and {{SurvivorLink|REX}}.
** She/her as just the Heretic, and They/them due to the playable Heretic being a combination of the Heretic and the survivor transformed with her.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a ground-based [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2 that looks and serves as a mortar.

The challenge [[The Demons And The Crabs]] requires the player to chase 20 Hermit Crabs off the edge of the map.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}
Unlike other monsters, the Hermit Crab will not spawn ''at all'' if the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} is enabled.

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
Hermit Crabs initially spawn a distance away from the player(s), so that they are not easily taken care of when spawned in.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Hermit Crab's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Bury + Mortar Volley ===
This skill has two modes depending on whether the Hermit Crab is on the move or burrowed. If it is not currently burrowed in the ground, it will burrow within 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]). While burrowed, it can fire a mortar. Then the mortar has a 3 second end lag period that is unaffected by attack speed followed by a 1 second end lag period that '''is''' affected by attack speed, after which it can be fired again. If the Hermit Crab moves while burrowed, it will unburrow over 1.3 seconds (scales with attack speed).

The mortar deals 400% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.5 in a radius of 7m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear]] falloff. The mortar's trajectory is adjusted so that it will land 4 seconds after being fired.

The skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds, which is only activated when the Hermit Crab first burrows in. However, the mortar '''can''' be fired while the skill is on cooldown. Therefore, the cooldown only prevents the Hermit Crab from burrowing twice in quick succession.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Unburrow and flee''': the Hermit Crab must be within 20m from its target. This behavior lasts for 3 seconds. If it is already unburrowed, it will simply run away. If it is burrowed, it will run away for &lt;math&gt;3 - unburrowTime&lt;/math&gt; seconds. It will also ignore the node graph, so it will flee directly away from the enemy. It is this behavior that causes Hermit Crabs to jump off from cliffs on {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}, as without ignoring the node graph they would not go off the stage.
# '''Use primary (mortar)''': the Hermit Crab must be within 20-120m from its target. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown, which means this will be the Crab's primary behavior while burrowed in and waiting for the mortar to come off cooldown. This behavior also does not require to have line of sight to the target, as the Hermit Crab always knows its target's position.
# '''Use primary (burrow)''': the Hermit Crab must be within 20-120m from its target and have line of sight. This ensure that sieging its enemy will be successful. However, it does not take into account obstacles for actually firing mortars from that spot, such as the ceiling in the cave on {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==

* Try to make a point of taking out Hermit Crabs whenever noticed, either directly or indicated by the mortar. A single one on its own is not particularly dangerous, but they can quickly become a problem if too many are left untouched.
* Due to the long delay between firing and landing as well as not predicting their shots, Hermit crabs will rarely if ever hit a target that is constantly moving. Take care not to back up into yourself if they are around however.

== Notes ==

* Oddly, Hermit Crabs are the only regular enemy in the game that cannot spawn in {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} or {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} that is not a {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} or {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemy, or a [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special boss.]] Strangely, they are able to spawn in the [[Simulacrum]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixEarth}} [[Monsters#Mending|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Mending Elite, but this chance is affected by {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with His Reassurance gains the power of a Mending Elite; they will heal all nearby allies over time, and spawn a {{MonsterLink|Healing Core}} on death.

Although His Reassurance is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}} do not affect its behavior.

== Notes ==

* Heals the nearest ally within 30m for 40% of the holder's [[Damage|base damage]] 4 times per second. This is unaffected by any damage boosting items, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}}.

== Tips ==
* Since this equipment only ever supports allies, it is considerably less useful in single-player runs. Non-player allies that can be healed are turrets, drones, the gummy clone from {{ItemLink|itemName=Goobo Jr.}}, {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}} ghosts, {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs}} from the {{ItemLink|Defense Nucleus}}, allied {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}, the {{MonsterLink|Solus Probe|Solus Probes}} from the {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}, {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards}} from the {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}, and all of the {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea|Newly Hatched Zoea's}} summons.
** Surprisingly, this equipment is not particularly helpful for {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}, since Mending Elites cannot heal each other. If Engineer and his turrets are all Mending, none of them will directly benefit each other.
* Due to {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} emphasis on having many drone allies nearby for defense, he can use this equipment well to make his supportive drone swarm even more survivable.
* Giving this equipment to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}} will give the player an ally that flies nearby and constantly heals them, along with any other drones that may be around, effectively turning the Equipment Drone into an even better {{EntityLink|Healing Drone}} or {{EntityLink|Emergency Drone}}.

'''His Spiteful Boon''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|AffixBead|Twisted}} [[Monsters#Twisted|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Twisted Elite, but this chance is affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with His Spiteful Boon gains the power of a Twisted Elite; tether to up to 5 allies within 35m and grant them 300 [[armor]]. When these allies have been hit 10 times, release a homing projectile that deals 100% base damage and inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}}.

Although His Spiteful Boon is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

==Tips== 
*Giving this to an [[Equipment Drone]] increases your and your allies' survivability.
**In the rare occurrence you encounter another Elite equipment, unless this new equipment provides a more important strategical benefit it is advised to avoid it because the Twisted Elite cannot tether itself to elite allies.
** Be mindful when you're playing as {{SurvivorLink|False Son}}, because when the Twisted ally is killed, it cleanses the {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} debuff from any monsters, which can interfere with {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}}.
***Similarly, acquiring a temporary Elite ally with the {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}} will have the same undesired effect when the ghost's health is depleted.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} can greatly benefit by this, as each individual turret that tethers to him grants 300 armor.
**This can be amplified even more with a third turret from {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}}.
*Playing with this equipment and the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} can be detrimental since if your tethered allies are hurt by your attacks, it will still charge the crystal. If the player is the trigger that causes the projectile to be released, it will be impossible to avoid since it spawns right next to them.

* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of {{color|d|175% damage per second}} is incorrect. The blade maelstrom can hit up to 5 times per second, dealing 175% damage per hit for 875% damage per second total.
* Charging up the projectile increases the initial launch velocity of the projectile, charging faster with increased attack speed. The projectile is automatically launched at full charge.
* Once thrown, the projectile rapidly decelerates and will usually come to a halt before it explodes on its timer.
* The projectile penetrates enemies and players but bounces off of terrain.
* The ending explosion has a radius of 14m and applies the {{StatusEffectLink|LunarySecondaryRoot}} debuff to enemies, rooting them.
}}
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Notes ==
* Since charging Slicing Maelstrom only increases the projectile's launch velocity, using it without charging at all is the most effective way to handle close-range targets.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} can benefit from this item, as it gives better crowd control options for him than {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Tazer|survivorName=Captain}} does and outscales Power Tazer in damage as well.
* Obtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the {{survivorLink|Heretic}}.
* Before [[PC Patch v1.2.3]] there was a bug that allowed {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} to reset the cooldown of Slicing Maelstrom by activating painting mode for {{SkillLink|Thermal Harpoons}} and closing it again, where all stacks of Slicing Maelstrom would be refreshed instantly. This effectively gave all stacks of Slicing Maelstrom no cooldowns, allowing Engineer to repeatedly use it extremely rapidly.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Hopoo Feather|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The item grants the player 1 ''(+1 per stack)'' additional jump.  

== Notes ==
* The additional jump is ''not'' affected by {{ItemLink|Wax Quail}}.
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}'s {{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret|Engineer|altText=TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} will not use Hopoo Feathers.

== Tips ==
* This item can benefit [[Survivors]] with low mobility, such as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} and {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}, enabling them to reach high places or dodge attacks that would otherwise be impossible.

*Players can use this item to cancel fall damage, by using the extra jump immediately before hitting the ground. This is especially relevant for Survivors who lack movement-related skills. This is not relevant for {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, who does not take fall damage at all.

* The "hopoo" in the name is a reference to the [https://twitter.com/the_hopoo?lang=en developer of the same name], as well as [http://hopoogames.com/ Hopoo Games]; the developers of both Risk of Rain games and [http://playdeadbolt.com/about.asp Deadbolt].

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

Upon killing an enemy, the holder gains 5 stacks of the {{StatusEffectLink|KillMoveSpeed}} buff (with a maximum of 5 stacks at a time). Each stack of this buff increases the holder's [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] by 25%, for a total increase of 125%. Each stack lasts only 0.2 seconds (''+0.1s per stack''), so all stacks are lost across 1 second (''+0.5s per stack'') if more enemies are not killed. 

== Notes ==
* When this effect triggers, a unique sound effect will play, and visual blur lines will appear over the character.

== Tips ==
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} will activate the Hunter's Harpoon. However, since the buff decays rapidly, the speed gained will be inconsistent without multiple stacks.

== Trivia ==
* The location "Keelhaul Key" in the logbook entry's shipping address is a reference to ''Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door,'' where in Chapter 5 of the game, the main location is called [https://www.mariowiki.com/Keelhaul_Key Keelhaul Key].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in ''Risk of Rain 2''.

With homing attacks, great mobility, and low health, the Huntress is a fragile but mobile character focused on evasion, which is especially important considering her low damage output. She is unlocked by default as an alternative to {{survivorLink|Commando}}.

* All arrows home in on a target, ignoring terrain and cover.
* Critical strikes are rolled immediately before firing projectiles. If the roll fails, 3 regular arrows are fired, and if it succeeds, 6 critically-damaging arrows are fired. This means that when Flurry successfully rolls a critical strike, it deals 4 times the normal damage instead of 2 times.
** While Flurry is initially weaker than Strafe, this interaction makes it stronger with high critical strike chance.
}}

* Can travel through terrain.
* The 10% damage boost is a multiplier; each bounce deals 1.1x as much damage as the previous one. 
** This allows {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} to activate {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}, {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, and {{ItemLink|Singularity Band}} on the last 2 hits.
* Laser Glaive deals a total of 2372% damage if it hits every bounce.

* Teleport a short distance only in the horizontal direction the player is facing.
** Unlike {{Color|huntress|Blink}}, the player cannot {{Color|huntress|Phase Blink}} upwards or downwards, only horizontally. 
* The distance traveled scales with movement speed.
* {{Color|huntress|Phase Blink}} resets vertical momentum.

* The targeted area has a radius of 7.5m, and it must be solid terrain.
** As a result, {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} can struggle to hit airborne enemies, since they cannot be directly targeted.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use special''': Huntress must be within 20m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 2 seconds.
# '''Use utility to flee''': Huntress must be within 6m from the target.
# '''Use secondary and strafe''': Huntress must be within 25m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it.
# '''Use utility to chase''': Huntress must be within 10-30m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': Huntress must be within 20m from the target. The primary will only be used if there is a locked on target.
# '''Use primary and chase''': no requirements. The primary will only be used if there is a locked on target.

== Tips ==
* The player can only sprint forward and forward/to the side, which might seem to limit the use of {{Color|huntress|Strafe}}, but they can still attack enemies behind them while sprinting away by quickly flicking the camera behind the player while using {{Color|huntress|Strafe}}.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Backup Magazine|altText=Backup Magazines}} are extremely useful for {{Color|huntress|Huntress}}, allowing her to use {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} multiple times back-to-back for crowd control.
* {{Color|huntress|Phase Blink}} travels in any horizontal direction with an exceptionally short cooldown, making it ideal for maintaining as much uptime on {{Color|huntress|Strafe}} as possible.
* {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}}, {{Color|huntress|Blink}}, {{Color|huntress|Phase Blink}}, and {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} can all be used to avoid fall damage, though {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} needs a target to be used. Be careful, as the player is vulnerable while hovering.
* {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} resets horizontal momentum, so use it first in jumping combos in order to {{Color|huntress|Blink}} to the desired location.
* The player can use {{Color|huntress|Blink}} or {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} during {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} in order to cancel the otherwise long startup animation for {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}}.
* Jumping during the animation of {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} will send the player higher.
* While {{Color|huntress|Flurry}} deals much more damage than {{Color|huntress|Strafe}} once the player increases their critical strike chance, it has a slower overall start-up time in early stages, which can hinder its effectiveness against groups of enemies. This can be further exacerbated if {{Color|huntress|Ballista}} is taken over {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}}.  
** Since each arrow from {{Color|huntress|Flurry}} can trigger items, stacking {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}} can increase its attack speed rapidly.
* Since {{Color|huntress|Strafe}}, {{Color|huntress|Flurry}}, and {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} can all be used while sprinting, {{Color|huntress|Huntress}} makes especially good use of the {{ItemLink|itemName=Rose Buckler}} and gets some much-needed survivability.
* For {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} vs {{Color|huntress|Ballista}} the choice is strongly in favour of the later; even if {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} is able to deal its full damage to a target, it is significantly less than {{Color|huntress|Ballista}} at 2090% vs 2700% and is done over a longer period of time and with a fairly poor [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2. Arrow rain ''is'' able to deal with crowds better and can potentially have more overall DPS if hitting multiple high hp enemies or simply large swarms, but this situation is too rare to be relied upon, especially as {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} already provides crowd control while {{Color|huntress|Huntress}} lacks any other strong single target options. It ''may'' be preferable for [[Simulacrum]] however due to its lack of early bosses and high enemy numbers.
** {{Color|huntress|Arrow Rain}} does at least synergise very well with items that work well with multiple hits and don't scale off of proc chance, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Plasma Shrimp}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shattering Justice}} or with items to group up a crowd into its effects like a {{ItemLink|itemName=Primordial Cube}}.

== Strafe vs. Flurry ==
* Strafe's [[Proc Coefficient#Proc Coefficient Effects|proc coefficient]] is 1.0, versus Flurry's 0.7 x 3 (or 0.7 x 6 with a critical strike). However, Strafe fires 2.6 times as fast as Flurry. This leaves us with an average of 2 procs per second for Strafe and 1.63 for Flurry without any items (1% critical chance). The table below shows both abilities' capability to proc items per second depending on crit chance.
**Aspects of many items are also affected by proc coefficient in addition to chance to trigger. Keep in mind that while the number of projectiles (and thus procs per second) increases with Flurry as it gains critical chance, the coefficient does not grow, which can be a limitation depending on the item. A few examples of these items are:
***{{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}: explosion range is also multiplied by proc coefficient. The 4m explosion is instead about 2.8m with a 0.7 proc coefficient.
***{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}: duration is multiplied by proc coefficient. Bleed normally lasts 3 seconds, but with a 0.7 proc coefficient it lasts 2.1 seconds instead. 
***{{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}: amount of healing gained per critical hit is normally 8 but with a 0.7 proc coefficient it becomes 5.6 instead.
**The amount of critical chance needed for Flurry to surpass Strafe in this stat is about 26% (2.04 vs 2).
***Keep in mind that regardless of the amount of procs per second, Strafe and Flurry's damage values do not change, meaning total damage items (like {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}} and {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}) deal less damage when triggered by flurry's hits individually (though they will trigger more often as critical chance is attained).

*The lock-on used by Huntress's {{Color|huntress|Strafe}}/{{Color|huntress|Flurry}} and {{Color|huntress|Laser Glaive}} abilities is slightly less sensitive than the one used by the {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}, and her main abilities can lock on to a different target than the capacitor on some occasions.
* Before the Anniversary Update, Huntress was unlocked by completing the [[Warrior]] achievement. {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} has taken her place as the reward for the achievement, and she is unlocked by default.
*Also before the Anniversary Update, Huntress's ending phrase was {{Color|#959494|"..and so she left, her soul still remaining on the planet."}}, reiterating her ending message from [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]].
*The scarf that Huntress wears in this game resembles the [[ror:Hermit's Scarf|Hermit's Scarf]] from the first game but colored red, which fittingly was unlocked by achieving 200% attack speed as Huntress.
*Despite the game's description, Huntress has the lowest damage output of the Survivors, with her only high damage output skill being on a 12 second cooldown. As such, she relies heavily on mobility to stay alive. In addition, she also has a very low proc rate, being only better than {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} in raw procs per second (things like{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}). She is still outmatched by other characters in total damage procs (such as [[Kjaro's Band|the]] [[Runald's Band|Bands]] or {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}).
*Huntress is most likely a bounty Hunter enlisted by {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} for the rescue mission.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} by landing a killing blow with every possible hit of a single {{SkillLink|Laser Glaive|Huntress}} (i.e. killing 7 enemies with one glaive, one per hit).

== Tips ==
* Stacking several {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} early in a run can one-shot enemies with each hit of the glaive.
* The {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} and {{ArtifactLink|Soul}} can make this challenge easier.
* This challenge may also be completed without items in the first stage by killing a group of seven {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisps}} that have each been hit with one {{SkillLink|Strafe|Huntress}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} by holding 12 {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} at once.

==Tips==
* An easy way to complete this challenge is to find a [[3D Printers|3D Printer]] that prints Crowbars and use it until 12 of them are obtained.
* This can also be achieved by using a [[Shrine of Order]], while holding a Crowbar. While this is a random chance, it can turn all held white items into Crowbars.
* This challenge is completely trivialized by the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} by starting and finishing either [[Rallypoint Delta]] or [[Scorched Acres]] without falling below 100% [[health]].

== Tips ==
* 100% health includes [[Health#Shield|shields]], but not [[Health#Barrier|barriers]]. As such, the {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}} and {{ItemLink|Aegis}} can help make the challenge easier.
** The Topaz Brooch pairs very well with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}}, giving the player barriers on demand when activated.

* Having a few {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} might be useful, as they could potentially save the player from stray projectiles. However, avoiding enemies altogether is generally better.

* This challenge can be completed at any point in a run, meaning that after a loop, past stage 3, this challenge is still available.

* Even with {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}, taking damage will fail the challenge.

* The max HP reduction from {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} or the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} does ''not'' count as losing health.

* Consider attempting this challenge in multiplayer. Huntress herself can focus much more on avoiding enemies while contributing with the occasional {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain|Huntress}}.

* With a {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}} and 2-3 {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, Huntress can indefinitely stay airborne and remain far away from any combat. 
** The same can be done with a {{ItemLink|itemName=Hardlight Afterburner}} when using {{SkillLink|skillName=Blink|survivorName=Huntress}}.
** Avoid flying too high or off to the sides of the map, as this will count as falling out of bounds and therefore make the player take fall damage from being respawned.
*Having the [[Artifacts|Artifact of Kin]] activated can allow for only the melee enemies from each stage to spawn, such as [[Bighorn Bison]] for [[Rallypoint Delta]] or [[Beetle]]s for [[Scorched Acres]], making the challenge significantly easier as long as the player can keep their distance and avoid fall damage. but it can also make the challenge nearly impossible if hitscan enemies, like [[Lesser Wisp]]s or [[Stone Golem]]s spawn instead.

* If the player is able to do this challenge on {{entityLink|Rallypoint Delta}} and has enough movement items or an [[Eccentric Vase]], they can make their way to the island outside of the stage where no enemies will spawn.

'''Ifrit's Distinction''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixRed}} [[Monsters#Blazing|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Blazing Elite, but this chance is affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with Ifrit's Distinction gains the power of a Blazing Elite; their attacks will {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=burn}} enemies for 50% [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] over time, and a trail of fire will follow them and hurt any enemy that makes contact with it. 

Although Ifrit's Distinction is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

== Tips ==
* Melee [[Survivors]] such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} and {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} make somewhat better use of Ifrit's Distinction, since they will generally be close enough to enemies to burn them with their fire trail. However, the large amount of extra burn damage will benefit all Survivors to some degree.
* Equipping Ifrit's Distinction on Acrid will allow them to {{SkillLink|Poison|Acrid|altText=poison}} and burn enemies simultaneously. This gives an easy way to Acrid to finish off enemies that have been poisoned, since poison can only bring them to 1 health but they will die from burning.
* Having the {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} makes this equipment drastically more powerful. Even a single stack will raise the total damage over time to a whopping 200% total damage, tripling the holder's overall damage output. Further Ignition Tank stacks will make the damage even more severe.
*Since Ifrit's Distinction guarantees the Burn debuff on hit, it can be contributed towards the activation of {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}}.

==Trivia==

* The name "Ifrit's Distinction" is a reference to a boss from the first ''Risk of Rain'', [[Ror:Ifrit|Ifrit]]. Known as the "Scion of the Infernal King," Ifrit was a large flaming beast that summoned pillars to trap players and attacked with fire.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

Any of the holder's attacks that would inflict {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|Ignite}} instead inflict {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}}. Stronger Burn deals 300% (''+300% per stack'') more damage over time than Ignite. 

== Notes ==
* Enemies inflicted with {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}} spark with reddish-white energy.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer}} can reap huge benefits from this item. Having just a single stack makes {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt|artificer}} and {{SkillLink|Flamethrower|artificer}} deal nearly twice as much total damage, with further stacks increasing their lethality even more.
* Although the {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture|Helfire Tincture's}} debuff is invisible, it is affected by the Ignition Tank. This is a double-edged sword, since it will deal immense damage but also hurt the user much more.
* Aside from skills, Ignite can be inflicted with {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}, the {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}}, {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture|Helfire Tincture}}, and the {{ItemLink|Molotov (6-Pack)}}.
** Becoming {{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed|Blazing}} due to {{ItemLink|Ifrit's Distinction}} or {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}} will cause all the player's skills to inflict Ignite as well, making the Ignition Tank dramatically increase almost all damage.
*Ignition tank does NOT work with {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} or {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, as they don't apply a debuff.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Black Imp|returning]] floating demon-like [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Imp}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 35% of the Imp's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Abyssal Slash ===
The Imp slashes twice in front, dealing 150% damage per hit and inflicting {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding}} for 5 ticks, with each dealing 20% damage. Each slash moves the Imp a bit forward. The attack lasts for 1.2 seconds in total, which scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second and each slash has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.4.

=== Utility: Abyssal Blink ===
The imp can "blink" (teleport) a short distance away. It looks ahead and finds the closest ground node point from that spot to teleport to. This means that if the Imp is currently in the air, it will teleport to the ground. If it is facing a cliff, where no node points exist, it may blink backwards. It is very likely the closest node point will not be where the Imp is facing or heading to and will therefore appear to teleport in a zig-zag pattern. 

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds. The Imp can store three charges of this skill.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary and chase off nodegraph''': the Imp must be within 9m from its target. The skill must be initially off cooldown for it to be selected, but it will remain active for 3 seconds, meaning the Imp will continue chasing for the duration and activate the skill whenever it comes off cooldown again.
# '''Blink (close)''': the Imp must be within 8-25m from its target. This behavior will remain active for 1 second and cannot be chosen twice in a row. It is mainly used to close in the distance.
# '''Strafe waiting for the primary''': the Imp must be within 10m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Imp must be within 10-20m from its target and have line of sight. If it is within 10-20m from its target, it will effectively alternate betwen blinking and after 1 second selecting this behavior, which then allows it to blink again (assuming it has any charges left). This can allow the player to tactically exhaust the Imp's utility charges before they attempt to take an accurate shot at it.
# '''Blink (far)''': the Imp must be at least 50m away from its target and have line of sight. This behavior cannot be chosen twice in a row.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. If the Imp is more than 50m away, it will effectively alternate between this and blinking to close the distance whenever the skill is off cooldown.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Imp Overlord|returning]] [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Imp}} monster family. Being a Boss, the Imp Overlord may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}
== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Void Spike ===
The Overlord swipes and throws 6 spikes at its target in a horizontal fan pattern. Each spike is thrown at 10° intervals with the initial one having a velocity of 120m/s and each subsequent one 10m/s less. Each spike deals 30% damage and inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding}} for 10 ticks. Spikes that don't strike a target stick in the ground where they fall exploding in a radius of 2m, last for 5 seconds, and deal the same amount of damage to players that touch them. The spikes both as projectiles and on the ground can be intercepted by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

There is technically a second attack involved here, which is an area-of-effect where the Overlord swipes his arm which deals 200% damage and has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. However, the player is extremely unlikely to be hit by it unless they are right in front of where he swipes.

The attack overall has an animation duration of 3 seconds which scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

The skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds, and the Imp Overlord can store up to 3 charges. Each spike has a proc coefficient of 0.8.
=== Secondary: Decimate ===
The Imp Overlord violently and repeatedly lashes out in front for 3 seconds, dealing an immense 5 x 200% damage to targets within a 12m radius with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|sweet spot]] falloff.

The skill has a cooldown of 1 second and a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 per hit.

=== Utility: Blink ===
The Imp Overlord periodically disappears, re-materializing in a different location up to 300m away after a few seconds. After disappearing for 1 second, a large red circle appears on the ground, as well as some floating particles, to telegraph where it will appear next. 2 seconds later the Overlord will reappear in this location and anyone who is within a 14m radius will receive 400% damage with linear falloff and a proc coefficient of 1.0. This attack has an end lag of 1.5 seconds.

The skill has a cooldown of 9 seconds. This attack is not to be confused with the Overlord's death animation, in which a portal emerges and the Overlord is unwillingly dragged back to its original dimension.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use secondary''': the Overlord must be within 15m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Use utility''': the Overlord must be at least 20m away from its target.
# '''Use primary''': the Overlord must be within 90m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Shatterspleen]]''

If the Imp Overlord is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Imp Overlord) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}}.

== Tips ==
* Given the Imp Overlord's high movement speed and ability to teleport, maintaining a safe distance can prove difficult. Even so, staying on the move is preferable to standing still; while the Overlord's Spike Volley can be a nuisance, the alternative - its melee attack - is much more dangerous.
* While kiting an Imp Overlord, it's best to avoid retracing one's steps too often. The area will eventually become littered with planted spikes and the likelihood of accidentally walking backwards into them increases the longer the battle goes on. To that end, items that enhance vertical mobility, such as {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather|altText=Hopoo Feathers}} or {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}, make dealing with Overlords' spikes considerably easier.
* While fighting an Imp Overlord with melee attacks can be perilous due to its Decimate attack, the player can attempt to hug the uppermost part of its body to avoid being hit by the ground slams.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Interactables#Drones|drone]] that can support the player by burning nearby enemies.

Once purchased, the Incinerator Drone flies close to enemies it sees and burns them. It is possible to bind more than one Incinerator Drone to the [[Survivors|Survivor]]. 

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Flamethrower ===
After a 0.6 second windup, the Incinerator Drone shoots a flamethrower that deals 666.66% damage per second for 3 seconds. The damage from this attack ticks 7 times per second with a proc coefficient of 1.0, and each hit has a 50% chance to {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire}} targets. This attack is similar to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Flamethrower|survivorName=Artificer}}, but it has shorter range (12m versus 21m) and longer cooldown (10 seconds versus 5 seconds). However, the cooldown starts instantly, unlike the Artificer's skill which starts after the skill has finished. This makes it an effective cooldown of 6.4 seconds. 

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Go to owner''': the Incinerator Drone must be at least 120m away from its owner, who must be alive. This behavior is active for 3 seconds, and at the end of which the Drone will refresh its enemy target.
# '''Use primary while strafing''': the Drone must be within 12m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 3 seconds,
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Drone must be within 40m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': the Drone must be within 40-100m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Strafe the owner idly''': the owner must be alive. This is effectively used when there are no enemies around.
# '''Go to owner when no enemies''': the owner must be alive. The Drone will refresh its enemy target at end of it.
# '''Use primary while chasing when the owner is dead''': no requirements.

== Notes ==
* Incinerator Drones tend to hang low near the ground during combat, so they may suffer tremendous damage from {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixRed}} [[Monsters#Blazing|Elite]] fire trails or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} [[Monsters#Malachite|Elite]] spike pits. At higher difficulties, it may not be worth purchasing Incinerator Drones due to how quickly they may be destroyed.
** However, the Incinerator Drone does deal very high damage, so it is worth having as long as the player is willing and able to babysit it.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Infusion|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When the holder kills an enemy, their maximum health increases by 1 ''(+1 per stack)'', up to a maximum of 100 ''(+100 per stack)'' bonus health.

== Notes ==
* {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Turrets}} spawned by an {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} will have the Infusions and their effects, but since they do not share kill counts with Engineer, they do not benefit from any bonus health until they make their own kills.
* If all Infusions are removed via a [[3D Printers|3D Printer]] or otherwise, the bonus health is lost.
** If any Infusions are regained, all bonus health is instantly restored, even if the bonus health is more than 100 per held Infusion.
* If the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} is active, an Infusion's health gain to kill ratio is changed from 1:1 to 1:10.
* This item does not count as a healing item, and thus does not invalidate the requirements for the [[Naturopath]] challenge.
* Destroying explosive pots on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]], Fusion Cells on [[Rallypoint Delta]], Alloy Vulture Nests on [[Siren's Call#Alloy Vulture Nests|Siren's Call]], flying rocks on [[Sky Meadow]], or birds on [[Distant Roost]] will give a charge of infusion.
* {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} will give a charge of Infusion for every time it triggers.
* Having any number of Infusions will make the health bar red, instead of the normally green color.
* It is possible for a single Infusion to give more than 100 health per stack if multiple enemies are killed at the same time and the kill count for the infusion is close to its cap. 
* The red particle effect that seeks out the player after having killed an enemy while having an Infusion is what gives the bonus health, and not the kill itself.

They are immovable, but can be interacted with. Most interactables can only be interacted with once per Environment visit, while others multiple or unlimited number of times.

Some interactables have an interaction cost attached to them that the player has to pay to activate them.  The various cost types are [[Gold]], [[Lunar Coins]],[[Health]], or certain [[Items|Items/Equipment]]. Upon activation each interactable has an effect, such as granting the player with loot or health, teleporting to the next Environment, or unlocking any secret areas and [[Survivors]].

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Interstellar Desk Plant|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

5 seconds after the holder kills an enemy, a small potted plant appears on the ground where that enemy died. After another 0.5 seconds, the plant creates a healing zone with a 10 meter radius (''+5m per stack'') that heals all allies within for 5% of their maximum health per 0.5 second, similarly to {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}. It takes 0.5 seconds for the healing radius to reach its maximum size.

Each plant lasts for 10 seconds before disappearing.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of the base healing radius being 5m is incorrect. It is actually 10m.

== Tips ==
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} pairs very well with this item, as it will spawn multiple plants on top of each other and create a powerful healing radius.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} can make some great use with this item, especially if running the ability{{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret|survivorName=Engineer}}. Since the turrets move with Engineer, the nearby enemies that they kill will activate this item, and the turrets can possibly walk into the healing area.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|yellow]] [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

It can only be obtained from a [[Cleansing Pool]] in exchange for a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]], and increases ''all'' the holder's stats by 10% (''+10% per stack'').

The Irradiant Pearl has a drop rate of 20%. Its common counterpart is the {{ItemLink|Pearl}}, which only increases the holder's health.

When combined with both the scarcity of Cleansing Pools and the general unlikelihood of players having mass amounts of lunar items to trade, the Irradiant Pearl becomes one of the rarest items, if not ''the'' rarest item, in the game. &lt;!-- Is it not just the rarest of them all? What item comes even close in normal play? --&gt;

== Notes ==
* The {{ItemLink|Recycler}} cannot be used to transform other boss items into an Irradiant Pearl, or vice versa.
* Irradiant Pearls cannot be obtained while the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is active. Cleansing Pools do not spawn, and neither the Pearl or the Irradiant Pearl can be selected from Yellow Command Essences.
* While Irradiant Pearls can be scrapped with a [[Scrapper]] for {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Yellow|altText=Yellow Item Scraps}} and are the same rarity as other boss items, Yellow Scrap cannot be used with the Cleansing Pool, and Irradiant Pearls will never be offered by an [[3D Printers#Overgrown 3D Printer|Overgrown 3D Printer]].
* Increasing maximum health or regeneration is not considered healing, so picking up an Irradiant Pearl does not fail the [[Naturopath]] challenge.
* The Irradiant Pearl only multiplies base [[armor]], meaning it provides a maximum benefit of 2 armor on [[Survivors]] like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, and gives no armor to Survivors without base armor.
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of adding 10% regeneration is incorrect; it actually increases regeneration by a flat 0.1 (+ 0.02 per level) HP/s per stack. This is ''effectively'' a 10% increase for most Survivors, except for {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Acrid}}, and the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}.

The '''Item Scrap, Green''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item has no passive effect. However, when using a [[3D Printers|3D Printer]] or [[Bazaar Between Time#Cauldrons|Cauldron]], the Scrap will be prioritized and consumed before any other item. This item is obtained from a [[Scrapper]].

== Notes ==
* Like all scrap, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Recycler}} cannot be used on this item.

* If the player uses a [[Shrine of Order]] while holding Scrap, it is possible for all their items of the same rarity as that Scrap to be transformed into Scrap.

As players run through [[Environments|stages]], they will collect [[Items]] from [[Chests]] and other sources. As their run continues deeper and deeper, they will eventually find copies of items they've previously encountered. Picking up additional copies of an item is called "stacking" the item, and the total number of items of the same item is often called "stacks" of that item.

All items in the game (with the exception of [[Items#Active Items|equipment]] and {{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty|altText=one special item}}) have amplified effects when stacking. The more stacks an item has, the more that effect is noticeable. For example, a single {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}} raises movement speed by 14%, which is good, but stacking 30 of them would result in a 420% increase, which is extremely good for both mobility and evasion.

Most items have one or two numerical variables that increase with stacking, but that variable is not always the same between items. For example, {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} and {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}} both have a chance to apply an effect that deal damage on a hit, but while stacking the former increases the damage of its effect, stacking the latter increases the chance of its effect occurring. The effect of stacking on each item is described in the item's page.

Note that for some items, the listed value in-game does ''not'' reflect the actual effect of the item. This is especially true for items that stack non-linearly, as explained below.

==Stacking types==
While many items stack in the way you would expect (having 3 items triples the effect, for example), many others do not. However, most items stack consistently in one of 3 ways, and scale in a similar manner to items of the same category. These categories are outlined below.

Note that a few items have several scaling statistics that use different scaling methods. The {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}}, for example, has both a linearly stacking (+1 charge per stack) and an exponentially stacking one (x0.85 equipment cooldown per stack).

===Linear Stacking===
Most items in the game stack linearly - meaning that for every added item, the bonus keeps increasing by the same base amount. For example, the {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}} increases attack speed by +15%. Having 2 of this item raises the bonus to +30%, and 10 of them to +150%.

The formula for an affected statistic is the linear function : &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1 + a \bullet x&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' is the effect of one item and ''x'' is the number of items.

===Hyperbolic Stacking===
[[File:Hyperbolic stacking graphic for tougher times.png|thumb|370x370px|Tougher times block rate per item]]
For many items using percentages (mostly for control items or items that reduce a statistic), using linear stacking would eventually lead to a 100% chance of triggering or 100% reduction. This would lead to wild imbalance from a design standpoint, such as becoming totally invulnerable or always stunning hit enemies. For this reason, these items use a different type of scaling called hyperbolic stacking.

The formula for an affected statistic is the reciprocal function : &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1 - 1 / (1 + a \bullet x)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' is the effect of one item and ''x'' is the number of items.

{{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} for example, uses ''a'' = 0.15 -- so with 10 Tougher Times, the block chance would be equal to &lt;math&gt;1 - 1 / (1 + 0.15 \bullet 10) = 1.5 / 2.5&lt;/math&gt;, or a 60% chance. Once 223,696,201 Tougher Times are stacked, the block chance becomes 100% due to the limitations of floating point numbers. Interestingly, using this equation when x is 1, you end up with a 13.04% block chance as opposed to a 15% block chance.

An intuitive way of visualizing hyperbolic stacking is through a lottery example. Imagine that there are green and red tickets in a box. Every time the chance is tested, one ticket is drawn at random. If it is green, the effect triggers, otherwise it does not. By default, the box has 100 red tickets and no green tickets. Every time an item is acquired, some green tickets are added to the box. One Tougher Times would add 15 in this case. The more green tickets are added, the more they are likely to be picked over red tickets. However, there is always a chance that a red ticket is picked instead, no matter how small. This means that, in short, the more of something you have, the less the base adding is until it is as close to 0 as possible.

=== Reciprocal Stacking ===
This is similar in nature to the hyperbolic stacking and in fact mathematically they belong in the same category. The conceptual difference is that the formula in this case is &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a / x&lt;/math&gt;. Because it does not calculate the complement of the reciprocal, the graph looks mirrored along the x-axis compared to the hyperbolic stacking, i.e., the effect is at its strongest with 1 stack and it decreases as more stacks are accumulated but it never reaches 0%.

Due to the fact that with two stacks the strength of the effect is halved, a lot of items' descriptions that use this stacking behavior incorrectly state that the effect is reduced by 50%. However, this is only true for going from 1 to 2 stacks, as at 3 stacks the effect is at 33.33% strength instead of the expected 25%.

If an item with this stacking behavior affects something unrelated to the item's effect, e.g., not its own cooldown duration, the formula may instead be &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a / (x + 1)&lt;/math&gt; just so even the first stack can have an effect.

===Exponential Stacking===
Some items in the game are very powerful because of their exponential stacking, meaning that their stacking effects compound each other. For instance, one stack of {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} doubles damage and halves health. Another stack will double the new damage and halve the new health, meaning that final damage would be quadrupled instead of tripled, and final health would be divided by 4 instead of 2.

The formula for an affected statistic is the exponential function : &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a^x&lt;/math&gt;, where ''a'' is the effect of one item and ''x'' is the number of items.

The power of exponential stacking is that unlike both other types of stacking, they do not suffer from diminishing returns since their effects are compounding. For example, going from 50 to 51 stacks of {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}} would raise the attack speed bonus from +750% to +765%, which is a negligible increase. Similarly, going from 50 to 51 {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} would increase block chance from 88.2% to 88.4%, which leads to an increase in expected survivability of about 1.7%. By contrast, going from 50 to 51 {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} would still double an already monstrously high damage and halve a ridiculously low health.

===Special Stacking===
The {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} uses its own special stacking formula close to hyperbolic stacking - the drop rate of an ammo box is equal to &lt;math&gt;1 - 1 / (1 + x)^{0.33}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''x'' is equal to the number of Bandoliers. While this looks like other hyperbolic stacking items, the nature of the 0.33 exponent means that the first couple Bandoliers will have a huge impact on drop chance, while the following ones will rise very slowly. More detailed information on the Bandolier's stacking can be found on its dedicated page.

==Stacking limits==

All items can be stacked infinitely (at least up to the signed 32-bit integer cap of 2,147,483,647), and their effects will also stack accordingly. However, some items have an effective limit after which further stacks have no effect.

Items with a chance to trigger that increases linearly will not gain any additional effects once the chance reaches 100%. For example, once 100% critical chance is reached through 10 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, picking up additional stacks of this item will not grant stronger critical hits (unless you're playing as Railgunner, whose passive will convert it to crit damage), or have any other effect. Note that for some items linked to the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] (on-hit items), the effective limit differs depending on the character.

{{ItemLink|Focused Convergence}} has a hardcoded cap of 3, after which neither of its effects increases.

{{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}} is limited to 255 equipment charges.

{{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} can only be stacked up to 127 copies, as the player will die upon collecting a 128th due to the limits of floating point numbers.

==Trivia==
* All items can be stacked to a maximum value of [[wikipedia:2,147,483,647|2,147,483,647]] - the 32 bit integer cap - before overflowing. Upon overflow, the item will reset back to 1, and act as if there is only 1 item in the player's inventory (a notable exception is the {{ItemLink|itemName=Personal Shield Generator}}, which has a visual bug upon overflow). Due to this, the hard cap for all items is 2,147,483,647, with no items having a hard coded cap before this value, other than the three items listed in the previous category above.
*Prior to the rework it received in the Anniversary update, the {{ItemLink|Rusted Key}} used a formula similar to the lottery tickets analogy for its item rarity chances by using (metaphorical) White, Green and Red tickets - which grow at different rates - to determine the rarity of the dropped item. The new version always has the same yields as a large chest and does not stack, but consumes 1 key when opened.

'''Items''' are special collectibles that spawn while playing the game.

Players can pick items up to gain a special effect based upon what type of item it is. Each item's icon also has a colored border to indicate its rarity:
&lt;div class="color-link"&gt; 
*'''{{Color|common|[[#Common|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Common}}) White]]}}''' (Common)
*'''{{Color|uncommon|[[#Uncommon|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Uncommon}}) Green]]}}''' (Uncommon)
*'''{{Color|legendary|[[#Legendary|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Legendary}}) Red]]}}''' (Legendary)
*'''{{Color|boss|[[#Boss|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Boss}}) Yellow]]}}''' (Boss / Planet)
*'''{{Color|lunar|[[#Lunar|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Lunar}}) Blue]]}}''' (Lunar Items)
*'''{{Color|void|[[#Void|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Void}}) Purple]]}}''' (Void)
*'''{{Color|equipment|[[#Equipment|({{#invoke:Items|TierCount|AllEquipment}}) Orange]]}}''' (Equipment)
&lt;/div&gt;
Some items and equipment need to be unlocked by completing a [[Challenges|Challenge]] to appear in game. If an item or equipment has a blacked out logbook entry, it needs to be picked up in a run before it becomes accessible to read.

There are currently {{#invoke:Items|ItemCount}} in the game. You can find a list of all these items below. However, this does not include the {{Color|untiered}} items, which are also covered below.

==Passive Items==
A '''passive''' item visually appears in the top bar in-game and provides a certain benefit to a player (or in some cases, a drawback), specific to that item, as long as it is in a player's inventory. If it is removed from their inventory (''e.g. by using a [[3D Printers|3D printer]]''), they no longer are affected by that item's effects.

There is no limit to how many different types of passive item, or how many of a passive item a player can hold at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Item Stacking#Trivia]]. Item count overflows at 2,147,483,647, which is highly unlikely to affect normal gameplay.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiples of a specific item ''stack'' the item's effects in a particular manner, instead of each affecting the player individually. ''See: [[Item Stacking]]''

===Common===
'''{{Color|common|Common}}''' items are generally the first items a player will obtain in game. They can be extremely powerful in large quantities, and thus should not be underestimated. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Common}} Common items.

{{#invoke:Items|Table|Common}}

===Uncommon===
'''{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}''' items, as the name suggests, are rarer and possibly more powerful. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Uncommon}} Uncommon Items.

{{#invoke:Items|Table|Uncommon}}

===Legendary===
'''{{Color|legendary|Legendary}}''' items are extra-rare in game, with approximately 1% chance to drop from a [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]], and about a 20% chance from a [[Chests|Large Chest]]. However, there are more efficient ways to obtain Legendary items. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Legendary}} Legendary Items.

{{#invoke:Items|Table|Legendary}}

===Boss===
'''{{Color|boss|Boss}}''' items (also known as ''planet items'' or ''field-found items'') are uncommon items that may drop as rewards for defeating [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Bosses]], each representing a signature attack or characteristic of the corresponding boss. These ''cannot'' be obtained from chests. Each boss item may only drop if its respective boss monster spawned as the Teleporter Boss (''e.g. Titanic Knurls may only drop if the Teleporter Boss was a Stone Titan''). There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Boss}} Boss items. 

*Every green item rewarded for completing the Teleporter event has an independent 15% chance to drop as that boss's Boss Item instead of a green item.
*Every item of yellow rarity is corrupted collectively by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Newly Hatched Zoea}}, not just items that drop from bosses

{{#invoke:Items|BossTable}}

===Lunar===
'''{{Color|lunar|Lunar}}''' items are a new tier of items introduced in Risk of Rain 2. They are characterized by their powerful abilities, at the cost of having considerable drawbacks. Chests and other common loot interactibles will ''not'' drop lunar items; the only ways to obtain them are from [[Lunar Pod]]s found rarely throughout environments or from the [[Bazaar Between Time]]. Both methods require spending [[Lunar Coins]], as opposed to [[gold]]. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Lunar}} lunar items. (''You can also bring them to the [[Cleansing Pool]] check the page for more information.)''

{{#invoke:Items|Table|Lunar}}

===Void===
'''{{Color|void|Void}}''' items are a new tier of items introduced in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion. They are unique in that, in addition to their normal effects, they will also {{Color|v|"corrupt"}} other items. When picking up a void item, all stacks of that item's "uncorrupted" counterpart(s) transform into an equal number of the void item (for instance, picking up a {{ItemLink|itemName=Needletick}} while holding 3 {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger|altText=Tri-Tip Daggers}} will result in 4 Needleticks and 0 Daggers). Additionally, while holding a given void item, picking up its counterpart will instantly corrupt that item as well (for instance, picking up a Tri-Tip Dagger while already holding a Needletick will instantly convert the Dagger into a Needletick). This makes it impossible for a void item to coexist with its uncorrupted counterpart in a single inventory.

There are technically 4 different tiers of void items corresponding to their uncorrupted counterparts: '''{{Color|common|Common}}''', '''{{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}''', '''{{Color|legendary|Legendary}}''', and '''{{Color|boss|Boss}}'''. This is relevant for when using the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} (for instance, {{ItemLink|itemName=Needletick}} will appear with items like Encrusted Key and Lost Seer's Lenses, while not being with Benthic Bloom), recycling items with a [[Recycler]], or restacking them with a [[Shrine of Order]].

Chests and other common loot interactables will ''not'' drop void items; the only way to obtain them is from [[Void Cradle]]s found rarely throughout environments. Once can also obtain them using the {{ItemLink|itemName=Encrusted Key}}, but this requires encountering at least one Void Cradle prior. Void items have no equivalent scrap, and can not be used in the [[Scrapper]]. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Void}} void items.

{{#invoke:Items|Table|Void}}

===Untiered===
'''{{Color|untiered|Untiered}}''' items are miscellaneous items which the player is not supposed to interact with. They are items that are either used for internal mechanics, or unreleased concepts that still exist in the game's code and files. See [[Unreleased Items#Items|unreleased items]].

Such items cannot be [[Scrapper|scrapped]], [[Shrine of Order|restacked]], or traded in [[3D Printers]] and [[Cleansing Pool]]s. There are only a few such items that the player can legitimately obtain, but they mostly serve an indication that an event has occured: 

*{{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch (Broken)}}
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend (Consumed)}}
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Empty Bottle}}
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva (Consumed)}}
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Regenerating Scrap (Consumed)}} (used so that the game knows how many to regenerate on the next stage)
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Sale Star (Consumed)}}
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction}} (an item is used for this because the stacks need to persist across stages)
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Unstable Transmitter (Consumed)}}

==Active Items==
An '''active''' item ("Equipment") often provides no benefit unless it is used by the player (as they would one of their skill), which provides a powerful effect but incurs a comparatively lengthy cooldown period during which it (or other active items) cannot be activated. A player can normally hold only one active item at any time; if they try to pick up an active item while they are already holding one, they will swap it for the new one instead. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Equipment}} standard equipment.

===Equipment===
{{#invoke:Items|EquipmentTable|Equipment}}

===Lunar Equipment===
Similar to passive lunar items, lunar equipment can only be obtained from Lunar Pods or the Bazaar Between Time in exchange for Lunar Coins, all with great strength and considerable drawbacks. There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Lunar Equipment}} lunar equipment.

{{#invoke:Items|EquipmentTable|Lunar Equipment}}

===Elite Equipment===
Elite equipment are unique items that grant the player the abilities of [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] enemies. Despite inhabiting the same slots as active items, Elite equipment more closely resemble passive items; their benefits are present at all times while in a player's inventory. As such, players cannot activate Elite equipment, and attempting to activate one does not incur a cooldown period or have a special effect. However, Elite equipment is still restricted to the active item slot, meaning they cannot be stacked and only one may be active at a time. Despite taking up an equipment slot, [[Engineer|Engineer's]] turrets still carry on the effect of the item. An Elite equipment can only be obtained as a rare (1/4000 or 0.025%) drop from its respective Elite monster, although this chance ''is'' affected by [[57 Leaf Clover#Exhaustive List of Clover Effects|Luck]].

Note that Elite equipment appears as regular Orange Command Essence while the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is enabled, however the only option that will be presented is the elite of the enemy that dropped it. Even though they occupy the active item slot, Elite equipment are not subject to the effects of {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}}, and will not change if "used" while it is enabled.

Elite equipment don't have Logbook entry.

There are {{#invoke:Items|TierCount|Elite Equipment}} Elite equipment, corresponding to the variations of Elite enemies.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

When activated, the player gets the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElephantArmorBoost}} buff for 5 seconds, increasing their [[armor]] by 500 points. This effectively gives the player 83.33% damage reduction while active, though this amount may vary slightly depending on the [[Survivors|Survivor's]] natural armor or other armor sources.

== Notes ==
* Running {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T|altText=MUL-T's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool|survivorName=MUL-T}} has some great synergy with this item, as MUL-T will be able to survive otherwise lethal hits while still using another equipment. However, MUL-T will lose out on the damage gained from {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}}, so choose whichever is most appealing.
** Running a permanent uptime {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}} alongside the Elephant affords both strong damage output and incredible survivability, especially if the Elephant has permanent uptime as well. This requires the player to constantly micro-manage equipment swapping, however.
* This item is useful for [[Survivors]] with naturally low health and armor, such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}}, especially when fighting enemies that deal heavy damage. The buff's duration is brief, but this could be enough to save the player's life.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Jellyfish|returning]] airborne [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Jellyfish}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
Jellyfishes spawn on the outskirts of an [[Environments|Environment]] and typically float in place. Once they spot a target, they fly slowly towards it in a typical swimming motion.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 20% of the Jellyfish's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Self-Detonation ===
When the Jellyfish comes close enough to its target, it glows and prepares to explode. After 1 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), it bursts into a large ball of electricity, dealing 1200% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 2.0 in a radius of 10m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot falloff]]. During the detonation sequence the Jellyfish will continue following the trajectory it had before activating the skill. 

Self-exploded Jellyfish do not drop any [[gold]], although they may still drop [[items]] when the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled.

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds. Normally this is irrelevant, but it can come into play if the skill is interrupted.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use secondary''': the Jellyfish must be within 8m from its target. The Jellyfish will ignore the node graph for homing in directly on the target.
# '''Chase while waiting for secondary''': the Jellyfish must be within 8m from its target. Similar to the previous behavior it will home in directly on the target, trying to keep the distance as close as possible to detonate at the first opportunity.
# '''Chase from afar off nodegraph''': the Jellyfish must be within 100m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior also ignores the nodegraph for the most direct pathing. This is not as issue even over cliffs since the Jellyfish is a flyer.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. The Jellyfish will use the node graph to approach its target.

== Tips ==
* While the Jellyfish's explosion does suffer from damage falloff, it can be lethal when it hits for full damage. It can effectively one-shot a [[Survivors|Survivor]] if the Jellyfish is an {{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue|Overloading}} Elite.
* Be wary of {{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite|Glacial}} Elites. Getting caught in the Jellyfish's detonation will {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80|altText=greatly slow}} the player, making them more vulnerable to being completely frozen by the following ice blast. Taking any damage from such an Elite makes fleeing from other nearby Jellyfishes more difficult, making the player an easy target for other enemies.
* Interrupting the detonation of a Jellyfish requires dealing a certain percentage of the health to the enemy in a short period of time, meaning that an Elite Jellyfish's Self-Detonation can be difficult to interrupt.

==Trivia ==
* In the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}}, the in-game message when Jellyfishes first appear incorrectly reads "Jellyfishs have been released from the Cell!" 
** The same error is made when Jellyfishes are spawned from a [[Shrine of Combat]], reading "You have summoned Jellyfishs to fight."

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. Its counterpart is {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}.

When striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more damage, the Band creates a flaming tornado that deals 300% ''(+300% per stack)'' [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|total damage]]. This bonus attack has a cooldown of 10 seconds and a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.0.

== Notes ==
* The runic flame tornado hits targets every 0.3s for 3s within ~5m. 
* In addition to dealing at least 400% damage, a hit must have a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 to activate the Bands. Damage bonuses such as [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strikes]] or {{ItemLink|itemName=Armor-Piercing Rounds}} will ''not'' cause weaker hits to activate the Bands, even if the final damage dealt is above 400% base damage.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary|altText=Mercenary's}} signature {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MercExpose}} debuff is an exception. When Mercenary hits an Exposed enemy, the hit deals an extra 350% damage, which ''does'' count towards the Bands' activation.
* This item always activates simultaneously with Runald's Band.
* The cooldown for the Bands can be seen above the player's health bar as a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElementalRingsCooldown|altText=status effect}} with up to 10 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Bands are {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElementalRingsReady|altText=ready}} and can be activated again.
** Because this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the {{ItemLink|itemName=Blast Shower}} will reset the cooldown immediately.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Ben's Raincoat}} does not provide immunity to this debuff.

* Gameplay Changes
** Runald’s/Kjaro’s Band &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: The two rings have undergone a bit of a rework, working off of an internal cooldown rather than a chance on-hit. We’re hoping that this can help diversify one of our “on-hit” items to be more than just attacking enemies and hoping things activate. We’ve also changed the behavior of Kjaro’s to be more of the AoE option, while Runald’s is the single target option.''
*** Proc Chance: 8% ⇒ 100%
*** Now has an internal cooldown of 10 seconds
*** Now has a minimum threshold of only triggering on attacks that deal 400% or greater damage
*** Fire Tornado Damage: 500% (+250% per stack) ⇒ 300% (+300% per stack)
*** Fire Tornado Hitbox Width: 4.8m ⇒ 13m
*** No longer moves

; [[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update]]
* Gameplay Changes
** Damage: 500% (+250% per stack) additive damage ⇒ 500% (+250% per stack) total damage

; Early Access Release
* Introduced as "8% chance on hit to strike an enemy with a runic flame tornado, dealing 500% additive damage (+250% per stack)."

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a tiny [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

==Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Larva's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: Larval Leap===
The Larva takes a spinning leap into the air, arcing high before coming down and creating a splash of acid that deals heavy damage. Any impact caused 0.3 seconds after leaping will cause an explosion that deals 320% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 7m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]].

The Larva also takes damage equal to 50% of its max health.

The Larva is actually sprinting while leaping, which gives it an impressive 8.0 [[Movement Speed#Body Stats|speed multiplier]], instead of the normal 1.45. Along with the fact that Larvae can maintain motion control and steer while in mid air makes them very hard targets to hit.

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Larva must be within 24m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds.
# '''Strafe sprinting while waiting for primary''': the Larva must be within 24m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds. Combined with the previous behavior, it means that a Larva will only leap every 6 seconds at minimum. However, considering the fact that Larvae can swarm the player, it is very likely there will be multiple leaps to avoid at almost all times.
# '''Chase sprinting off nodegraph''': the Larva must be within 10m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase sprinting''': no requirements. This effectively shows that the Larva will always be sprinting, regardless of what it is doing. As such, its base speed of 1.5m/s is misleading and it actually moves at 12m/s.

== Tips ==
* Larvae may be small, but they spawn in groups, move surprisingly fast, and deal much more damage than their stature would suggest. Without good reaction time or movement items, getting swarmed by Larvae can be a death sentence. 
**However, because Larvae have such low health and their only attack is telegraphed, dealing even a small amount of damage is enough to interrupt the attack and get some breathing room. This still requires a fast reaction (and extra damage output if the Larva is an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]]).

}}

== Trivia==
*There is a bug in multiplayer where, by having a non-host player and the host player die and rejoin in a specific way, a non-host player can start a run as a Larva instead of a Survivor. This occurs because the Larva's internal ID is first in the list of all character IDs, and the game defaults to selecting this first entry when starting a run if a proper Survivor's ID is not chosen for some reason.
*The leap self-damage is actually 25% of the Larva's max health. However, since the friendly fire damage coefficient for the monster team is 2, the Larva effectively takes 50% of its health as damage. Having items that modify the damage upon hit, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal|altText=Focus Crystals}} amplifies this self damage. Therefore, a Larva with more than 90% health and 2 Crowbars will die after the first leap.
**On the other hand, the friendly fire damage coefficient for the player team is 0.5, so a player playing as Larva would only take 12.5% of their health as damage.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

The holder's [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] damage bonus is increased by 100% ''(+100% per stack)''. For example, if the player has one Laser Scope, their critical strikes would deal 3 times the damage of a regular attack, instead of 2 times as much.

== Notes ==
* Since {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|altText=Railgunner's}} critical strike damage increases based on her critical strike chance, this item is equivalent to picking up 10 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} while playing as her.
*When the holder lands a critical strike, a glowing red crosshair appears over the struck enemy for a moment.

== Trivia ==
* The logbook entry is the direct sequel to the [[ror:Telescopic Sight|Telescopic Sight's]] logbook entry from Risk of Rain 1.
* Unlike all other critical-related items, the Laser Scope does ''not'' give any critical strike chance bonus.

The player cannot control their trajectory and will land in a specific place, although additional jumps from having {{ItemLink|itemName=Hopoo Feather|altText=Hopoo Feathers}} or playing as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} or the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} can be used to interrupt the trajectory, giving the player some control over where they land. Additionally, movement skills (such as {{SurvivorLink|Commando|Commando's}} {{SkillLink|Tactical Dive|Commando}} or {{SurvivorLink|Huntress|Huntress's}} {{SkillLink|Blink|Huntress}}) or any skills that affect the player's momentum (such as Huntress's {{SkillLink|Laser Glaive|Huntress}}, {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain|Huntress}}, or {{SkillLink|Ballista|Huntress}}) will interrupt the player's trajectory. (This is not the case for {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} {{SkillLink|Transport Mode|MUL-T}}.)

After being launched from a launch pad, the player cannot input movements until they touch the ground again. This is only relevant when using extra jumps, or when hovering with {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=ENV Suit|survivorName=Artificer}}.

== Notes ==
* [[Monsters]] are able to use launch pads, and will do so to reach the player if required.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret|survivorName=Engineer|altText=TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} are able to use launch pads, and will do so to reach their owner if required.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Leeching Seed|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

Upon damaging an enemy, the holder recovers 1 (''+1 per stack'') health, multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the hit. 

== Notes ==
* Visuals for damage and healing numbers are rounded up, so the Leeching Seed's healing may appear as 1 per hit when in fact it may be lower.
*{{Color|note|Correction:}} Healing is only applied on hit, not on damage.

== Tips ==
* Shotgun attacks such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|Burst|Bandit}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Vulcan Shotgun|Captain}} work well with Leeching Seeds, since each attack fires many individual hits.
** On the other hand, [[Survivors]] with relatively low attack speed or hit count, such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, will struggle to make good use of this item.

* This item becomes generally outclassed by the {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}} once the player has enough [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike chance]]. 
*The hit requirement makes it unsuitable for Damage over Time effects such as poison or bleed.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Lemurian|returning]] lizard-like [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Lemurian}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Lemurian's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Fireball ===
The Lemurian charges a fireball for 0.6 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]). This fireball travels at 45m/s for 5 seconds and upon impact it deals 100% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. This attack has an end lag of 0.5 seconds, which also scales with attack speed.

This skills has no cooldown. 

=== Secondary: Swipe Attack ===
The Lemurian bites at its target, which has an attack animation of 1 second (scales with attack speed).

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second, deals 200% damage, and has a proc coefficient of 1.0.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use secondary and chase slowing down''': the Lemurian must be within 3m from its target and have line of sight. The skill is not necessary to be off cooldown and the Lemurian will chase its target directly without relying on the node graph points. This behavior lasts for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use secondary and chase''': this has the same requirements and actions as the previous behavior, with the only difference that the Lemurian must be within 6m from its target and it will chase at normal speed.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Lemurian must be within 15-30m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Strafe while waiting for the primary''': the Lemurian must be within 15-30m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Lemurian must be within 7m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* Both the Lemurian's attacks can be easily avoided through a dodge or sprinting.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Ror:Lens-Maker's Glasses|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The item increases the player's [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] chance by 10% ''(+10% per stack''). 

== Notes ==
* Critical strikes are reflected by a sharper hit sound and a red tint on the damage numbers, if they are enabled.
* Lens-Maker's Glasses have an [[Item Stacking|effective stacking limit]] of 10. At 10 stacks a critical strike chance is guaranteed, effectively doubling all damage output.
** Acquiring more than 10 stacks will bring no additional benefit unless the player is planning to eventually corrupt it to {{ItemLink|itemName=Lost Seer's Lenses}}.

* Critical strike chance is affected by [[Luck]].
* Critical strikes applies to the damage dealt by equipment, such as the {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}.

* Critical strike chance is '''not''' affected by the damage source's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. As an example, those using {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} {{SkillLink|Auto-Nailgun|MUL-T}} will not have to collect additional Lens-Maker's Glasses to compensate for the skill's lowered chance to proc.

* Critical strikes are calculated ''after'' items like {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}} and {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, doubling their effectiveness.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} has a unique synergy with this item due to her {{SkillLink|Magnetic Accelerator|Railgunner}} passive. Any critical strike chance is converted directly into critical strike damage, meaning this item would instead increase her critical strike damage by 10%. As such, this item can be stacked past 10 stacks and beyond for increased damage.

== Tips ==
* While the effective limit for regular critical hit chance is 10 Lens-Maker's Glasses, it is wise to stop stacking at 9. The first stack of {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}}, {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}} and {{ItemLink|Shatterspleen}} all grant an unspecified 5% increase to critical strike chance, so holding at least two of the three items acts a substitute for a single Lens-Maker's Glasses.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|

* Major Content
** Added New Lore Entry: {{PAGENAME}}
}}

== Trivia ==
* {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts|Predatory Instincts'}} lore entry alludes to players stacking Lens-Maker's Glasses in Risk of Rain 1, claiming that the creature that killed Providence, the final boss of the game, had "22 unblinking, crimson eyes."
** In Risk of Rain 1, Lens-Maker's Glasses did not grant a 10% increase to Critical Strike chance, but rather 7%. Reaching 100% critical strike chance required 14 Lens-Maker's Glasses.

* During the development of Risk of Rain 2, the Lens-Maker's Glasses had a different appearance than they do in the current version of the game.&lt;ref&gt;https://hopoo.tumblr.com/post/166010258719/devblog-7-deferred-rendering-hi-this-last&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''.

During the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], all allies inside the Teleporter's radius are periodically healed by 50% of their maximum health. This effect occurs 1 ''(+1 per stack)'' time(s) per Teleporter Event.

In multiplayer, this item stacks based on the total amount held by all players combined (items held by {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Turrets}} do not count), similar to the {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}.

== Notes ==
* The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the few [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] items that {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets will not inherit.
* Lepton Daisies also activate in all 'holdout zones', including charging the cells in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}, the pillars and rescue dropship on {{EntityLink|entityName=Commencement}}, the deep void signals on {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Locus}}, and the '''Assessment Focus''' in the [[Simulacrum]].
* The item heals consistently at predetermined points in the Teleporter charge when stacked.
** For example, with 2 Lepton Daisies, players will be healed once at 33% charge and again at 66%. With 3, they will be healed at 25%, 50%, and 75%. The intervals between these bursts of healing can be predicted with the equation &lt;code&gt;99/(amount + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
**Because the Soul Pillars on Commencement discharge when no player is within their range, it is possible to trigger the Lepton Daisy at the same charge percentage by dipping in and out of the holdout zone.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Wisp|returning]] floating mask [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2 that is propelled by fire. It is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Wisp}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 10% of the Lesser Wisp's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Lesser Fireballs ===
The Lesser Wisp aims at the player for 1.6 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) before firing 3 fireballs each with a random spread between 0-4. These fireballs are actually bullet attacks with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|default]] falloff and as such they cannot blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}. This attack has an end lag of 2 seconds, which scales with attack speed.

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds and each bullet travels up to 200m, deals 150% damage, has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.33, and has a force of 700.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary and flee''': the Wisp must be within 20m from its target and have line of sight. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Wisp must be within 20-30m from its target and have line of sight. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 2 seconds.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Wisp must be within 40m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior will be active for 2 seconds.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. This behavior will also be active for 2 seconds.

== Tips ==
* While Lesser Wisps on their own are not very threatening, large hordes of them can be very difficult to deal with, especially as a melee [[Survivors|Survivor]].
* Elite Lesser Wisps can be fairly dangerous, as they can consistantly hit the player and afflict [[Status Effects]] such as {{StatusEffectLink|Burn}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Healing Disabled}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|Collapse}}

      <text bytes="8361" sha1="s9wkkgkninhpfopy2wjgj5mp2cp1w1l" xml:space="preserve">'''Level''' is a statistic that all characters have in Risk of Rain 2. The higher a character's level, the higher their stats. As in most games, all characters in Risk of Rain 2 begin at level 1 and steadily level up, becoming progressively stronger over time. 

The level of a character affects their:

* Base [[Health|maximum health]]
* Base [[Health#Regaining Health|health regeneration]]
* Base [[damage]]

It is important to note that these three stats don't all level up at the same rate, health increases by 30% of the base stat while damage and regeneration increase by 20% of their base stats (Though most monsters have 0 regeneration to begin with and as such will not increase when gaining levels). This means that, with no items and at higher levels, fights will tend to take longer as entities gain more health than damage (an effect which is further amplified when the player's levels begin to stagnate).

== Player Level ==
Players level up by gathering '''experience'''. The biggest source of experience is from defeating [[monsters]], which drop whitish-blue experience orbs when killed that are automatically collected by the player that kills them. The amount of experience dropped depends on the current [[Difficulty#Scaling Difficulty|difficulty]], the type of monster, and whether the monster is an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]]. The experience collected by the killing player will be equally received by every other player. As such, a kill from a [[Interactables#Drones|drone]] will also grant experience to the player. However, if a monster is killed by a non-player entity, e.g., fall damage, or the [[Void Fog]], that experience is lost. An exception to this is an enemy dying from falling off the stage. In this scenario the experience will be rewarded to whoever last damaged the aforementioned enemy, however long ago that had occured. This will most likely be the player as there are very few non-player sources of damage. 

Aside from killing monsters, players can acquire small amounts of experience by opening [[barrel]]s. Additionally, when proceeding to the next stage via [[Teleporter]] or portal, all of the player's leftover [[gold]] is converted into half that much experience before entering the next stage.

A player's current level can be found using the formula &lt;math&gt;level = log_{1.55}(1+0.0275*totalexp)+1&lt;/math&gt;, with a minimum of 1. The amount of experience required to reach a certain level can be found with &lt;math&gt;exp = -4/0.11*(1-1.55^{level-1})&lt;/math&gt;. 

Since each subsequent level requires 1.55 times as much experience as the previous one, leveling up outside of early stages becomes nearly impossible. Ultimately, players require [[items]] to survive and fight on.

== Ambient Level ==
Non-player characters use a completely different leveling system than players, instead scaling their level with the ambient difficulty. This ''ambient level'' is given by the formula &lt;math display="inline"&gt;enemyLevel = 1 + (coeff - playerFactor) / 0.33&lt;/math&gt;, where ''coeff'' is the difficulty coefficient and ''playerFactor'' is a constant that scales with the player count of the game (see [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|the math behind scaling difficulty]]). This level is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen, alongside the current scaling difficulty. This level is capped at 99 for the default and any [[Alternate Game Modes|alternate]] game modes. However, [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] is an exception since it both uses its own level formula and also the level is capped at 9999.

A monster's level also determines how much experience it will drop for a player that kills it; the experience reward is found with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;reward = coeff \times monsterValue \times rewardMultiplier&lt;/math&gt;. The experience yield of a monster is exactly half the amount of gold it drops.

Although this level system is used primarily for monsters, nearly all non-player characters, including player minions, use the ambient level. Player minions will use the player team level (the one shown by the player's hp bar) or the ambient level, whichever is greater at the moment. There are a few exceptions: 

* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}} and {{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret}} use the player level because the inherited items should be sufficient for a power boost.
* {{ItemLink|The Back-up|Strike Drones}} summoned by the player also use the player level, which is most likely a bug. However, Strike Drones summoned by [[Equipment Drone]]s or by {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}} do scale with the ambient level since their summoner also does.
* Allied {{MonsterLink|Lemurian|Lemurians}} and {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians}} spawned through the {{ArtifactLink|Devotion}} use the player level as well, but the items they are given will more than make up for their lower stats.
* The following enemies, even though hostile to players, do not scale with the ambient level because they are spawned by special means: the unique {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians}} in {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct|Abandoned Aqueduct's}} secret area, the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}, and any {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infenstors}} that '''specifically''' come out of killed {{StatusEffectLink|Voidtouched}} enemies.

== Trivia ==

* The game uses a 64-bit integer to track the accumulated required experience up to any level. Since 94 is the highest level before the integer overflows, this is technically the highest level achievable by the player.
** This is not normally achievable since if the player keeps [[Environments#Looping|looping]] to continue farming monsters, the difficulty coefficient will grow so much that the credits received by the [[Directors|Director]] will overflow to negative and will be unable to spawn any monsters. It is possible to keep collecting gold from barrels, or by using {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} with {{ItemLink|itemName=Ghor's Tome}}, or by using {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} before enemies stop spawning, and then trade this gold for experience before leaving a stage. However, the exponential growth of the experience required for each new level ensures this is beyond realistic to continue levelling up after enemies stop spawning.
* The game actually keeps track of the experience gathered for all the various teams, i.e., Neutral, Player, Monster, and Void. Enemies and allies scaling by the ambient level do so with the use of a hidden item, which overrides the relevant team's actual level. As discussed in the ambient level section, some special spawns do not scale with the ambient level, which means they will be at the respective team level, which will most likely be 1. However, since any team is hostile to every other team, it is possible for the Monster and Void teams to acquire experience from killing each other.
** The player and drones do not reward experience upon death.
** Using the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is another way to orchestrate enemies killing each other and acquire experience, even if it is from friendly fire. This is noticeable in {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Bulwark's Ambry}} where the Artifact Reliquary's health bar visually indicates when it levels up from monsters killing each other.
** While the death implosion of {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver|altText=Void Reavers}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Jailer|altText=Void Jailers}}, and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Devastator|altText=Void Devastators}} can kill friendlies, the experience orbs cannot reach the offending entity since it has been destroyed. As such, these kills will never grant experience.
*** The same applies for the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Jellyfish|altText=Jellyfish's}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Larva|altText=Larva's}} suicide attacks with the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}}.
*Characters that follow the ambient level choose the higher value between the ambient level and their team's level. Considering most non-player teams rarely level up, this is only relevant for player [[Monsters#Other Monsters|allies]] and [[Interactables#Drones|drones]] in difficulties lower than [[Difficulty#Monsoon|Monsoon]] where the player level can stay ahead of the ambient level for a limited amount of time.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

After all other cooldown reduction and [[Damage|attack speed]] modifiers are applied to the holder, this item reduces ''both'' their final attack speed and final cooldowns. Cooldowns are reduced by 50% (''-50% per stack''), while attack speed is multiplied by &lt;code&gt;1/(stacks + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of halving attack speed per stack is incorrect. Only the first stack reduces attack speed by half; subsequent stacks have a lower penalty.
* Because the Light Flux Pauldron's modification applies after all other changes, it makes attack speed bonuses less effective, and offers less of a cooldown reduction in the presence of other items that provide cooldown reductions.
*After applying the attack speed penalty, the game checks whether the value is less than 0.1 and sets it to that. Therefore, 9+ stacks will have the same effect on attack speed, assuming a starting value of 1.0.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} can make good use of this item, as its utility skills ({{SkillLink|Caustic Leap}}/{{SkillLink|Frenzied Leap}}) and {{SkillLink|Epidemic}} are not affected by attack speed. With a couple Light Flux Pauldrons, these skills can be rapidly used to great effect.
** However, {{SkillLink|Vicious Wounds}}, {{SkillLink|Neurotoxin}}, and {{SkillLink|Ravenous Bite}} fire much more slowly, making them much less reliable.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}} is an excellent candidate for a Light Flux Pauldron because she is mostly cooldown-based. Her primary skills ({{SkillLink|skillName=Flame Bolt}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Plasma Bolt}}) see great benefit from this item: just one stack will nearly allow for continuous firing of either primary skill. Both {{SkillLink|skillName=Snapfreeze}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Ion Surge}} also benefit profoundly from cooldown reduction.
**{{SkillLink|skillName=Flamethrower}} is severely weakened because attack speed determines its number of damage ticks per second, making it the lesser choice over {{SkillLink|skillName=Ion Surge}} when carrying any stacks of Light Flux Pauldron.
**Both secondary skills ({{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Cast Nano-Spear}}) charge much more slowly. The {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb}} is hurt worst, since {{SkillLink|skillName=Cast Nano-Spear}} still provides the utility of freezing foes and executing low-health foes without needing to be fully charged.
***Arguably, despite lowering their charge rate, a Light Flux Pauldron makes these abilities easier to use because they can be held for much longer without fully charging and automatically firing. To see any regular benefit from either secondary ability, it is recommended to take no more than one Light Flux Pauldron, as the charge rate and firing animation can become intolerably slow.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}} sees mixed results with this item. His primary skills ({{SkillLink|skillName=Burst}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Blast}}) fire as quickly as the player can click, but are still negatively affected since they will take longer to reload with lower attack speed. Although {{SkillLink|skillName=Smoke Bomb}} can be used to give a nearly permanent uptime of stealth with just one stack of this item, it does not deal much damage. His secondary skills  ({{SkillLink|skillName=Serrated Dagger}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Serrated Shiv}}) and specials ({{SkillLink|skillName=Lights Out}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado}}) can be used more often, but the reduction in attack speed hampers their usefulness by making the firing animations of all of these abilities much slower.
** The cooldown of his special skill ({{SkillLink|skillName=Lights Out}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado}}) is paused while he is firing it, meaning that the benefit of reducing their cooldown is offset by the drawback of delaying the start of their cooldown.&lt;sup&gt;(This needs testing)&lt;/sup&gt;
** {{SkillLink|skillName=Lights Out}} already fully resets itself and all of his abilities (and fully reloads his primary skill) when it executes a target, making Light Flux Pauldron especially ineffective with this skill.
* Similarly to Bandit, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}}' kit changes drastically with this item. While it does hamper both {{SkillLink|skillName=Strafe}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Flurry}}'s rate of fire significantly and slows down {{SkillLink|skillName=Laser Glaive}}'s startup animation, it does allow the player to spam their secondary, utility and special (particularly {{SkillLink|skillName=Ballista}}) abilities much more often. Taking this item essentially sacrifices the effectiveness of proc coefficient-dependant items and sustained damage for extra mobility and a more bursty damage output.
* This item is excellent for {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}}, as just a single Pauldron will reduce the cooldown from 40s to 20s. The cast time of his {{SkillLink|skillName=Orbital Supply Beacon}} will increase slightly, but is not that detrimental due to its limited use.
**Keep in mind that Captain's {{SkillLink|skillName=Vulcan Shotgun}} will charge slower and have longer ending lag, however.
* This item is difficult to use effectively on Survivors that scale heavily with attack speed.
** Assuming {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}} has no attack speed increases and a single Light Flux Pauldron, his {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppressive Fire}} bullet count is reduced to a measly 3 bullets.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Bouncing Grenades}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Pressure Mines}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Spider Mines}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Thermal Harpoons}} are all affected by attack speed.
*** Just one Light Flux Pauldron allows for permanent uptime of {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield}}.
*** Although his special skills ({{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret}}) can be placed or replaced much more frequently with the reduced cooldown, they will inherit this item and suffer from the poor attack speed. This makes them better candidates for strategies that rely on their disposability, such as using the {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Array}}.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic|altText=Heretic's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Hungering Gaze}} gets a longer cooldown and more bullets by stacking {{ItemLink|itemName=Visions of Heresy}}. While it may seem useful to reduce the cooldown again using the Light Flux Pauldron, the decreased attack speed makes it more practical to just use one stack of Visions of Heresy instead.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary|altText=Mercenary's}} signature {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MercExpose}} [[Debuffs|debuff]] leaves little use for this item, as hitting exposed enemies reduces skill cooldowns by 1 second. Even without this item, a skilled Mercenary player can constantly cycle through skills.
***Using {{SkillLink|Slicing Winds|Mercenary}} isn't affected by the negative attack speed, unlike {{SkillLink|Eviscerate|Mercenary}}; making Slicing Winds more preferable if you are getting Pauldrons.
***Interestingly, by using more Light Flux Pauldrons, Mercenary will stay in his {{SkillLink|skillName=Blinding Assault}} and{{SkillLink|skillName=Focused Assault}} state for a much longer amount of time than normal.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner|altText=Railgunner's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=XQR Smart Round System}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=M99}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=HH44}} all fire much slower. {{SkillLink|skillName=Supercharge}} not only takes longer to charge, but also disables her weapons for longer.
*** {{SkillLink|skillName=Active Reload}} scales with attack speed, changing the size of the perfect reload zone.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} isn't a bad pick with this item, as her {{SkillLink|skillName=Grapple Fist}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Spiked Fist}} do not scale with attack speed, enabling incredible mobility. However, her barrier gain is significantly impacted, as {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Gauntlet}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Thunder Gauntlet}} take longer to charge and {{SkillLink|skillName=Knuckleboom}} attacks slower.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T|altText=MUL-T's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Blast Canister}} scales with attack speed, but can be immediately fired by sprint cancelling. {{SkillLink|skillName=Transport Mode}} does not scale with attack speed, so the Light Flux Pauldron allows using both in quick succession for a very high damage rate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_jbveqJwZY&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} with just one Light Flux Pauldron can achieve greater damage per second early on with {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Drill}}. {{SkillLink|skillName=Tangling Growth}} can be maintained 100% of the time with ease thanks to the Pauldron's cooldown reduction, enabling excellent crowd control and healing.
**However, the firing speed of {{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Inject}} is reduced, which hampers its damage and self-healing over time.
**With enough Light Flux Pauldrons, the cast time for their utility skills ({{SkillLink|skillName=DIRECTIVE: Disperse}}/{{SkillLink|skillName=Bramble Volley}}) becomes high enough that REX can walk around during the delay between activating and actually firing the skill.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}} is terrible with the Light Flux Pauldron, as all its damaging skills are affected by lower attack speed. {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppress}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Corrupted Suppress}} also take longer to cast, and have no cooldowns to begin with.

== Math ==
Skills' new cooldowns are determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;cooldown ⋅ 0.5 ^ amount&lt;/code&gt;. Note that the minimum cooldown for most skills is 0.5 seconds.

The holder's final attack speed, however, is determined differently, with the formula &lt;code&gt;attackSpeed ⋅ 1/(amount + 1)&lt;/code&gt;.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Trivia ==
* The item's lore entry seems to refer to its function. Its reduction of firing rate will make fights generally take longer, but since the majority of survivors have at least one movement-related skill with a cooldown, the cooldown reduction will often make it easier to dodge attacks, and perhaps more notably, flee from unfavorable fights that may result from the player's reduced offensive capabilities. The last line of the lore seems to caution against relying on this hit-and-run style too much, as the limited size of each stage naturally means that the whole map could eventually fill up with all the enemies a player keeps running from.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]'', dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Grovetender}}. 

While the holder is sprinting, they periodically shoot homing wisps at enemies, dealing 300% (''+300% per stack'') damage per wisp. The speed at which the wisps are fired increases as movement speed increases.

The wisps have a range of 40m and a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Math ==
{{Color|note|Correction:}} While the in-game description stating the initial rate of 1.6 seconds would be correct for a speed of 7m/s, the calculation uses your sprinting speed to determine the rate of fire. Each [[Survivors|Survivor]] has a sprinting speed of 10.15m/s (except for {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}} who has 11.6m/s), so the initial rate is one wisp every 1.15 seconds (1.01 seconds for Heretic).
The time in seconds between each fired wisp is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;35 / (3 &amp;sdot; movementSpeed)&lt;/code&gt;

== Tips ==
* This item is most useful on [[Survivors]] that have the {{Keyword|u|Agile}} keyword on their skills, such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}}, allowing them to sprint constantly while using their skills and gain many bonus attacks from the Little Disciple.
* Despite their movement, {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret|Engineer|TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} do not benefit from this item, as they are not sprinting.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

An incredibly mobile and heavy cargo loader, the Loader is capable of delivering some of the hardest-hitting attacks in the game. When utilizing velocity to her advantage, she is able to topple many powerful monsters in just a single punch. 

Completing the [[Guidance Offline]] challenge will unlock Loader as a playable survivor.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use special''': Loader must be within 25m from the target and be aiming at it.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': Loader must be within 2m from the target. Loader will sprint, a new behavior will be selected after this, and it cannot be chosen twice in a row.
# '''Use primary and chase''': Loader must be within 6m from the target. Loader will sprint, a new behavior will be selected after this, and it cannot be chosen twice in a row. Due to the previous behavior, this will only be selectable for the 2-6m distance range.
# '''Use secondary and strafe''': Loader must be within 60m from the target and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and it cannot be selected twice in a row. Loader will sprint for its duration.
# '''Use utility''': Loader must be within 12-20m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and it cannot be selected twice in a row. Loader will sprint for its duration.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips==

* Items that increase damage or attack speed are invaluable on {{Color|loader|Loader}}, especially [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] items. In combination with her {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}}, items such as {{ItemLink|Ukulele}} and {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} substantially increase her damage output.
** While higher attack speed is useful for filling up {{Color|loader|Scrap Barrier}} quickly and dealing damage with procs, be mindful that {{Color|loader|Knuckleboom}} knocks smaller enemies away with every hit. With higher attack speed values, its damage may suffer simply because enemies are constantly being pushed out of reach. This is a non-issue against larger enemies or bosses.
* {{Color|loader|Knuckleboom}} briefly stuns and knocks back lighter enemies such as {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lemurian|altText=Lemurians}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle|altText=Beetles}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Imp|altText=Imps}}, and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Hermit Crab|altText=Hermit Crabs}}.
* {{Color|loader|Grapple Fist}} &amp; {{Color|loader|Spiked Fist}} only go on cooldown if the attack connects with an enemy or terrain; if not, it reels back in and is immediately ready for re-use. 
** However, hitting an enemy at the very limit of {{Color|loader|Spiked Fist's}} range will not trigger the grappling effect or put the skill on cooldown, but will still deal damage. This may be a bug.
* It is possible to charge up {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} while attached to something by {{Color|loader|Grapple Fist}} or {{Color|loader|Spiked Fist}}. Use this to gain damage when using {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}}, as its damage is increased by {{Color|loader|Loader's}} movement speed. On top of dealing massive amounts of damage, it can also allow her to cover great distances very quickly.
* Release {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} at the apex of {{Color|loader|Grapple Fist's}} trajectory (right when {{Color|loader|Loader}} starts going upwards) to maintain maximum momentum when trying to go far.
* The momentum imparted by either utility skill can fling light monsters away, e.g., {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}}, which can kill them instantly if they are slammed against a wall or thrown out of bounds.
* When attached to something with {{Color|loader|Grapple Fist}} or {{Color|loader|Spiked Fist}}, repeatedly toggling sprint can rapidly increase {{Color|loader|Loader's}} movement speed and/or swinging radius (distance between {{Color|loader|Loader}} and what she's attached to). The swinging radius can extend infinitely, being limited only by the boundaries of the map.
* {{Color|loader|Loader}} can move faster while using {{Color|loader|Knuckleboom}} by pressing the sprint key between attacks.
* {{Color|loader|Scrap Barrier}} gives {{Color|loader|Loader}} barriers when hitting enemies with {{Color|loader|Knuckleboom}}, {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}}, and {{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}}, but not {{Color|loader|M551 Pylon}} or {{Color|loader|Thunderslam}}.
*{{Color|loader|Scrap Barrier}} also synergizes well with {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}} and {{ItemLink|Aegis}}, the latter of which can make great use of {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}} and {{ItemLink|Leeching Seed}}.
*{{Color|loader|Loader}} makes exceptional use of the {{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}}, as she is more than capable of meeting the height requirement for its max damage. Additionally, she can use the fall speed increase to gain more velocity for {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} and {{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}}.
*{{Color|loader|Loader}} pairs well with the {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}, as a large chunk of her damage comes from her utility skill. 
**This also significantly augments her mobility, allowing her to use {{Color|loader|Charged}} and {{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}} to move around even more easily.
*While {{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}} technically is stronger than {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} early on (2100%+1000% compared to 2700%), {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} eventually eclipses it thanks to its piercing property, and because the extra 1000% from {{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}} does not benefit from the {{keyword|u|Heavy}} damage bonus. As enemies become more plentiful, {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} can plow through them and deal its full damage to each, as opposed to {{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}} only dealing its full damage to a single enemy.
*{{Color|loader|Thunder Gauntlet}} works well with {{Color|loader|Thunderslam}}, as the ricochet from hitting a target can be used to follow up with a slam, though {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}} can work as well since it can be used to pierce into the center of a group of enemies.
*Using [[Bandolier]] works well with Charged Gauntlet, as you collect the pickup drop when going through the enemy.
*The equipment {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}}, allows for the unlock of {{Color|loader|Thunderslam}} by killing the clone it summons three times. This can be easily done through the use of crowbars and a fully charged {{Color|loader|Charged Gauntlet}}

==Trivia == 
*'''Loader''' was one of the two post-launch playable characters in the first Risk of Rain.
*The Loader's "Classic" skin is a reference to Risk of Rain 1, as it has the same color scheme as the original Loader.  It may also be a reference to the Power Loader suit in the movie ''Aliens''.
*The Loader in Risk of Rain 2 is female, while the [[ror:Loader|Loader in Risk of Rain 1]] is male.
*Due to being immune to fall damage, the {{ArtifactLink|Frailty}} has no effect on Loader.
*Contrary to her game description, Loader is one of the most mobile survivors in the game.
*Loader is often considered the most powerful early-game and overall character in game due to her survivability, burst power, mobility, and low reliance on items.
* Loader’s lore entry states that her suit is capable of lifting 250 tons, equivalent to the weight of 71 elephants or 125 cars. 
**Moving at 300mph (the requirements to complete [[Loader: Earthshatter]]) would be the equivalent of being hit by a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport. Using a special calculator, moving at 300mph whilst using Charged Gauntlet would amount to 2000 tons of force, equivalent to 13 whales or 2 football stadiums. However, that answer was reached using the weight of the average adult female (170 pounds) and not the weight of the Loader gear itself. If using the Loader Gear for measurement instead, punches at 300mph would be the equivalent to 5,729,489 tons of force!

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} by landing a {{SkillLink|Charged Gauntlet|Loader}} hit at 300mph or higher.

== Tips ==
* An easy way to do this is by punching downward while in the air.
* Another way to do this in an environment that has launch pads. Make sure a monster is on the other side of a launch pad's trajectory and fully charge the gauntlet before taking the launch pad.
* Yet another way of doing is this is to use {{SkillLink|skillName=Grapple Fist|survivorName=}} to pull Loader towards an enemy, releasing a fully charged punch right before clinging to the target.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} by reaching and proceeding through the [[A Moment, Fractured#Celestial Portal|Celestial Portal]] in 25 minutes or less.

== Tips ==
* To complete this challenge, the player must skip the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} boss fight to continue the run and [[Looping|loop]]. There are three ways to do this:
** Interact with the prongs on the outside of the [[Teleporter#Primordial Teleporter|Primordial Teleporter]] found on {{EntityLink|Sky Meadow}}. This aligns it to the planet, so that entering will send the player to either {{EntityLink|Titanic Plains}}, {{EntityLink|Distant Roost}} or {{EnvironmentLink|Siphoned Forest|displayIcon=true}}, instead of the {{EntityLink|Commencement|final stage}}.
** Interact with a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] on Sky Meadow, then enter the resulting Blue Portal to go to the {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time}}.
** Input an artifact code at the [[Sky Meadow#Compound Generator|Compound Generator]] underneath Sky Meadow and complete an artifact trial in {{EntityLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}.
* Players attempting this challenge should also know that:
** The challenge goes by the in-game timer, not real time, thereby allowing players to visit environments where time is paused, such as {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, {{EntityLink|Gilded Coast}}, or {{EntityLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}. 
** Loader is very powerful and can survive with minimal items.
** Playing on {{EntityLink|Drizzle}} difficulty is highly recommended to reduce the chance of death.
** Look for glowing particles in the air when spawning on a new stage. They will reveal the location of the [[Teleporter]] from just about anywhere on the map.
** By inputting a code in Sky Meadow, it is possible to skip the charging of the Teleporter and associated boss fight, thus saving the player time.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} by killing 3 other Loaders in the [[Bulwark's Ambry]].

== Tips ==
* Play as Loader and head to the [[Sky Meadow]], inputting the code for the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}}.
** Since an Umbra will spawn each time the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}} is interacted with, except for the last interaction, simply kill all 3 Loader Umbrae while completing the Trial.
* For more detailed tips on surviving this artifact, refer to the [[Artifacts#Vengeance|Vengeance]] section.
* Avoid offensive [[Interactibles#Drones|drones and turrets]], as these can kill Umbrae. If they do, it will ''not'' count towards the 3 Loaders the player needs to kill.
* It is notable that holding {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}} will give all Umbrae an extra life, allowing the player to get credit for up to two kills per Umbra. This can be useful as insurance in case an Umbra is killed by something else, although this strategy can be dangerous if the Umbra is powerful.
*This challenge can also be achieved through killing the summoned creature from the equipment {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}} three times with the code for {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}}, or with the artifact of Chaos active while doing a different input code.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion.

On level up gain a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Free Unlocks|altText=free unlock}} ''(+1 unlock per item stack)'' for the next purchase but all [[gold]] is converted to experience. Anything that costs gold is increased by 50% ''(+50% per item stack)''. For gold collected equal to the price of a [[Chests#Small Chest|small chest]], it is converted to 12% ''(+1.25% per stack)'' of the experience required for the next level.

==Notes==
*Any gold collected is converted to a percentage of the experience required for the next level according to &lt;math&gt;\frac{gold}{smallChestCost} \times (0.12 + (0.0125 \times (stacks - 1)))&lt;/math&gt;. For example, on the first stage for 1 stack every 25 gold collected the player gains 12% of the experience required for the next level. Since this is independent of the current level, it makes it easier to accumulate experience for the higher levels whose requirements grow exponentially.
**The item scaling is capped at 8 stacks, where the 25 gold from the previous example would be converted to 20.75% of experience for the next level.
*The XP gains and levels are linked between all players in multiplayer.
*The [[Difficulty#Effect on money costs|cost]] of a small chest is calculated at the beginning of a stage, whereas the rate of gold received from killing monsters can increase during the stage as the [[Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]] grows.
**As the difficulty coefficient increases, the number of monsters that spawn and the gold they reward scales much faster than the cost of a small chest. If the player has [[Environments#Looping|looped]] a few times, a single kill can reward enough gold to buy the whole stage many times over. In such a scenario a single kill can result in multiple levels gained at once. However, this will only grant one buff of {{StatusEffectLink|Free Unlocks}} for the whole level up event and not for each individual level gained.
*The free unlocks awarded per level up are capped at 3.
**Since the max player level is 94, one can obtain at most 279 buff stacks.
***It is possible to softlock your run in the {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}} by reaching the max level before activating all the [[Gilded Coast|Halcyon Beacons]], unless there is a player without Longstanding Solitude.
*Any unspent free unlocks transfer between stages.
*Interacting with anything that normally costs gold but is made to cost {{Color|u|$0}} with {{SkillLink|Beacon: Hacking}} still uses a charge of this buff if the player has any. This includes the skill interacting to perform the purchase.
*Longstanding Solitude makes it impossible to complete the [[Halcyon Shrine]], as the player's gold is converted to experience before it can be drained by the shrine. However, the shrine can still be activated to spawn a single wave of {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golems}}.
*If the player with Longstanding Solitude is dead in a multiplayer game while the team levels up, they will not be rewarded any free unlocks.

* Pairing this with items like the {{ItemLink|Roll of Pennies}}, {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, or {{ItemLink|Ghor's Tome}} can drastically increase the gold you earn and the rate you earn levels.
** Brittle Crown in particular has no downside when paired with this item.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Aurelionite's Blessing}} combined with high fire-rating survivors can produce enough gold nuggets that the player can attain and maintain a higher level than monsters.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Wake of Vultures}} can also be useful in a similar vein by occasionally gaining the elite's power.
* Spending a free unlock to purchase a [[Chests#Legendary Chest|Legendary Chest]] is a great use of this item. Combining this with {{ItemLink|Sale Star}} also increases the number of red items one can collect whilst not spending any time to farm for the necessary gold.
* With the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} there is very little downside to this item since the need for gold purchases are minimal.
* Due to the more frequent level-ups, {{ItemLink|itemName=Warbanner}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Prayer Beads}} synergize well with Longstanding Solitude.
* Since the player only gets a limited amount of purchases, without excessive farming to fully loot a stage some interactables and money-based items can be less prioritised.
** While drones and turrets can provide useful support, they arguably provide less of a benefit than items while they are also very prone to dying during any of the final bosses. Avoiding them also makes {{ItemLink|itemName=Empathy Cores}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}} less effective.
** [[Shrine of Chance|Shrines of Chance]] can needlessly waste purchase activations. Avoiding them also means {{ItemLink|itemName=Chance Doll}} has no value.
**While the {{ItemLink|itemName=Executive Card}} can still allow to purchase multiple useful items from a single multishop, using it for its cashback mechanic is pointless. Furthermore, once the player has exhausted all possible free unlocks, this equipment should be swapped for another one.
**It's unlikely the player would make extensive use of the{{ItemLink|itemName=Remote Caffeinator}}. However, it can still be useful on any of the final stages since there is little other use for any unspent free unlocks.
**Any [[:Category:InteractableRelated Items|InteractableRelated items]].
**It is impossible to gain any further {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Extra Boss Missile}} stacks beyond the first five, effectively cutting the effectiveness of {{ItemLink|itemName=War Bonds}} to 1/4th.
*While in singleplayer the only drawback is the limited number of free unlocks, in multiplayer for any player that does not hold a Longstanding Solitude, the cost of money-based interactables is increased, making it harder to buy anything.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of the {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}.

Upon hitting a non-boss enemy, there is a 0.5% (''+0.5% per stack'') chance to instantly kill it, multiplied by the attack's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. This chance is affected by [[luck]].

==Notes==
*Obtaining 200 Lost Seer's Lenses causes every hit with a proc coefficient of at least 1.0 to result in an instant kill on all non-boss monsters.
*A non-boss enemy counts as anything without a red health bar. A "boss" should ''not'' be confused with [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monsters]] or monsters holding {{ItemLink|Infusion}}, which has the same red health bar, but are not designated as bosses.
**Red health bars can appear for [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] bosses, [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Bosses]], {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|Invading Doppelgangers}}, and [[Simulacrum]] boss waves; {{PAGENAME}} will be ineffective against these enemies.
** Since the Lost Seer's Lenses are ineffective against boss enemies and the {{ItemLink|Armor-Piercing Rounds}} ''only'' work on boss enemies, Armor-Piercing Rounds can help make up the lost damage against bosses.
*When the player hits an enemy and the instant-kill roll succeeds, it adds a Void Death damage type to the attack, similar to the {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reaver's}} implosion, which causes instant death with a unique visual of inflicting massive damage. Because the {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}} inherits the damage type of the triggering hit, if the attack that activates the Behemoth succeeds the instant-kill roll, then the Behemoth's explosion will ''also'' instantly kill anything it hits. 
** This also allows the player to instantly kill bosses because they are also vulnerable to the instant-kill damage type. For example, by instantly killing an enemy that is sufficiently close to a boss, the Behemoth's explosion can transfer this instant-kill roll. However, {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} and {{MonsterLink|Voidling}} are immune to Void Death effects, so this scenario does not work on them.

==Tips ==
*Having {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover|57 Leaf Clovers}} can greatly improve the rate of instant killing.
*Instantly killing a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Gup}} will prevent it from splitting into {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Geep}}. Other enemy on-death effects are unaffected however.
*When carrying a large quantity of Lens-Maker's Glasses alongside critical-related items (e.g. {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}), picking up the Lost Seer's Lenses may end up being detrimental. 
**The player can make up for lost critical chance by using the {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD}}, though only while the buff is active.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Backstab}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner|altText=Railgunner's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Magnetic Accelerator}} can still consistently allow for the effects of critical-related items without needing {{ItemLink|itemName=Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, making this item more viable for them.
***For Bandit, instant kills triggered by {{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado}} will grant a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BanditSkull|altText=Desperado Stack}} and instant kills triggered by {{SkillLink|skillName=Lights Out}} will reset cooldowns
**With the exception of Railgunner, having more than 10 Lens-Maker's Glasses (100% crit chance) is often pointless, so corrupting them can be useful if the player has passed that threshold, allowing the player to get the most out of 11+ Lens-Maker's Glasses.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

Activating your secondary skill stores up to 5 charges ''(+1 per stack)''. Requires at least 3 charges for your primary skill to fire lightning strikes, each dealing 175% ''(+50% per stack)'' [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] with a 1.0 [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] in a 7m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]]. The item also reduces the secondary skill cooldown by 20%.

== Notes ==  
* Unlike the lightning strikes from {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} and {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}}, this one does not apply a downwards force which can cause light flyers, e.g., {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}}, to be slammed into the ground.
* The strikes are called individually with a 0.2 second delay each and will strike the same position whether the original target has moved away from its area-of-effect or been killed.
* For survivors like {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} using the secondary skill does not count as bringing up the scope, but actually firing a shot while the scope is enabled. While in this case the primary skill button is pressed, it does not count as a primary skill attack and it does not trigger the extra damage; only {{SkillLink|XQR Smart Round System}} does. 
** This means the player should use the scope when firing either of Railgunner's special skills in order to gain a charge from it.
** Similarly, {{SkillLink|skillName=Ballista}} throws its arrows with the primary skill, but it does not count as one.
** The {{ItemLink|Shuriken}} also does not trigger the buff.
* The charges are not consumed whenever a primary attack is executed, but only when one connects. As such the player should not worry about making sure the attack connects.
** However, the extra charges are granted whenever the secondary skill is executed, whether it connects or not. This is mainly applicable for {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Grapple Fist}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Spiked Fist}}.
* If {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} strikes an enemy only with the third swing of his {{SkillLink|skillName=Laser Sword}} while having at least 3 Luminous Shot charges, the primary hit will apply {{StatusEffectLink|Expose}} which will be immediately consumed by the first lightning strike. Specifically, each lightning strike will proc for &lt;math&gt;1.3 \times baseDamage * (1.25 + 0.5 \times stacks)&lt;/math&gt; damage and since Expose adds &lt;math&gt;3.5 \times baseDamage&lt;/math&gt; to it, the first strike will deal a total of &lt;math&gt;baseDamage \times (5.125 + 0.65 \times stacks)&lt;/math&gt; damage.
* One item stack is sufficient to proc {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band|altText=}}{{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band|altText=the bands}} with {{SkillLink|skillName=Blast}}, while for an attack with 100% base damage, e.g., {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap}}, at least 6 stacks are required.

==Tips==  
*During combat downtime the player is advised to keep executing their secondary skill to build up the charges as long as this does not interfere with other priorities, e.g., making use out of {{StatusEffectLink|Whip Boost}}.
*Luminous Shot is very useful for survivors with a very short secondary attack cooldown and ideally, a powerful primary attack to multiply the damage with:
**{{SurvivorLink|REX}} is a primary example who can rotate between {{SkillLink|Seed Barrage}} and {{SkillLink|DIRECTIVE: Inject}} very quickly.
**{{SurvivorLink|Acrid|Acrid's}} secondary skills also have a 2-second cooldown only.
**Using either of {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader|altText=Loader's}} secondary skills without hitting a target charges the item without putting the skill on cooldown, effectively allowing to reach max charges very quickly.
**{{SkillLink|Scrap Launcher}} as the second primary of choice in {{SkillLink|Power Mode}} can nearly grant full charges with a single barrage, which then reloads fairly quickly. Coupled with the high base damage of {{SkillLink|Rebar Puncher}}, this makes Luminous Shot an essential pickup when dealing with high health enemies whilst running this loadout combination.
** {{SurvivorLink|False Son}}'s {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} usually has a large amount of stocks and a fairly low cooldown. This can be further enhanced with {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} which instantly refreshes a portion of your Lunar Spikes stocks, allowing for even more charges, and {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}}, to be built up. Following this with the {{SkillLink|Club Slam}} can proc Luminous Shot for a lot of damage. Furthermore, by increasing {{Color|h|Growth}} with, {{ItemLink|Bison Steak|Bison Steaks}}, for example, can allow cycling Lunar Spikes and Laser Burst to proc Luminous Shot multiple times in quick succession.

The '''Lunar Chimera''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] that was added in the [[Anniversary Update]], and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} monster family.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills and Behavior==
This Lunar Chimera bounces and rolls around haphazardly like a ball. 

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Lunar Chimera's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement. 

=== Primary: Multishot ===
The Lunar Chimera fires a projectile travelling at 80m/s and upon impact, or after 2.5 seconds, explodes dealing 100% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 2m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff.]]  

{{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can block this projectile.  

This skill has a cooldown of 1s and holds 3 charges. Multiple shots can be fired with a delay of 0.1s and once the skill is recharged all charges are restocked.  

=== Death: Lunar Blaze ===
A moment after the Lunar Chimera dies, it glows brightly before exploding into a flaming blue circle, which lingers and rapidly damages players that stand in it similarly to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mini Mushrum|altText=Mini Mushrum's}} fire pools. The fire pool deals 5 x 120% damage per second for 7 seconds in a 12m radius.

Defensive Microbots can destroy the fire pool if the player is close enough, even before it has actually spawned in.

=== Behaviors ===
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 20m from its target. The skill is not necessary to be off cooldown and the behavior lasts for 3 seconds.
# '''Use primary and chase running''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 70m from its target and have line of sight. The skill is not necessary to be off cooldown and the behavior lasts for 3 seconds.
# '''Chase running''': no requirements. The behavior lasts for 3 seconds.

== Notes ==
* Lunar Chimera killed by the {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}} do not perform the Lunar Blaze attack.

== Version History ==

== Trivia ==
* As the name of the monster suggests, the Lunar Chimera is possibly a combination of 3 different monsters. It bears resemblance to the [[ror:Mechanical Spider|Mechanical Spider]], is somewhat mechanically similar to the {{MonsterLink|Jellyfish}}, and creates a deadly fire field like the Mini Mushrum.
** The Mechanical Spider is a monster from the original Risk of Rain, which walks on the ground and fires electric projectiles towards nearby Survivors. The Chimera echoes this attack pattern four-fold.

The '''Lunar Chimera''' is a [[Monsters|monster]], and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills and Behavior ==
This Lunar Chimera walks and slides around the map, usually using the slide to get closer to its target.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Lunar Chimera's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Twinshot Attack ===
The Lunar Chimera charges his cannons for 3 seconds and then fires 10 explosive balls at 0.15s intervals. Both timings scale with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]. Each projectile moves in wavey pattern at 40m/s and explodes upon impact or after 5 seconds dealing 100% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 8m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot]] falloff. 

The skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds, which starts when the charge up time finishes. 

=== Secondary: Lunar Shell ===
{{Color|Note|Note:}} This content is not functioning within the game.

Bright light flashes surround the Lunar Golem which then make it glow light blue and 4 shields appear rotating around it similar to {{ItemLink|itemName=Rose Buckler|altText=Rose Buckler's}} effect. This is an unused buff called Lunar Shell, which caps any incoming instance of damage to 10% of the holder's max health.

This skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds, which does not start for 2.4 seconds since its activation. This duration scales with attack speed.

=== Behaviors ===
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 80m from its target. The skill is not necessary to be off cooldown and the behavior lasts for 3 seconds.
# '''Use primary and chase''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 80-125m from its target and have line of sight. The skill is not necessary to be off cooldown and the behavior lasts for 1 second.
# '''Chase''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 125m from its target.
# '''Chase running''': the Lunar Chimera must be more than 80m from its target. 

== Notes ==
* The Lunar Chimera has a [[Movement Speed#Body Stats|sprinting coefficient]] of 3.0, which makes it move very fast when it approaches the player from afar. Coupled with the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Perfected}} affix, which increases the enemy's movement speed, makes this one of the fastest moving enemies while sprinting.

==Trivia==
* As the name of the monster suggests, the Lunar Chimera may be a combination of two or more different monsters. It bears a resemblance to both the {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}} and the [[Ror:Temple Guard|Temple Guard]].
** The Temple Guard is a monster featured in the original Risk of Rain. It is notably quadrupedal, with cannons extending from either side of its torso.
*** Coincidentally, similar to how Lunar Chimera spawn during phases of the final boss in Risk of Rain 2, a variant of the Temple Guard named the Sanctuary Guard will spawn during the final phase of the final boss in the original Risk of Rain.
** Prior to the anniversary update, the Lunar Chimera had a carved eye similar to the {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}}. Now it doesn't have an eye at all.
* In the game's credits, a drawing of an item named "Moon Golem's Heart" appears. It is possible that this was intended to be item related to the Lunar Chimera, although this is speculation.

{{MonsterPage}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]], and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} monster family.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills and Behavior==
These Lunar Chimeras float around aimlessly, similarly to Wisps. Even if they acquire a target, they generally will not move much aside from slowly strafing sideways. 

=== Primary: Rapid Fire ===
The Lunar Chimera prepares its weapons for 3.33 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) which is indicated by its weapons spinning. It then opens fire in a similar manner to a {{MonsterLink|Clay Templar}}. It fires a pair of bullets every 0.1 seconds (scales with attack speed) with each bullet dealing 20% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.05. The bullets have a range of 300m and [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]]. The critical strike is calculated once per second and is applied to all the bullets for the duration. 

Even though the damage per bullet is less than the Clay Templar's, the Lunar Chimera's minimal firing spread and ability to fly make it far more dangerous than its counterpart. 

However, in contrast to the Clay Templar, a Chimera Wisp’s attack does not last until the firing button is released but only for 4 seconds. This duration also scales with attack speed. 

The skill has a cooldown of 20 seconds which does not start until the weapons have finished charging. 

===Secondary: Tracking Bomb===
The Lunar Chimera charges a blue orb in front of it and then releases it after 2 seconds (scales with attack speed). This orb moves at 60m/s and homes in on its target. Upon impact it deals 500% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with linear falloff.

This orb has 75 (+22 per level) health, and as such players can attack and destroy it, triggering any [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill effects]] they have. The orb will still explode if destroyed this way, so players should take care to attack it from a safe distance. After 12 seconds without an impact, the orb will self-explode on the spot. This attack can also be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 12 seconds which does not start until the orb has been fired.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Flee''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 30m from its target.
# '''Use secondary''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 30-100m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 80% health. This behavior is active for 1 second, during which the Chimera will stop moving. Charging the tracking bomb takes longer than this, so depending on which behavior is chosen next, the Chimera may continue remaining stationary or start moving again while still charging the attack.
# '''Use primary''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 30-100m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2 seconds, during which the Chimera will stop moving. This behavior can be chosen straight after using the secondary, but since the secondary's charging animation prevents it from using the primary, it will simple remain stationary while still charging the secondary attack.
# '''Chase''': the Lunar Chimera must be at least 45m away from its target.
# '''Strafe''': the Lunar Chimera must be within 30-60m from its target. This behavior is active for 1 second. This means that upon using either the primary or secondary skills, the Chimera may attempt to strafe while still unleashing its attacks.

== Tips ==

* The Lunar Chimera Wisp should be considered the highest priority in a fight. Unlike the Clay Templar, it is not confined to the ground and finding cover from its Rapid Fire is much harder.
* A {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}} Lunar Chimera Wisp is extremely dangerous, as the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}} debuff they inflict will make it difficult to escape their Rapid Fire, if not impossible without sufficient movement speed.
*A {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixVoid}} Lunar Chimera Wisp can spawn on {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Sky Meadow}} in a [[Void Seed|void seed]] during a {{MonsterFamily|familyName=Lunar}} Family Event or be created as a result of a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor}} infesting a Chimera Wisp during a Family event on Sky Meadow or  {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Void Locus}}. Due to the Chimera's high fire rate, it may be able to inflict multiple stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Collapse}}. This can prove devastating to the player, as each stack will deal 80% of the damage that the Chimera's bomb deals.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a currency found in Risk of Rain 2 that the player can use to purchase [[Items#Lunar|lunar items]], unlock the {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} survivor, activate [[Newt Altars]], [[Shrine of Order]], and the [[Bazaar Between Time#Lunar Shop Refresher|Lunar Shop Refresher]]. 

Unlike items or the other form of currency, [[Gold]], Lunar Coins will '''carry over''' between games.

== Obtaining Lunar Coins ==
* Any enemy killed has a 0.5% chance to drop a '''single Lunar Coin''', but each time this happens halves this chance '''during that run'''.
** The [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} has a chance of dropping Lunar Coins in this way.
* Obliterating at an [[A Moment, Fractured#Obelisk|Obelisk]] in the Hidden Realm {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured}} will yield {{LunarCoin|5}}.
** Obliterating while holding {{ItemLink|Beads of Fealty}} will instead advance the player to the Hidden Realm {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}}, where the player must defeat a {{EntityLink|Twisted Scavenger}} for {{LunarCoin|10}} looted from their backpack '''in addition''' to the {{LunarCoin|5}} from obliterating, for a total of {{LunarCoin|15}}.
*** However, a minimum of one [[Lunar Pod]] must be opened to have a chance at the Beads, costing {{LunarCoin|1}} each. Alternatively, the player can visit the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}}, but the Lunar Pods there cost {{LunarCoin|2}} and the Beads are still not guaranteed to appear. Rerolling the shop will significantly cut into the profits of this method.
* Completing the Game by defeating the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}} and escaping successfully will yield {{LunarCoin|10}}.
* Escaping from {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}} by defeating the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} will yield  {{LunarCoin|10}}.

== Trivia ==
* Lunar Coins used to be whole at the start of the Early Access, but were changed later in development along with the icon denoting the amount of coins a player has.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] that spawns on all [[Environments]] (excluding Hidden Realms, but including {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}). The player can pay {{LunarCoin|1}} to the pod, which opens it and drops a *random [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] or [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]] that the player has unlocked.

* *The Item will spawn as an Essence with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} Enabled.

Lunar Pods will not spawn when the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled, except on {{EntityLink|entityName=Commencement}}.

The {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}} contains 5 Lunar Pods, which each display a lunar item above them that will drop when opened. In exchange, these require {{LunarCoin|2}} to open instead of {{LunarCoin|1}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of the {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}}.

The holder gets 1 extra charge (''+1 per stack'') of their special skill, and the cooldown of their special skill is reduced by 33%.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description does not mention the special skill cooldown reduction.

== Tips ==
* This item allows {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} to have three turrets placed simultaneously. Additional stacks of this item further increases the number of charges, but will not allow more than three turrets to be placed at once.
* {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Orbital Supply Beacon}} functions very strangely with Lysate Cells. When first spawning into a new stage, Captain gets one charge of each of his two beacons, then he gets an additional charge of his "Primary" Beacon (Normally tied to M1). Captain's Orbital Supply Beacon can then be used during that stage as long as either of the two beacons have a charge left. However only two of your Beacons can exist on the map at once, placing a third will remove the oldest beacon.
** This means that Lysate Cells will have no effect in the stage that you collected them in.
** The charges on each of the Beacons also reset if you die and respawn, such as from {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} or advancing to the next wave in the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].
** This is most helpful with {{SkillLink|Beacon: Hacking|altText=Hacking Beacons}} and {{SkillLink|Beacon: Resupply|altText=Resupply Beacons}} as these two will get their full benefit again, while {{SkillLink|Beacon: Healing|altText=Healing Beacons}} and {{SkillLink|Beacon: Shocking|altText=Shocking Beacons}} are effectively only moved to their new position.
* While Lysate Cell will allow {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} to use {{SkillLink|Corrupted Suppress}} more than usual, it has no effect while Void Fiend is uncorrupted, since {{SkillLink|Suppress}} can already be used an infinite number of times with no cooldown (as long as Void Fiend has enough corruption to spend).
* Since the Fuel Cell has poor synergy with any equipment that does not benefit from extra charges or cooldowns (such as [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] and the {{ItemLink|Executive Card}}), the player can take a Lysate Cell without any negative effect on their equipment.
* It is not recommended to take this item as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} with Retool since it will result in more charges for it which is useless due to the already low cooldown.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

A modified multi-purpose robot, MUL-T lives up to its designation through its sheer versatility. Highly durable in terms of both high health and armor, it possesses the unique ability to select two of four primary weapons and utilize them in two different configurations: either swapping between two weapons and [[equipment]] via {{Color|mul-t|Retool}}, or utilizing two primary weapons at once in the armored {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}}.

Completing the [[Verified]] challenge will unlock MUL-T as a playable survivor.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use secondary and strafe''': MUL-T must be within 10-35m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use special and stop''': MUL-T must be within 40m from the target and the equipment must be off cooldown. This behavior is active for 0.1 seconds and it cannot be selected twice in a row. A target will be reselected after this. This behavior cannot be selected if MUL-T does not have an equipment in the current slot. If Retool is the selected special and there is no equipment in the alternative slot, MUL-T will be unable to switch back with this behavior. The internal name for this behavior is "SwapWeapons", which seems was conceived before Power Mode was introduced. Even so, the code is not designed for checking whether the equipment is off cooldown in the alternative slot, which would have been a more useful feature. If Power Mode is the selected skill, due to many of the following behaviors force MUL-T to sprint, the mode will be exited prematurely, thus making it an almost useless skill to employ.
# '''Use utility''': MUL-T must be within 10-20m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. MUL-T will also attempt to sprint, which is unncessary as the skill enforces that anyway.
# '''Use primary (Power-Saw) and strafe sprinting''': MUL-T must be within 4m from the target.
# '''Use primary (Power-Saw) and chase sprinting''': MUL-T must be within 20m from the target. Due to the previous behavior this can only be selected for the range 4-20m.
# '''Use primary (Auto-Nailgun)''': MUL-T must be within 12m from the target. MUL-T will attempt to sprint, even though the skill is not agile and the behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use primary (Rebar Launcher) and flee''': MUL-T must be within 20m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it.
# '''Use primary (Rebar Launcher) and chase''': MUL-T must have line of sight to the target and be aiming at it. MUL-T will also attempt to sprint and a target will be reselected after this behavior. Due to the previous behavior, MUL-T will flee if closer than 20m and give chase otherwise.
# '''Use primary (Rebar Launcher) and strafe''': MUL-T must be within 30m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row and a target will be reselected after this. The priority of the previous two behaviors ensures this will never get chosen.
# '''Use primary (Scrap Launcher) and strafe''': MUL-T must be within 30m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row and a target will be reselected after this.
# '''Use primary (Scrap Launcher) and chase''': MUL-T must be within 30m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. A target will be reselected after this. In combination with the previous behavior, which cannot be selected twice in a row, if MUL-T is within 30m from the target, it will effectively alternative between strafing and chasing.
# '''Use special''': no requirements, but this behavior cannot be selected twice in a row. This is the only other way MUL-T can use the special skill. If Retool is selected and the alternative primary is the Rebar Launcher, this behavior will never be selected again because it is preceeded by a behavior which uses Rebar Launcher regardless of what distance is the enemy is at. As such, if MUL-T does not have an equipment in the alternative slot, there will be no way to switch back.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

==Tips==

*MUL-T's equipment cooldowns apply to his equipment slots, not the equipment themselves. Thus, you can use the same equipment twice, bypassing its cooldown, provided you have both of MUL-T's equipment slots filled, and there is a third equipment nearby that you can use to move your equipment of choice from one slot to the other.
*With 1000%+ attack speed increase, the recoil of {{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailgun}} can knock the player back enough to keep them indefinitely in the air. This can also be achieved by carefully timing the final nail burst while wielding double {{Color|mul-t|Nailguns}} with {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}}.
*Use {{Color|mul-t|Blast Canister}} as a means of mass stunning to maximize the effectiveness of {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T's}} primaries.
*{{Color|mul-t|Transport Mode's}} armor also applies to fall damage. Use it before landing to greatly reduce the damage taken.
*Ramming into a larger enemy such as a {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}} while in {{Color|mul-t|Transport Mode}} will stun the enemy and instantly end the duration. Smaller enemies won't be stunned, but {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T}} can plow through them to deal damage to everything in an area.
*Due to the {{Color|mul-t|Rebar Puncher's}} high single shot damage, it synergizes very well with the {{ItemLink|Crowbar}}. A couple stacked up can allow the player to defeat even Stone Golems in a single shot for a good while, and take a good chunk out of any boss. If going for this build, it is important to remember to avoid purchasing offensive [[Interactibles#Drones|drones]], as they can damage enemies below the threshold for the Crowbar. Damage-over-time effects such as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} will also lower the effectiveness of Crowbars.
*It is possible to rapidly fire {{Color|mul-t|Rebar Puncher}} by equipping it to both the primary and miscellaneous loadout slots and constantly cycling weapons with {{Color|mul-t|Retool}}, effectively reducing the cooldown time between shots by 1.3 seconds. However, it is impossible to constantly hold both keybinds to do so anymore. Hold {{Color|mul-t|Rebar Puncher}}'s keybind, but only use {{Color|mul-t|Retool}} after each shot. Doing this will fire faster than holding down primary fire.
** When doing this, since the cooldown for the {{Color|mul-t|Rebar Puncher}} is bypassed, the attack will ''not'' scale with attack speed. However, this method will still remain faster than holding down the primary fire button until the player reaches 360% or more attack speed.
*{{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw}} can be used both while sprinting and when {{Color|mul-t|Transport Mode}} is active as long as the primary button is held down. This will also applies while the player is using the {{ItemLink|Volcanic Egg}}.
*{{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailgun}} will fire its final burst if canceled by entering {{Color|mul-t|Transport Mode}}, but it will not do this if cancelled by using {{Color|mul-t|Blast Canister}} or {{Color|mul-t|Retool}}.
*The {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}} increases the number of {{Color|mul-t|Blast Canisters}} held, making it essential when surrounded by a large group of enemies from either side.
**When leaving {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}}, all stacks of {{Color|mul-t|Blast Canisters}} are immediately recharged. If the player has a lot of Magazines, it is far quicker to quickly enter and exit {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}} than to wait for all the stacks to recharge naturally.
*The Backup Magazine affects {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T's}} secondary fire when in {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}}, although it only has a meaningful effect for {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}}. Even in this instance, the Scrap Launcher will only load in 4 shots per reload, meaning only the first barrage is improved under sustained fire.
*While {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher's}} knockback can make it difficult to use against aerial targets, the knockback can also be used to hit flying enemies downwards. Learning to aim and predict where the projectiles will go is key to using {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}} effectively.
*{{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw}} pulls {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T}} forwards when striking a target, allowing the player to cling to and strafe around larger enemies.
*{{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}} effectively doubles the player's damage output for little cost. Make use of this for great effect. One example is running 2 {{Color|mul-t|Power-Saws}}, which will turn its 1000% DPS and 10 procs per second into 2000% DPS and 20 procs per second.
** Running 2 {{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailguns}} helps make up for the low proc coefficient by triggering many on-hit effects from a distance. 
*The shot deviation of the primary weapon while {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}} is equipped determines the deviation of the miscellaneous weapon. For example, equipping the {{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw}} as the primary and {{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailgun}} as the miscellaneous will result in the {{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailgun}} having the same spread as the {{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw}}, or in other words, no spread at all. Equipping {{Color|mul-t|Rebar Puncher}} as the primary will also result in reduced spread, but the effect is not as noticeable as the {{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw's}}. Using the {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}} as the primary seems to have no effect on spread, and having the {{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailgun}} as the primary has no effect on spread. This mechanic can allow for more accurate bursts of {{Color|mul-t|Auto-Nailgun}} fire, or more controllable {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}} rockets. Consider this when choosing a loadout.
*The {{ItemLink|Essence of Heresy}} replaces {{Color|mul-t|Retool}}; this makes {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T's}} second primary attack and second equipment inaccessible, unless the player uses a [[Cleansing Pool]] or [[Shrine of Order]] to remove or transform the Essence of Heresy. Entering a new area automatically equips {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T's}} first primary attack, regardless of which primary was currently in use when first collecting the Essence.
*{{ItemLink|Purity}} affects the cooldown of the {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}}, reducing it to the minimum cooldown of 0.5 seconds, substantially increasing overall firepower. {{ItemLink|Alien Head}} also affects this, but the overall result is much less noticeable.
*A gummy clone of {{Color|mul-t|MUL-T}} created with {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}} ''cannot'' be corrupted by {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}}.

==Trivia ==
*MUL-T's "Janitor" skin is a reference to the [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]] Survivor, [[ror:HAN-D|HAN-D]].
* MUL-T has the highest base health of any selectable survivor.
*MUL-T starts the run in a crate instead of a drop pod. The crate breaks on impact with the terrain.
* During the release of the Anniversary Update, the {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}} briefly had a bug where it would activate its cooldown even while the player was firing it, making it have an effective cooldown of 0.5 seconds. This was quickly patched soon after its discovery.
*MUL-T's primary skills are all homages to various weapons from the ''Quake'' series of video games. The {{Color|mul-t| Auto-Nailgun}}, {{Color|mul-t|Rebar Puncher}}, {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}} and {{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw}} correspond to the Nailgun, Railgun, Rocket Launcher and Gauntlet respectively. The original grenade-launching form of the {{Color|mul-t|Scrap Launcher}} was similarly an homage to ''Quake''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Grenade Launcher.
*Alongside the {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} itself being a ''Doom'' reference, the name of the unlock challenge for the {{Color|mul-t|Power-Saw}} is also a ''Doom'' reference.
*The MUL-T you play as is the same MUL-T in the lore entry, it probably wasn’t caught before the Safe Travels reached its destination, from there it was most likely deployed but it went rogue and didn’t do its given mission.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by killing an {{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord}} with the {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}.

Completing it unlocks the {{SkillLink|Power-Saw|MUL-T}} in MUL-T's loadout.

== Tips ==
* Imp Overlords can be encountered as a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]] in {{EntityLink|entityName=Rallypoint Delta}} and {{EntityLink|entityName=Scorched Acres}} during Stage 3, or in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Abyssal Depths}} during Stage 4.
** They can also be encountered roaming these levels at high stages, or summoned via [[Shrine of Combat|Shrines of Combat]].

* The Preon Accumulator, when activated, takes a moment to fire its projectile, which moves quite slowly. Given the Overlord's ability to teleport, timing is key to avoid missing the shot and having to sit through the Accumulator's punishing 140 second cooldown. 
** Once spawned during a Teleporter Event, Imp Overlords will typically teleport immediately after spawning. Their destination is telegraphed by a reddish energy circle, which can help in lining up a shot.
** Picking up {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} in earlier stages saves a lot of trouble if the first shot either misses or is not lethal.

* If the Preon Accumulator is unlocked from completing the [[REDACTED]] challenge, it can be selected via the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}.

* Using the Accumulator found in the timed chest in Rallypoint Delta is not required, although recommended if not using Command.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by defeating two {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen|Beetle Queens}} without leaving the [[Teleporter]] zone as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}.

Completing the challenge unlocks MUL-T's {{SkillLink|Scrap Launcher|MUL-T}} skill.

== Tips ==
* Beetle Queens are common bosses for both Stage 1 and Stage 2.
** Enabling the{{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} doubles the amount of bosses and halves their individual health, making them easily manageable even with few items.
** [[Shrine of the Mountain|Shrines of the Mountain]] also increase the amount of bosses, but may be more difficult.
* The main difficulty in completing this challenge is that Beetle Queens are large and obstructive, and summon many {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards}} that may further obstruct the Teleporter radius, especially when the Teleporter is on uneven ground. Be mindful not to accidentally step outside of the circle.
** The Beetle Guards' attacks also inflict moderate knockback, so they may hit MUL-T out of the Teleporter radius. Items that combat MUL-T's poor mobility are a great help.
**Additionally, Beetle Queens are considerably more dangerous in close quarters, as their only direct attack is a shotgun-like spray of acid. Staying close to the Beetle Queens is necessary to complete the challenge, but the player must exercise extreme caution to stay alive.
* Avoid using {{SkillLink|skillName=Transport Mode|survivorName=}} while attempting this challenge.
*If MUL-T's {{SkillLink|skillName=Power-Saw|survivorName=MUL-T}} is unlocked, it can help complete this challenge more easily thanks to its high damage and proc rate. 
**If {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}} is unlocked as well, this strategy deals twice as much damage and gives MUL-T extra armor to withstand close-range Beetle Queen attacks. However, it reduces MUL-T's mobility, meaning the player may have difficulty recovering from knockback and may be inadvertently knocked out of the Teleporter radius.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} by successfully clearing the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}} on stage 7 or later.

== Tips ==
* ''See the [[Void Fields#Tips|Void Fields]] page for some general strategy.''
* The player should not enter the Null Portal until the {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time}} has reached at least Stage 7.
** The quickest method is to take a Blue Portal on Stage 6, in which the succeeding Bazaar and Void Fields will be Stage 7.

'''Macho''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by dealing 5000 [[damage]] in one shot.

==Tip==
* Gathering many {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} to use with [[Survivors]] that have single, strong hits, such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}}, makes quick work of this challenge.
*Using the slamming attack of  {{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}} is a great way to complete this challenge early in a run.
* Activating the  {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}} is a great way to complete this challenge, since it multiplies the damage of the activating hit by 500%.
* The {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} easily completes this challenge, with every character having a starting base damage of 11 and higher.
* Triggering the {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} or Charged Perforator using the H3AD-5T v2, {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}, {{ItemLink|Ceremonial Dagger}}, {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} or {{ItemLink|Little Disciple}} will deal a huge amount of damage.
* Getting below 25% HP while holding a {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}} and hitting any enemy with the resulting supernova will instantly complete this challenge.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Magma Worm|returning]] [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] in Risk of Rain 2. Being a Boss, the Magma Worm may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

The Magma Worm has a stronger variant, the {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}. The Overloading Worm is ''not'' considered an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] Magma Worm, but rather a unique Monster.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Magma Worms do not attack players in the same vein as other bosses; their primary form of attack is to {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire|altText=burn}} targets that it makes contact with. Each time a Magma Worm emerges from the ground, the screen changes color to a bright orange to signify the heat. All of the Magma Worm's skills are related to modifying its movement patterns. Direct impact with the Magma Worm's head deals 300% with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

The Worm's movement can be thought of as that of a pendulum with a reference to the ground, where the Worm emerges and submerges, but also circles around a point.

=== Primary: Steer At Target ===
This causes the Magma Worm to override its spring-like movement and adjust its movement direction towards the target. This skill has a cooldown of 1 second and lasts practically for one frame, serving as a correction for its target position.

=== Utility: Blink ===
This is like the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Imp Overlord|altText=Imp Overlord's Blink|altUrl=Imp Overlord#Utility: Blink}} skill, except that the Magma Worm does not disappear for the duration, nor create a blast when it arrives at its destination. This purpose of this skill seems to be to allow the Worm to become unstuck from entering and exiting terrain that is far away from the target without an easy way to close the distance. For example, the Magma Worm being at the top of the high area on {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} and the player being on the platform where [[Sky Meadow#Newt Altars|Newt Altar #4]] is located. This move is characterised by the Worm heading towards the player in a straight line without the need to burrow or unburrow frequently.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.

=== Special: Change Stance ===
The Magma Worm is by default in the '''grounded stance''' which is characterised by a "stiff" spring constant and makes the Worm stay close to the ground and burrow/unburrow quickly. When this skill is activated, the Worm will change to the '''leaping stance''' for 14 seconds, which is characterised by a "looser" spring constant and makes the Worm reach higher before burrowing again. This skill can be combined with its primary, which makes the Worm attempt to dive into the ground close to where its target is. During this stance, 5 molten fireballs will erupt from the Worm's body whenever it crosses any terrain boundary with a minimum of 0.1 seconds delay before the effect can be triggered again. The fireballs deal 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 7m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|linear]] falloff.

{{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can block the molten fireballs.

This skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds which does not start until the Worm has returned to the grounded state.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special''': the Worm must be within 80m from its target.
# '''Use utility''': the Worm must be within 20-300m from its target.
# '''Use primary''': the Worm must be within 300m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Molten Perforator]]''

If the Magma Worm is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Magma Worm) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}}.

== Tips ==
* It is advisable to fight Magma Worms in wide open spaces, as fighting them in cramped spaces can be troublesome. For example, in [[Rallypoint Delta|Rallypoint Delta's]] caves, when the Worm leaps, players not only cannot efficiently damage it (as it continuously disappears into the rock above), but they cannot see where the it is about to land as it burrows back into the ground. In a situation where a Magma Worm is spawned from a Teleporter placed in an unfortunate position, it may be a good idea to lead the Worm to a more suitable fighting area before returning to the Teleporter area.
* Marking the Magma Worm (middle mouse button by default) can help keep track of it when it travels inside terrain.
* Because of how much ground they traverse compared to other enemies, it is possible that Magma Worms may change targets mid-attack if a new potential victim comes into range. This might be another player, or even an unlucky turret.

*** Grounded: Snakes low but fast around on the ground.
*** ''*The intent is to give a break from the Worm's constant leaping and to give short range characters a chance to attack. The Worm should also be an intense fight, not a slog.*''
** '''[Community Suggestion]''' Reduced armor from 20 to 15 to make it less tanky.
** '''[Community Suggestion]''' Can now jump off of platforms so it doesn't get stuck on certain ledges.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a special [[Monsters|monster]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''.

This monster cannot spawn normally, but whenever a [[Malachite Elites|Malachite Elite]] is killed, this monster spawns where the Elite died.

The Malachite's Urchin's health decays, automatically dying in 20 seconds if no additional damage is dealt.

== Notes ==
* Despite the name, this monster is ''not'' treated as a Malachite Elite; it does not apply the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HealingDisabled}} debuff or create Malachite spike pits, nor will it interact with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Old Guillotine}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Wake of Vultures}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Brainstalks}}.
* Malachite Urchins spawn with 100 armor, the most starting armor of any enemy (not including the {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}).

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Malachite Minigun ===
The Malachite Urchin brings its spikes forward for 0.5 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and then fires a continous stream of homing needles every 0.25s moving at 50m/s, each dealing 25% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. The critical strike chance is rolled once per second for all the shots in its duration. Upon ending the skill, there is a 0.1s end lag which scales with attack speed.

This skill has a cooldown of 2 seconds. Since the firing can be continuous, the skill can come off cooldown again which makes the minimum delay between activations 0.6 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Urchin must be within 60m from its target and have line of sight. The behavior is active for 3 seconds, so it can keep firing even if the target has moved further away.
# '''Search for target''': no requirements.

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[PS4 &amp; Xbox One Patch]]
* Bug Fixes
** Solved an issue where the Malachite Urchin enemies would remain visible after defeating them.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Medkit|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder takes damage, they get the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MedkitHeal}} buff for 2 seconds. When the buff expires, the holder recovers 20 HP, plus an additional 5% ''(+5% per stack)'' of their maximum health. 

== Notes ==

* If the player takes damage again while they have the Medkit Heal buff, the buff's duration will be reset and they will have to avoid damage for another 2 seconds to receive healing. This makes the item ineffective for recovering from most damage-over-time effects or rapidly-firing attacks.
* As {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MedkitHeal}} is a buff, it can not be cleared to activate its effects early by using {{ItemLink|itemName=Blast Shower}}.

==Tips==

* At 20+ stacks, receiving Medkit healing will fully recover the player's health. The number required to do this is reduced by having any {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack|altText=Rejuvenation Racks}}; having one Rack requires half as many Medkits (10), having two Racks requires a third as many (7), so on and so forth.
* If the player intentionally takes damage less than the amount they would recover, such as slight fall damage or suffocation from the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, the Medkit can be used to gain net positive health, albeit slowly.
* {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} can afford the player more opportunities to heal, as it can block damage that would otherwise reset the Medkit's charge time.
* Obtaining the {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} affords the player enough time to receive the Medkit's healing, in addition to the extra healing that comes from {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}}. This comes at the cost of that [[Survivors|Survivor's]] utility skill.

==Trivia==
*The soldier in the logbook entry might be an Enforcer, which is a playable character in Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain Returns. This is suggested by their blue combat helmet, shotgun, and their statement, "And everyone else is recovering from last night's attacks. Without the enforcers, we probably wouldn't have-"

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.

A highly mobile and maneuverable fighter, the Mercenary strikes swiftly and rapidly to devastate enemies, gaining both invincibility and mobility with his various attacks. Due to his skills' low cooldowns (which are further reduced by his signature {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MercExpose}} debuff), his playstyle focuses on repeatedly chaining together attacks to stay on the offensive in any situation.

Completing the [[True Respite]] challenge will unlock Mercenary as a playable survivor.

* Any bonus {{Color|u|attack speed}} will decrease the time spent in the recovery animation, but it cannot be fully removed. 
* When using another skill during the third swing's animation, the recovery animation is canceled. This also causes the third swing's hitbox to remain active while using that other skill, staying front of Mercenary as the skill moves him.

* The player has 2.66 (depending on fps) seconds to use this ability again after striking an enemy (while a charge is available).
* Grants invulnerability for ~0.3 seconds and a lingering ~0.3 seconds at the end of each dash, for a total of 0.6 per dash and a total of 1.8 seconds of invulnerability for all dashes combined.

}}

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use special''': Mercenary must be within 20m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. The behavior is active for 1 second and cannot be selected twice in a row. Since the behavior is not explicit about which version of the skill is to be used, this means that even Slicing Winds requires Mercenary to get in close range, even though for an intelligent agent the skill could be useful from further away.
# '''Use secondary''': Mercenary has to be within 8m from the target.
# '''Use primary''': Mercenary has to be within 6m from the target.
# '''Use utility''': Mercenary has to be within 5-30m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. Since this behavior is implicit for all skills that can occupy the utility slot, {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}} is used in the same way, i.e., within proxity of the target and to get even closer, not to get away to safety while low on health or surrounded by dangerous enemies.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Techs ==
* When using another skill during the animation for {{Color|mercenary|Laser Sword's}} third hit, its hitbox remains active during that other skill, even if {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} moves. This is commonly referred to as an "M1 extension," and it enables fast combos and negates the endlag of the third strike.
** This is most valuable when combined with {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary's}} utility skills, allowing the player to {{Color|mercenary|Expose}} a long line of enemies or deal great burst damage to them. It can also be used with {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} to deal more damage to the targeted enemy.
* {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} can be used on slanted edges or ramps to launch {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} vertically, gaining a large amount of height for looking around, reaching high areas, or using the {{ItemLink|itemName=H3AD-5T v2}}.
* If {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} ends {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assault}} or {{Color|mercenary|Focused Assault}} inside of a flying enemy's hitbox, it will be pushed away at high speed and take colossal damage when colliding with stage geometry. This is extremely effective for dealing with flying bosses such as the {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}} and {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, often killing them instantly.
** Small enemies can be shoved and slammed in a similar manner using {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}}, which knocks the enemy upwards. However, this force is not enough to move medium or large enemies.
* {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assault}} can be canceled mid-dash by using either {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} or {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}}, shortening the length of the dash. This is useful primarily to avoid overshooting or in order to precisely end a dash for, say, a slam (the tip above).
* {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}} can apply a second {{Color|mercenary|Expose}} stack when triggered by a skill that inflicts {{Color|mercenary|Expose}}, and is currently the only method for doing so. It can also {{Color|mercenary|Expose}} other enemies caught in its explosion, although this usually is not quite as relevant without stacking multiple Behemoths, as the explosion radius is somewhat small.
* The animation of {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} can be cancelled by using {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}}, {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}}, {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assault}}, or {{Color|mercenary|Focused Assault}}.

== Tips ==
* Strafe around enemies and try to stay behind them at all times. Few enemies can attack behind themselves, and most of them cannot keep up with the player constantly strafing.
* Prioritize enemies that are immediate threats, but also remember to flee if things get dicey. Do not constantly rely on {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary's}} invincibility frames to completely negate damage; stay dodgy and avoid being hit altogether when possible.
* Although {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} is smoother and easier to combo with than {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}}, {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}} itself has higher damage output (550% compared to {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}}'s 400%) and can be more adaptive with dodges due to its quick vertical movement.
* Notably, only {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} benefits from hitting an {{Color|mercenary|Exposed}} enemy. If a non-{{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} character or ally hits an {{Color|mercenary|Exposed}} enemy, the {{Color|mercenary|Exposed}} is not removed and the ally does not deal more damage or get cooldown reduction.
* When fighting bosses, {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} can stay safely in the air above their heads for a very long time by chaining together {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}}→{{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}}→{{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} along with {{Color|mercenary|Laser Sword}} attacks and double jumps. {{Color|mercenary|Laser Sword}} also has a slight vacuum effect and can be used to stick to and strafe around larger enemies.
* {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} actually receives downsides from having bonus attack speed, narrowing the window to perform {{Color|mercenary|Laser Sword}} extensions and shortening the distance that {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} and {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}} move him. Attack speed can still be useful as it shortens the cast time of his skills and gives additional {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} hits, but these losses should be taken into consideration as well.
* Both {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} and {{Color|mercenary|Rising Thunder}} have short enough cooldowns that a single {{ItemLink|Purity}} will allow them to be used continuously, allowing them to be used as a re-usable dash or to ascend upwards indefinitely. Note that without a {{ItemLink|itemName=57 Leaf Clover}} this will lower overall proc chances.
* {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assault's}} cooldown reset leaves just enough time to use {{Color|mercenary|Laser Sword}} twice or combo {{Color|mercenary|Whirlwind}} + {{Color|mercenary|Laser Sword}} before needing to dash again. There is also just enough time to use {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} or {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} between {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assaults}}, if used immediately without any delay between dashes.
* Well timed uses of {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assault}} can enable the player to maintain invulnerability with only their utility. This can also be achieved with Focused Assault, albeit this skill requires more finesse for the same results.
* Some bosses have heads which act as solid platforms, which the {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} can stand on to fight the boss without as much danger from enemies below.
* {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} is a very effective single-target and area-of-effect tool for Mercenary, as it has a higher general damage output than {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}}, as well as inflicting {{Color|mercenary|Expose}} at the end of the skill. {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} deals 1150% (800% + 350% from {{Color|mercenary|Expose}}) damage on a single target and up to 3450% total damage against 3 targets (1150%x3 targets, as it can {{Color|mercenary|Expose}} those 3 targets). By comparison, {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} deals 770% total damage to a single target, and does not properly hit multiple targets. 
** Although {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} deals more damage with higher attack speed, it needs around ~30 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|alt=Soldier's Syringes}} to match {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}}.
* {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} prevents the player from using other skills during its duration, while {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} does not. This means that the player can attack and use other skills while {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} is active, and with a {{ItemLink|Brainstalks}} or other method of reducing cooldowns (such as a {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} or getting enough cooldown reduction that the cooldown finishes before the skill ends), it's possible to chain multiple uses of {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}}.
* Although {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} is a ranged attack, its projectile is a bit slow, so it's most effectively used at melee or close range. Make use of its wide hitbox to strike many enemies.
* {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} is one of 2 Survivors with a 1.0 proc coefficient on every single skill, making {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} fairly decent at procs in any regard.
* {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} can be a difficult character to master next to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}}, and thus requires patience and practice. Learn to chain his abilities and follow up your attacks on exposed enemies to reduce your skill cooldowns.
* {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} can easily exploit most enemies with enough stacks of {{ItemLink|Purity}} to knock the cooldown {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} down to one second, allowing him to effectively spam {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} until an enemy dies due to a full {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} lasting more than one second
** With enough stacks of {{ItemLink|Purity}}, {{Color|mercenary|Mercenary}} can also basically fly by getting enough {{ItemLink|Purity}} to get his cooldowns to where he can fly by spamming and alternating between {{Color|mercenary|Eviscerate}} and either {{Color|mercenary|Blinding Assault}} or {{Color|mercenary|Focused Assault}}.

== Trivia ==
* Mercenary was one of the playable characters in the first Risk of Rain.
* Prior to the Anniversary Update, Mercenary's ending phrase was {{Color|#959494|"..and so he left, with terrible power in shaking hands."}}
** Unlike other epilogues revised in the Anniversary Update, Mercenary's original epilogue was not a reiteration of his epilogue from the first [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]], which was instead {{Color|#959494|"..and so he left, never to become human again."}}
* The Prisoner skin of the Mercenary is a reference to "The Beheaded" from the game Dead Cells.
* Prior to Build ID #3731106, Eviscerating directly into the ground when airborne would inflict heavy fall damage.
* Prior to the 1.0 Update, Expose did not exist for Mercenary, and as such {{Color|mercenary|Slicing Winds}} would not inflict Expose at the end of its duration. This meant its single-target total damage was 800% and multi-target total damage was 2400%.
* Mercenary is probably a bounty hunter hired by the [[Captain]] to help out in case of danger on the rescue mission.
*Mercenary is left-handed.
*Mercenary currently has more skins than any other survivor, due to being the only one getting an extra skin with the [[Devotion Update]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} by not touching the ground for 30 seconds.

==Tips==
* Jumping from a high enough point and using {{SkillLink|Whirlwind|Mercenary}}, {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}} and {{SkillLink|Eviscerate|Mercenary}} as soon as they become available can be enough to complete this challenge.
* Items like {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather|altText=Hopoo Feathers}}, {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}, and {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} can help the player stay in the air longer.
*Floating in the air currents on {{entityLink|Sky Meadow}} easily completes the challenge.
*Standing on a monster, even a {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}}, counts as touching the ground and will reset the timer.
*Having a {{ItemLink|Purity}} reduces the cooldown of Whirlwind to 0.5 seconds, allowing the player to repeatedly use it and stay in the air.</text>

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} by completing a [[Prismatic Trial]] without falling below 100% [[health]].

Losing any health or [[Health#Shield|shield]] invalidates the challenge. Losing [[Health#Barrier|barriers]] (for example, from {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}}) does ''not'' invalidate it.

==Tips==
* Try to destroy time crystals by reducing their health enough for {{SkillLink|Eviscerate|Mercenary}} or {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault|Mercenary}} to destroy them, so that no damage is incurred from the resulting explosion.
* Drones and turrets can serve as distractions for enemies, allowing one to use Blinding Assault or Eviscerate to either finish off or soften enemies without risking being hit.
* All [[interactables]] spawn in the exact same location when restarting the Trial, making it useful for finding drones and turrets to help distract and kill enemies.
* Items in chests are static in the trial, meaning the spawned item from a certain chest or [[Lunar Pod]] will never change when retrying a trial. This is useful for finding items that increase the player's damage ({{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, etc.) or add effects that help them flee ({{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}, {{ItemLink|Energy Drink}}, etc.) without having to worry about the item being different.
* Ranged attacks are especially useful. Items like a {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}} or a {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} can improve the chances of success. However, this is limited by the generated seed that keeps item spawns static.
* Shaped Glass does not invalidate the challenge as it is not technically falling below 100% health. Rather, the 100% health value is reduced. The double damage can prove extremely useful; taking any damage fails the challenge anyway, so there are no downsides to doing this other than the [[Lunar Coins|lunar coin]] cost per attempt.
* Runs will have random artifacts active for the generated seed. {{ArtifactLink|Command}} and/or {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} are recommended for doing Ethereal due to controlled selection of items and the 500% damage increase, respectively.
* Obtaining the {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}} allows the player to engage enemies at long range with relative safety. However, without an extremely lucky Lunar Pod, this option is not available until reaching the {{EntityLink|entityName=Bazaar Between Time}} and cannot be used on the first stage in the Prismatic Trial.
** Obtaining a {{ItemLink|Purity}} makes this strategy even more effective, at the cost of chance effects.
* The {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} cost Mercenary a crowd-control attack, but afford him a powerful retreat option that gives total invulnerability.
*In Prismatic Trials, going through [[Bulwark's Ambry|Bulwark's Ambry's]] portal causes the trial to end, granting the player victory and the achievement. If [[Sky Meadow]] is the second stage in trial, this is an easy way to skip a stage.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} is especially useful for this challenge to make short work of the Teleporter Boss.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled, Void Seeds will spawn ''caches'' rather than ''cradles''. This can allow one to obtain the very useful {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}} without having to sacrifice half their health to do so.
**This can be very difficult to pull off in practice, however, as any {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Barnacle}}s can be tricky to clear without taking damage from the fog.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} by using 20 abilities in 10 seconds.

== Tips ==
* This can be achieved without a single item and when using the default loadout. While fighting a tightly-packed group of enemies, repeatedly using {{SkillLink|skillName=Laser Sword|survivorName=Mercenary}} to {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MercExpose}} as many enemies as possible can recharge {{SkillLink|skillName=Blinding Assault|survivorName=}} quickly enough to reach the number of attacks required.
* With 4 or more{{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|altText=Soldier's Syringes}}, Mercenary's primary attack speed becomes fast enough to complete the challenge. 
** This is also possible when equipped with {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}, since each individual shot counts as one ability and they stack up to 12.
* {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|altText=Backup Magazines}} and {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner|altText=Hardlight Afterburners}} allow stacking uses of secondary and utility attacks. Having enough makes this challenge trivial.
* {{ItemLink|Brainstalks}} allow the player to repeatedly use abilities for a short time after slaying an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]].
* It is also possible to complete the challenge between runs by continuously restarting runs after spamming many abilities, since the challenge only counts in-game time and does not reset the counter after each run.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in ''[[Early Access Content Update 5|Content Update 5]]''.

The item places a ward in a random location within 50m the holder that gives the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PowerBuff}} status to any character within 16m (''+50% per stack''), increasing their damage by 50%. The character is powered up regardless of whether they are an ally or enemy. The ward lasts for 24 seconds and will take another second to replace itself near the holder.  

== Notes ==
* If there is no suitable place for a ward to appear within 50m, nothing will happen, but as soon as a spawning position is found, a ward will appear there.
*The radius is determined by this formula &lt;code&gt;16 &amp;sdot; 1.5 ^ (X - 1)&lt;/code&gt; where X is the number of stacks you have. Once you have 4 stacks, the radius will be 54m which is large enough to always contain the player's position when it spawns, no matter how far away it spawns
* The Power Buff status only persists as long as the character stays in the ward's radius. It expires almost immediately when the character leaves the radius, or if the ward expires.
* The ward has a radius indicating its area of effect, similar to the {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}}, but its actual area of effect is slightly smaller than the indicator.
* While the ward's placement is somewhat random, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} can utilize this item very well if his {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|survivorName=Engineer|altText=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} are in the ward's radius.
** Engineer's turrets will also place nearby wards.
* Be aware of how large the ward's radius becomes when stacking this item. While increasing the radius gives the player more freedom to move around within, excessive stacks will make it much more likely for enemies to become powered up as well.
** Unlike {{ItemLink|itemName=Warbanner}}, the Radius increases by 50% of the previous stacks radius, making each stack increase the radius further than the last.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, the player gets the ability to fly for 15 seconds. 

The direction of flight is directly dependent on where the Chrysalis is displayed on the body and jumping allows the player to dash in the direction of movement with no cooldown. Moving vertically is relative to the direction they are facing while moving forwards or backwards. Once the buff expires, the player will float back to the ground if they were in the air. 

== Notes ==
* There is a strange bug regarding this item being used with {{ItemLink|Bottled Chaos}}. If you have enough stacks of Bottled Chaos to trigger the Milky Chrysalis effect twice in one activation, then until you either respawn by using an item like {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} or go to the next stage, you will be unable to fly while this equipment is active. Jumping will still give you a dash in the direction you are moving, but you will no longer hover in the air or be able to move vertically. Even if all Bottled Chaoses are lost during the stage, the flight effect will not be regained.
* While floating back down to the ground after the buff expires, you will be completely unable to move downwards any faster than normal. For survivors like {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} and {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} with many mobility skills this can cause some strange movement when trying to use those skills to go down.
** This can be quite a dangerous position to be in, as without sufficient movement speed, not much can be done to avoid attacks from enemies such as {{MonsterLink|Clay Templar|Clay Templars}} and {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|Lunar Chimeras (Wisp)}} when slowly floating down.

== Tips ==
* Using the Chrysalis, the player can skip the pillar charging sequence on [[Commencement]] and fly straight to the arena.
** If the player does not have enough movement speed items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Paul's Goat Hoof}}, or enough equipment cooldown items like the {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell}}, they will need to rest on one of the support beams below the arena.

* This equipment can assist low-mobility survivors like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}}, which can open up previously unreachable areas that were hard or impossible to reach naturally.

}}

== Trivia ==
* Due to the direction of flight being dependent on the position of the wings on the character, using characters that do not have display rules defined prevents the Chrysalis from being used entirely. This is mostly encountered when using Survivor [[Modding|Mods]].

* Sometimes, if the player activates a Milky Chrysalis while the {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} is active (obtained via {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} or an [[Chests#Equipment Barrel|Equipment Barrel]], as Milky Chrysalis cannot be obtained from the Artifact of Enigma), it will grant infinite flight for the rest of the stage. This behavior may be patched in the future updates.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Mushrum|returning]] mushroom [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''Artifacts'' Update.

==Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
A Mini Mushrum generally wanders around aimlessly. Upon death, its body can be seen going back into the ground while its cap still remains above ground.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Mini Mushrum's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Fiery Spore Bomb ===
The Mini Mushrum prepares a spore bomb, visible above its head, for 2.6 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), and then lobs it towards the target. The bomb can be thrown within a 5-60m distance and it takes 1.5 seconds to land. Upon contact it explodes dealing 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.5 in a radius of 5m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear]] falloff. It also leaves a blazing circular area behind that deals 40% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.25 per tick in a 6m radius. It ticks 5 times per second for 7 seconds. Getting hit by this also applies {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50|altText=a slow}} effect on the target. 

The attack lasts for 4.4 seconds, which scales with attack speed. However, for sufficiently high enough values of attack speed charging, firing, and ending the attack can occur on the same frame. 

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.

=== Utility: Regenerative Ingrain ===
The Mini Mushrum plants itself firmly into the ground over 1 second (scales with attack speed), creating a healing circle around itself that has the exact same healing effect as 3 {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus|Bustling Fungi}}. It heals for 2.25% health every 0.25 seconds in a radius of 6.5m, including any other monsters that happen to enter the area. The healing duration lasts for a maximum of 15 seconds, but the Mushrum can end it earlier by issuing a moving command after 7 seconds. Both of these values scale with attack speed, which means the higher the attack speed, the less effective health can be regained. 

When the Mushrum unburrows, it does so over 0.8 seconds, which scales with attack speed. 

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds but this is irrelevant as the minimum skill duration is longer than this.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Mushrum must be within 60m from its target, have line of sight, and have at least 50% health.
# '''Flee sprinting''': the Mushrum must be within 60m from its target and have less than 50% health. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use utility''': the Mushrum must have less than 50% health. This behavior will be active for 4 seconds. As a result, when the player gets the Mushrum to less than 50% health, it will run away 3 seconds and then heal. If the Mushrum is still below 50% health after it has finished with this move, it will attempt to flee and heal again.
# '''Chase''': the Mushrum must be at least 30m away from its target.
# '''Strafe''': the Mushrum must be within 30m from its target.

== Tips ==
* Players should always keep moving and scan their surroundings constantly when dealing with Mini Mushrums, since they can throw their Spore Bombs from a considerable distance. This can prove fatal if caught off-guard, especially from [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]].
* The slowness inflicted by the fire field stacks with {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80|altText=slowness}} inflicted by [[Monsters#Glacial|Glacial]] Elites, making these Mushrums especially dangerous. Setting foot in the fiery area from these Elites, even if for a moment, will drastically reduce the player's movement speed and make escaping the continuous damage much more difficult.
* Leaving a Mini Mushrum in a partially damaged state can be dangerous. Letting one heal can waste precious time, not to mention it can potentially heal other monsters as well.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}&lt;br /&gt;
==Trivia==

* The Mini Mushrum was simply named "[[ror:Mushrum|Mushrum]]" in Risk of Rain 1, which suggests that a larger monster related to it was a planned addition.
* The blazing pool's area of effect is not actually a circle, but two overlapping squares with one rotated 45 degrees around its center point, effectively forming a concave hexadecagon. In some points the "spikes" of the shape extend just a bit outside of the zone's circular indicator. Similarly, the "dips" mean that the player can enter the zone without taking damage in specific points.
** While the pool's visual effect will adapt to the surface's geometry, the hitboxes do not "curve" along with it. As such, if the spore lands on the edge of a cliff, the player can take damage even where there is no ground. In a ramp the hitboxes will try to align themselves to the terrain's angle, while on walls the visual will be vertical and the hitbox horizontal.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Clay Dunestrider}}. 

Whenever enemies are within 13m of the holder, a tendril of tar will reach out from them to an enemy. This tendril inflicts the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} debuff, reducing the enemy's [[Movement Speed|movement speed]], while continuously damaging it for 25% damage every 0.25 seconds with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.0 while healing the holder for the damage dealt. 

The maximum number of tendrils that can be active at once is equal to the number of held Mired Urns.

== Notes ==

* It is not necessary to hit an enemy to activate this effect, but the player must be '''in combat'''. Read the notes for {{ItemLink|itemName=Red Whip}} to see which skills preserve the out-of-combat property.
* The Mired Urn's {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ClayGoo}} debuff counts toward the {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}}.
*Even though The Urn has a proc coefficient of 0.0, it can [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically strike]]. However, the aforementioned property prevents it from activating on-crit items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Predatory Instincts}}.
*If the damage is blocked by {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}, or because the target is {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Immune}}, the holder will not receive any healing.

== Tips==
*Melee [[Survivors]] who stay close to the action will make the most effective use of the Mired Urn, such as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, and {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}.
**{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} also excels with this item, allowing his turrets to constantly drain health from enemies, increasing both their damage and survivability.

*Pair the Mired Urn with the {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}} to increase the damage dealt and health restored.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Interactibles#Drones|Drone]] that can support the player with extra [[damage]]. 

Once purchased, the Missile Drone follows the player's [[Survivors|survivor]] at a close distance and shoots missiles at targets. It is possible to bind more than one Missile Drone to the survivor.

== Skill &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Missiles ===
The Missile Drone fires 4 missiles with a delay of 0.1 seconds between shots, dealing 4 * 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. These do not explode; only a direct hit will deal full damage.

This skill has a cooldown of 1.5 seconds, beginning on activation.

=== Behaviors ===
The Missile Drone exhibits the same behaviors as the {{EntityLink|entityName=Gunner Drone|altUrl=Gunner Drone#Behaviors}}, except that it does not have the last behavior, which is to chase down enemies while the owner is dead. As such it may revert to its [[Enemy AI#Wander|Wander]]/[[Enemy AI#Look Busy|Look Busy]] state if there are no enemies around it.

{{MonsterPage|Mithrix (Phase 4)}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the final [[Monsters#Special Bosses|boss]] of Risk of Rain 2. He is encountered at the apex of {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}, the moon of {{EntityLink|Petrichor V}} and final stage of the game.

==Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Description ==
Mithrix is an ancient, cyclopian humanoid with godlike powers, much of which he shared with his brother [[ror:Providence|Providence]]. The growing philosophical opposition between the two siblings worsened to the point that Mithrix was banished to the shattered pieces of {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}, while Providence took to carrying out his own vision on the world below.

By the time of the events of Risk of Rain 2, Providence had been slain, yet Mithrix's confinement upon Commencement as the '''King of Nothing''' continued. It would be the [[Survivors]] of the [[UES Safe Travels]] who reached the moon via the [https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Teleporter#Primordial_Teleporter Primordial Teleporter] to put an apparent end to him.

The deeper details and circumstances of Mithrix and Providence's relationship are detailed throughout many of the game's [[Lore|logs]], most of which are taken from Mithrix's perspective, including those for {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}} and more. 

==Skills &amp; Encounter==
During phases 1 and 3 of the fight, Mithrix has the [[Armor#Adaptive Armor|adaptive armor]] passive and [[Difficulty#Unique scaling|unique scaling]]. These two aspects make him extremely tanky compared to other enemies due to increased health and armor boost.

==Boss Encounter==
===Phase 1 ===
Mithrix starts the battle with basic attacks, running towards the player to get into melee range.

====Primary: Hammer Smash/Needle Barrage====
This skill has two modes depending on whether Mithrix is running or not.

If Mithrix is not running, he can use Hammer Smash, where he stops and winds up to smash the ground with his hammer. A direct hit from the hammer's path deals 1200% with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. As the hammer hits the ground, it creates an explosion also dealing 1200% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 12m with [[Damage#Damage Fallof|linear falloff]]. The combination of both sources of damage can kill the player though [https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Damage#One-Shot_Protection one-shot protection] if the first hit doesn't trigger OSP, but if the first does trigger OSP, the blast will not damage the player as it occurs in less than 0.1s from when OSP has been triggered.

The attack lasts for 4 seconds, during which Mithrix is open to attacks. However, attack speed affects the animation of the wind up and how quickly the smash will occur from the moment the skill is activated.

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds.

If Mithrix is sprinting instead, he can fire up to 12 homing needles moving at 120m/s that last 3 seconds. Each needle explodes upon impact or when despawning dealing 60% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 2m with no falloff.

This skill has a cooldown of 6 seconds, which begins after the first needle is fired. Once the skill has come off cooldown, it will replenish all 12 stocks regardless of how many have been used.

If Mithrix toggles sprinting while the skill is on cooldown so that it switches to Hammer Smash and back, all charges will be replenished immediately.

====Secondary: Hammer Swing====
Mithrix swipes with his hammer, dealing 200% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 while pushing the target away. This attack moves him forwards a moderate amount.

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds and the attack animation lasts for 4 seconds which scales with attack speed.

====Utility: Dash====
Mithrix dashes a short distance forward, backward, left, or right for 0.3 seconds. This also removes all his timed [[Status Effects#Debuffs|debuffs]], but not any [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage-over-time]] effects.

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds and holds 2 charges.

====Special: Shock Wave====
Mithrix bends down to jump high into the air, which he does after 1 second (scales with attack speed). After 3 seconds he slams down in the center of the arena, creating a ring-shaped shockwave consisting of 12 waves that travel outwards at 60m/s for 3 seconds. The shock wave effectively ends when it reaches the thin line of rocks between the platform where he is first seen. Each wave deals 400% with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}}.

These waves can be blocked by {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

Mithrix gains {{StatusEffectLink|ArmorBoost}} while jumping and landing, and {{StatusEffectLink|HiddenInvincibility}} while in the air. If Mithrix is frozen by {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner|altText=Railgunner's}} skills while preparing to jump, the jump will be cancelled.

This skill has a cooldown of 30 seconds.

====Behaviors====
#'''Use special (Shock Wave)''': Mithrix must have less than 75% health.
#'''Use utility and strafe''': Mithrix must be within 40m from its target, This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row. If this behavior is selected as Mithrix is approaching the player, it will very likely be followed up by either his primary or secondary skill. This can look like strafing out of the way of a possible incoming attack and then attacking from the flank.
#'''Use utility''': Mithrix must be within 40-50m from its target. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use secondary''': Mithrix must be within 40m from its target.
#'''Use primary (Hammer Smash)''': Mithrix must be within 35m from its target.
#'''Sprint and use primary (Needle Barrage)''': Mithrix must be more than 70m away from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 80% health. Mithrix will ignore the node graph and run directly towards the target. This behavior is active for 2 seconds.
#'''Chase off nodegraph''': Mithix must be within 50m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and will most likely be selected when Mithrix is near the target after both the primary and secondary are on cooldown.
#'''Sprint off nodegraph''': Mithrix must be more than 50m away from its target. This behavior is active for 1 second.
#'''Chase''': no requirements.

===Phase 2===
Mithrix leaves the arena, and several stone pillars rise up around the arena. In place of Mithrix himself, 2 {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)|Lunar Chimera Golems}} and 4{{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|Lunar Chimera Wisps}} initially spawn around the arena with more {{MonsterFamily|familyName=Lunar}} enemies spawning by a [[Directors#Continuous|Combat Director]] as time goes on. All spawned enemies must be defeated to complete this phase.

===Phase 3===
Mithrix returns with his hammer glowing blue and some of his attacks are now upgraded. Lunar enemies will also continue spawning occasionally. 

====Primary: Lunar Hammer Smash/Needle Barrage ====
Mithrix's Hammer Smash is now energized and upon explosion it will create two additional effects. 3 small shock waves are sent forward, similar to those from his Shock Wave skill. These deal 200% with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and also inflict Cripple.

A lingering pillar of blue flame is also created at the hammer's point of impact, which deals 75% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2 and ticks 6 times per second for 45 seconds. These pillars are 40m tall and can go through terrain. This means that if the player is on top of a ramp on the outer areas of the arena and Mithrix smashes the ground underneath, the pillar can go through the ramp's ceiling and damage the player. These pillars can also be blocked by Defensive Microbots.

====Special: Shock Wave/Big Spinny====
After Mithrix performs his Shock Wave leap, his special skill is replaced by a new one which becomes available after a cooldown of 8 seconds. Once this new skill has been activated, it will revert back to Shock Wave.

With this new skill Mithrix creates 9 pillars that rotate either clockwise or anticlockwise. After 2 seconds they deal damage on the spot for 900% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 and also inflict Cripple. Mithrix will execute this attack 5 times in a row, with each time the rotation being random.

These pillars can be individually blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots}}, but the player must be within 20m of the center of rotation which makes it very hard to avoid the attacks. With high enough attack speed, it is possible to block them all before they go off.

====Behaviors====
Mithrix behaves the same away as in Phase 1, but he has one new behavior that supersedes every other in terms of priority for his new special attack.

#'''Use special (Big Spinny)''': Mithrix must have less than 80% health. In theory this will always be selected when the skill comes off cooldown after Shock Wave, since the latter requires less than 75% health to be used. However, if Mithrix has healing items from the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}, it is possible to use Shock Wave after having less than 75% health, but then recover to more than 80% before Big Spinny comes off cooldown.

===Phase 4===
Mithrix appears at the center of the arena and looks weakened with his armor broken and his hammer gone. He starts by stealing all players' and their allies' items, during which time he is invulnerable. Damaging him will release the items. See the [[Mithrix#Notes|Notes]] section for more details of how this works.  

The stealing of the player's items can be skipped if Mithrix takes damage in the first frame of the phase. This is due to his invulnerability being applied after a short window, and not being present on spawn. This is most easily done with continuous damage, most notably a {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band}} triggered in the center of the arena (which may occur when Mithrix's phase 3 is finished after his jump slam). This will leave Mithrix with no items, and the player with all of their items, resulting in a quick completion of this phase.  

Mithrix moves much slower than in the previous phases, slowly stomping around the arena and using exclusively ranged attacks. While his base damage is also weaker, the use of the stolen items can cause devastation. His HP is governed by a different formula and since he no longer has unique scaling, his max HP will be significantly lower. Any single instance of damage that deals more than 30% of his health will also stagger him. If the player has any Halcyon Seeds, {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} will spawn and help the player during this phase.  

There is a bug in which Mithrix will give the player Tonic Afflictions without either of them previously having any. &lt;!-- Is this still the case? I've never encountered it. --&gt; 

==== Primary: Needle Burst====
Similar to his needle attack from the previous phases, but there is less spread.

==== Secondary: Lunar Orbs====
Mithrix kneels and pounds the ground, creating a blast that deals 600% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 12m with linear falloff. This also creates a ring of 8 orbs that spiral outwards, converge back into the center and then spiral out again. Upon impact they deal 400% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with linear falloff. Their lifetime is 9s (plus a random 0.0-0.3 second offset), after which they will explode on the spot, so players should avoid being near them at that point.

Mithrix also deals 8% of his current health as non-lethal damage to himself.

This skill has an animation duration of 6 seconds which scales with attack speed.

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds, which does not start until the attack has finished.

==== Behaviors====
#'''Use secondary''': Mithrix must be within 180m from its target and have less than 90% health.
#'''Use primary''': no requirements as long as the skill is off cooldown.
#'''Chase''': no requirements.

===Aftermath===
Once Mithrix is defeated, all stolen items are returned and the moon begins a detonation sequence with an on-screen countdown. In order to exit Mithrix's arena, the surviving players must jump into one of the floating portals in order to teleport out. The players have 3 minutes to get to the Rescue Ship and complete its holdout event in order to escape, which requires the players to protect the ship by staying near it for 1 minute. Lines of flames will appear all across the map, similar to the columns used by some of Mithrix's attacks. {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}} and {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|}}{{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Exploder)|}}{{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)|Chimeras}} will spawn and attack the player, but they generally won't enter the protection zone of the Rescue Ship.

Successfully making it to the shuttle will complete the [[Washed Away]] challenge and unlock the {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} as a playable Survivor. Additionally, on {{EntityLink|Monsoon|altUrl=Difficulty#Monsoon}} difficulty, it will complete the [[The Calm]] challenge and unlock {{ItemLink|Purity}}, and unlocks the mastery skin for each player's current Survivor.

====Arena Escape Portals ====
[[File:Moon reference rock.png|thumb|180x180px]]
5 out of the 12 escape portals will randomly spawn, each with their own predefined teleport destination. They all rotate either clockwise or anticlockwise around the center of the arena at fixed radii lengths and heights. To identify them correctly, look for a big giant rock floating outside the arena and turn 180°. With your back against the reference point, the image below shows all the portals at the initial position they spawn and the direction they travel.

[[File:Moon escape orbs.png|border|1000x1000px]]

The teleport location and distance from the dropship for each escape portal is:

#On the bridge between the two Pillars of Design islands, 883.3 m away.
#In the middle of the Pillars of Blood area, 994.4 m away.
#On the far top floor of the Pillars of Soul area, 567.3 m away.
#On the back right of the Pillars of Blood area, 1022.9 m away.
#On the Cauldron island, 863.4 m away.
# On the Cauldron island near the chains towards the Pillars of Mass, 763.8 m away.
# On the ground floor or the Pillars of Soul area, 472.7 m away.
#On the Pillars of Design area, close to the center pillar leading to Mithrix, 736.3 m away.
#On the Pillars of Design area without the cauldrons, 874.2 m away.
#On the Pillars of Design area, very close to the center pillar leading to Mithrix, 721.1 m away.
#On the back left of the Pillars of Blood area, 1109.2 m away.
#On the far back of the Pillars of Blood area, 1058.8 m away.

==Notes==
*Mithrix steals items in two phases. In the first phase he steals an item from every player and their minions every 0.2 seconds for 9 seconds. In the second phase he steals an item every 0.1 second until all have been stolen. Due to frame rounding, in phase 1 he ends up stealing every 0.21666 seconds. Since the first item takes 1 second to reach Mithrix, he effectively registers 37 items from each entity at the end of phase 1. 
**While Mithrix steals items from minions, there is no visual effect of the item transfer.
*Mithrix will only use items stolen during the first phase, excluding all items from minions and any items in the [[:Category:AIBlacklist Items|AIBlacklist]] and [[:Category:BrotherBlacklist Items|BrotherBlacklist]] categories. As items are returned, it will be those from phase 1 first, even if Mithrix is not using them himself. 
**This means that if a player has 50 items, Mithrix will use any allowed items in 14-50. The items will be returned in the order 14-50, 1-13.
** While in single player Mithrix can use up to 37 items, in multiplayer this is very likely to be higher unless each player's last 37 items are the same.
*Mithrix cannot steal items from the [[:Category:CannotSteal Items|CannotSteal]] category. This also includes [[Items#Untiered|untiered]] items that are used for game mechanics, including AdaptiveArmor, BoostAttackSpeed, BoostDamage, BoostEquipmentRecharge, BoostHp, ConvertCritChanceToCritDamage, CutHp, DrizzlePlayerHelper, DroneWeaponsBoost, DroneWeaponsDisplay1, DroneWeaponsDisplay2, ExtraLifeConsumed, ExtraLifeVoidConsumed, FragileDamageBonusConsumed, Ghost, GummyCloneIdentifier, HealingPotionConsumed, HealthDecay, InvadingDoppelganger, MageAttunement, MinHealthPercentage, MinionLeash, MonsoonPlayerHelper, SkullCounter, TeamSizeDamageBonus, TeleportWhenOob, TonicAffliction, UseAmbientLevel, VoidmanPassiveItem.
*While Mithrix steals all items from players and minions, the accumulated damage threshold for returning an item is only the sum of items stolen during the first phase and only from players. 
**For example, for two players this will be up to 1/74 of his max health per item. Note that this percentage is capped at 1/100.
**The items are returned one by one in the order they were obtained. In multiplayer, the items will be returned to players in round robin order, by player slot.
**The accumulated damage received is not decreased when Mithrix recovers health either from healing or shield recharging.
*Upon fully charging the Rescue Ship and beating the game, all players (dead or alive) will be awarded {{LunarCoin|10}} lunar coins.

==Tips==
*While players cannot issue attacking commands during Mithrix's spawning introduction, it is possible to damage him with attacks that can be triggered automatically.
**{{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} with a number of damaging equipment, e.g. {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}.
**Activating {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}} and aiming where Mithrix spawns.
**{{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets. His mines can also be triggered if placed close enough to the center.
**Entering {{SurvivorLink|Huntress|Huntress's}} {{SkillLink|Ballista}} targetting mode before Mithrix spawns ensures they will auto-fire after the blue shield has disappeared.
**Having {{ItemLink|Resonance Disc}} fully charged before entering the arena ensures it will fire at Mithrix as soon as he becomes a viable target.
**{{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} {{SkillLink|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|Captain}} can be used to effectively and reliably one-shot, or at the very least, severely damage Mithrix. However, this requires exact timing, and the player should ideally have high stacks of {{ItemLink|Crowbar|Crowbars}}, {{ItemLink|Runald's Band|Runald's Bands}}, and/or {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}. When first entering the arena, place the DIABLO Strike in the center of the arena. When the cooldown timer reaches 29 seconds, run to the center of the arena and initiate the fight. During Phase 2, leave 1 enemy alive (avoid any offensive drones or minion items for this to work), then place a DIABLO Strike in the center of the arena. Wait until the cooldown timer reaches 28 seconds and kill the last enemy. If the player has {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, it will also instantly kill Mithrix when he begins Phase 4.
* Mithrix cannot climb the pillars that appear on Phase 2, so if the player gets on top of them and uses ranged attacks, Phase 3 and 4 will be very easy. The ranged attack on Phases 3 and 4 can be easily dodged from higher ground as well. '''HOWEVER, the lines of flame in Phase 3 can still hit the player.'''
*{{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|Snapfreeze|Artificer}} and {{SkillLink|Cast Nano-Spear|Artificer}} skills are capable of freezing and executing Mithrix, unlike other bosses. 
**The player can use {{SkillLink|Ion Surge|Artificer}} to avoid the entirety of Mithrix's first phase.
*On-kill items, such as {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}} and {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}, are almost useless for Mithrix, as they will not activate unless he kills a player or ally.
*Mithrix will use {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}} during Phase 4, but they have no effect against players.  
**He can still kill drones and {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} with them.
* If Mithrix takes a {{ItemLink|Purity}} in Phase 4, he will almost constantly fire projectiles.
*Mithrix will take and use any {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}s during Phase 4, making the fight significantly harder for survivors who rely on dealing a rapid amount of low damage hits, like {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} or {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}. 
**This is particularly troublesome for {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}, as {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}} will stop both of his utility and special skills, forcing him to rely on his equipment and primary.
*Mithrix will take {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} during Phase 4, and he will use it if given the chance. However, players will regain an ''unspent'' Dio's Best Friend along with all other stolen items upon Mithrix's ''first'' death. If Dio's Best Friend is recovered before Mithrix dies, he won't gain a second life.
*When the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is enabled, two Mithrices will spawn. Players must kill both bosses before they will advance from one phase to the next. However, when one's health is emptied, it will be incapacitated until the next phase.
**This is especially dangerous if both Mithrices use their fire wheel attack at once, making it exceedingly difficult to dodge.
**As with other enemies, if one Mithrix hits the other while {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is active, they will begin to attack each other. This is highly likely to happen during his stomp attack, and makes the fight significantly easier.
*During Phase 4, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Solus Probe|altText=Solus Probes}} spawned from {{ItemLink|itemName=Empathy Cores}} remain with the player and deal significant damage to Mithrix, making the phase noticeably easier.
**Be wary that when Mithrix steals the Empathy Cores, he gains his own Probes which are allied with ''him'' that will attack the player.
**The same thing happens when Mithrix steals the {{ItemLink|itemName=Queen's Gland}}, which is especially dangerous since the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Guard}} ally he will gain is much stronger than a normal Beetle Guard.
*Using [[Goobo Jr.]] at Phase 4 deals huge damage to Mithrix, while player stay in safe space, without any drawbacks.
*The {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}} can create a ghost of Mithrix.


==Dialogue==
Mithrix and {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} are unique in that both bosses speak throughout the fight, with quotes appearing in the chat box. His dialogue may change depending on what items the player holds or which character they are playing as.

==Trivia==
*There is an unused introduction to the fight where Mithrix spawns sitting on a throne instead of dropping in from the sky.
*The Hammer Smash is conditionally set to be the primary skill if Mithrix is not sprinting or is grounded. This means that if Mithrix sprints, so that the skill switches to Needle Barrage, but then jumps, the skill will switch back to Hammer Smash upon landing even if Mithrix is still sprinting.
*The Big Spinny attack has also been referred to as the "Forbidden Pizza" by a Gearbox Community Manager in the V1.3.8 Patch Notes, referring to it as the official name. As an inside joke, a developer note contradicts this.
*In the code there is an unused idea when Mithrix uses his Shock Wave on Phase 3, where he spawns an undetermined number of glass-looking copies of himself that last for 20 seconds, have much lower stats and can only use the secondary skill. As it currently stands, 0 such copies spawn.
*Shock Wave actually holds 5 charges and requires all 5 to activate the skill. After coming off cooldown all 5 charges will be replenished. Mithrix would need 5 {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell|Lysate Cells}} in order to be able to use the skill twice in a row. But the cooldown would still replenish only 5 charges at a time.
** On Phase 3 after activating the skill once, it would switch to Big Spinny and each Lysate Cell would grant an extra charge. However, upon using this once, it would revert back to Shock Wave regardless of how many charges it had remaining.
*While Hammer Smash and Hammer Swing have long end lag delays, it is possible to use the Dash to cancel them and regain control much faster. If Mithrix is in close range and has at least 1 Dash charge, he can use both skills in quick succession.
*Mithrix’s theme is "You're Gonna Need a Bigger Ukulele."
*Mithrix on Phase 4 still retains his Dash and Shock Wave skills, but he is not programmed to use them.
*The Big Spinny flame walls extend outwards for 300m. The arena is big enough that if Mithrix is executing the attack near the edges, the walls will not reach the opposite side.
*The blue flame wall attacks that occur during the aftermath of the fight are actually executed by a hidden character called "BrotherHaunt". Brother is the internal name for Mithrix.
*Any one of Mithrix’s three encounters have the chance to drop his Logbook.
*Mithrix attacks are similar to those of his brother in the original Risk of Rain.
**Both have an attack where they swing their weapon forward.
**Mithrix Shock Wave Leap is similar to to Providence's Leap Sword Strike and his Shockwave attacks.
**Mithrix thrusts his hammer onto the ground for his Rotating Fire Walls attack in a similar way to Providence and his Shockwave attack.
**Mithrix's [[Lunar Chimera (Golem)]] is similar to the Sanctuary Guards that Providence summons.
**In Risk of Rain Returns, Providence gets new moves which are also similar to his brother's.
***He thrusts his sword on the ground, spawning 9 lasers of energy, similarly to Mithrix' 9 Flame Walls attack.
***He summons orbs similar to Mithrix', though these fly instead of moving on the ground, and their behavior is different.
***He will occasionally dash in his last phase, like Mithrix does.
***He can erupt lasers similarly to how Mithrix can spawn fire pillars.
*The line "BROTHER... PERHAPS... WE WILL GET IT RIGHT... NEXT TIME..." may mean that Mithrix and Providence's species is capable of resurrection or regeneration.
*When Mithrix steals the player's items on phase 4, he will gain spikes on parts of his body colored by the type of item he steals, for example uncommon items would give him green spikes:
&lt;div class="mw-customtoggle-dialog customtoggle nomobile"&gt;Expand example image of the spikes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"&gt;

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

The item increases the holder's [[Damage|attack speed]] by 7.5% (''+7.5% per stack''), and their base [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] by 7% (''+7% per stack'').

== Notes ==
* The {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}} increases the player's attack speed by 15%, and {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}} increases their movement speed by 14%. The buffs granted by Mocha are equal to exactly half the buffs granted by each of those items.

== Lore ==

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|

* (Undocumented) Added New Item: Mocha
}}

== Trivia ==
* The icon on the cup bears a resemblance to the difficulty icon for {{EntityLink|Drizzle}}.
* This item's logbook entry is a reference to [[w:c:animalcrossing:Brewster|Brewster]] from the ''Animal Crossing'' series, a pigeon who runs a coffee shop (hence the "coo" at the end). He always reminds patrons to drink their coffee while it is still hot. The shipping address being "Ninten Island" is a further reference.
* The item is based on the [[w:c:starstormmod:Coffee Bag|Coffee Bag]] from the fan-made Risk of Rain mod ''Starstorm''.

'''Modding''' the game is currently possible on PC. This page serves as an entry into the world of [[Risk of Rain 2]] modding and installing mods.

The [[Developer Console]] can be accessed by hitting &lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Alt + `&lt;/code&gt; on the US key layout.

The modding wiki can be found [https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki here].

==Installing Mods==
''Note that the programs listed here are not officially supported by devs, but they are cool with modding.''&lt;ref&gt;"I dont know how tricky it is legally to implement mods officially, I definitely want to make sure we dont step on the toes of any community-made content with official content" - hopoo ([https://discord.com/channels/417739215355510784/559901453834256404/754473963408588891 Source])&lt;/ref&gt;

It is '''highly recommended''' that you use [https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/ r2ModMan], which is a mod manager that can download mods directly from [https://thunderstore.io/ Thunderstore], a site which contains the vast majority of Risk of Rain 2 mods. Alternatively, you can install them manually:
*Install [https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/ BepInExPack].
* Install [https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/ R2API]. Consult this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swJSeXWLtqQ guide] if you need help.
*Unless specified differently by the mod, they usually go into the &lt;code&gt;Risk of Rain 2/Bepinex/plugins/&lt;/code&gt; folder.

For tech support regarding mods not working correctly, you can ask for help in the modding Discord found on the top of the [https://thunderstore.io/ Thunderstore page].

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

When activated, it launches a large molotov projectile (which is affected by gravity) which explodes upon impact or after 2 seconds, splitting into 6 smaller molotovs with the same lifetime. However, the smaller projectiles explode only upon impact with terrain, bouncing off from any enemies in their path. Both the large and small projectiles deal 250% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a 7m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]], while inflicting {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|ignite}} enemies. The smaller projectiles leave behind lingering fire pools that deal 100% damage every 0.5 seconds with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.5. The fire pools last for 7 seconds.

==Tips==
* {{color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of ''500% damage'' is incorrect.
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} will boost this equipment's power significantly.
* Since the pools of fire spawn from the individual molotovs rather than the 6-pack itself, throwing the 6-pack directly at your target will often cause the molotovs to bounce away from the target. Due to this it is often better to have the 6-pack land next to the target and to hope that the molotovs go in the right direction.
* This equipment can deal great damage to large monsters like {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen|Beetle Queens}} due to their large hitboxes, but flying monsters like {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant|Wandering Vagrants}} are especially difficult to hurt since the fire pools will rarely, if ever, hit them.

==Lore==

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Survivors of the Void Update]]
*(Undocumented) Added New Item: {{PAGENAME}}

== Trivia ==
* The model for the large projectile depicts a group of 5 molotovs, even though it breaks up to 6 smaller ones.

[[File:Molten Perforator - demo.mp4|alt=Demonstration of Molten Perforator proc|right|thumb|Demonstration of Molten Perforator proc. Notice the magma balls coming out of the beetles shot.]]
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Magma Worm}}. 

When the holder damages an enemy, there is a 10% chance that 3 magma balls will spawn, each exploding with a radius of 7m, dealing 300% (''+300% per stack'') [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] and {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|igniting}} enemies.

Each magma ball has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.7. 

==Notes==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} This item does total damage, meaning it deals 300% of the damage of the hit that triggered it, not 300% base damage.
* While the magma balls tend to miss small enemies like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alloy Vulture|altText=Alloy Vultures}}, they work exceptionally well against large enemies like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Elder Lemurian|altText=Elder Lemurians}} and [[Monsters#Bosses|bosses]].
* Having an {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank}} makes the magma balls inflict {{StatusEffectLink|StrongerBurn}} instead of {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire}}, dealing incredible damage.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Monster Tooth|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder kills an enemy, a healing orb spawns where that enemy died, which heals the player for 8 HP plus an additional 2% ''(+2% per stack)'' of their maximum health when collected. The orbs last for roughly 10 seconds each, and will blink when about to expire. 

== Notes ==
* The player must approach the orbs to pick them up, although the orbs will automatically come to the player at a short distance.
* This item is much stronger on melee [[Survivors]], since the player will always be close to the enemies they defeat.
* Obtaining 50 stacks of Monster Teeth grants 100% healing per orb. This is reduced with {{ItemLink|itemName=Rejuvenation Rack|altText=Rejuvenation Racks}}; having one Rack requires half as many Monster Teeth (25), having two Racks requires a third as many (17), so on and so forth.
* The{{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} works well with this item, since it will spawn the orbs 8 times while in its duration. The player must take care to throw the doll somewhere nearby, though, or else the orbs will be wasted.
* If a Monster such as a {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} creates its own Monster Tooth orb only Monsters will be able to collect it, you and all allies cannot interact with it.
* Each stack increases the size of the healing orbs slightly, although this change is barely noticable at lower stack amounts.
**Oddly enough, the collision radius of the orbs is larger than the collection radius. This means that if millions of stacks of Monster Tooth are collected, then the player will have to gain fairly significant height to actually collect the orb. This will never matter during normal play.

      <text bytes="27201" sha1="kqerctq6vgjknwlfk6nws5kecer1ise" xml:space="preserve">'''Monsters''' are hostile entities and serve as the main threat to [[Survivors]]. There are {{#invoke:Enemies|TypeCount|All}} monsters currently in the game, and information about them can be viewed in the Logbook.

Bosses (not to be confused with [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]]) are a category of monster with much higher health and damage output, and are as such more threatening to the player than most regular monsters.

Any given monster has a 1% chance to drop its Monster Log if any player in the party has not yet acquired that entry. If the monster is a Teleporter Boss, Special Boss, or Horde of Many, this drop chance is 3% instead. These drop chances ''are'' affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and/or {{ItemLink|Purity}} of the player that defeats the monster.

All monsters use the same concept of skill slots as Survivors do, usually with a cooldown. Typically monsters only have skills assigned to some of them, in the order of Primary, Secondary, Utility and Special. This means that if they gain items that affect specific skill slots (such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Backup Magazine}}) this will affect how they behave and what other effects might trigger (such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shuriken}}). This is seen during the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}} event, in the {{SotV}}[[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]], and when the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} is enabled.

Note that names with the {{SotV}} icon are exclusive to the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

==Regular Monsters==
There are currently {{#invoke:Enemies|TypeCount|Normal}} normal monsters in the game.
{{#invoke:Enemies|MonsterGallery|Normal}}

==Bosses==
There are currently {{#invoke:Enemies|TypeCount|Boss}} bosses in the game.
{{#invoke:Enemies|MonsterGallery|Boss}}

== Special Monsters ==
Special monsters are monsters that have special requirements for spawning. There are currently {{#invoke:Enemies|TypeCount|Special}} special monsters in the game.
{{#invoke:Enemies|MonsterGallery|Special}}

==Special Bosses==
These bosses do not normally appear, and have special requirements for spawning. There are currently {{#invoke:Enemies|TypeCount|Special Boss}} special bosses in the game.
{{#invoke:Enemies|MonsterGallery|Special Boss}}

==Other Monsters==
There are currently {{#invoke:Enemies|TypeCount|Ally}} others monsters in the game. They are modified versions of monsters and are spawned from items. They are generally allied to the player, but {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} stealing them or the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} can make them appear on the monsters' side.
{{#invoke:Enemies|MonsterGallery|Ally}}

==Table==
{{MonstersTable}}

==Elites==
'''Elite''' monsters are similar to their basic comrades, but they have a different color, head adornment, extra health, and added abilities. They can be easily recognized by their altered appearance and a symbol on their health bar.

Elite monsters have a very small chance to drop their Elite buff as an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Equipment]]. The drop chance for this is 0.025%, or 1 in 4000. This is affected by {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

There are 5 tiers of Elite monsters, though outside of Tiers 1 and 2 there is hardly any indication of their relative strength. The following information is also summarised in [[Directors#Monster &amp; Elite tiers|this table]].
*'''Tier 1''' consists of the [[#Blazing|Blazing]], [[#Glacial|Glacial]], [[#Overloading|Overloading]], {{SotV}}[[#Mending|Mending]], and {{SotS}}[[Monsters#Gilded|Gilded]] Elites, who have 4 times the health (Mending Elites 3, Gilded Elites 6) and 2 times the damage (Gilded Elites 3) of a normal variation of that monster. These elites can appear starting from stage 1, except from Gilded Elites which start appearing from stage 3.
*'''Tier 2''' consists of the [[#Malachite|Malachite]], [[#Celestine|Celestine]], and {{SotS}} [[Monsters#Twisted|Twisted]] Elites who have 18 times the health and 6 times the damage (Twisted Elites only 13 and 10 respectively). Tier 2 Elites only appear after stage 5.
*'''Lunar''' consists of only the [[#Perfected|Perfected]] Elites, which have 2 times the health and 2 times the damage. This is reserved for Lunar monsters which cannot naturally be of any other elite tier.
*'''Void''' consists of only the {{SotV}}[[#Voidtouched|Voidtouched]] Elites, which have 1.5 times the health and 0.7 the damage. This is reserved for monsters spawned by [[Void Seed]]s or infested by a {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}}.
*'''Honor''' consists of a modified version of the Blazing, Glacial, Overloading and Mending Elites, which have 2.5 times the health (Mending Elites only 1.5) and 1.5 times the damage. These elites only spawn with the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}}.
Keep in mind this information only states raw stats increases and not the full effects that their affix gives, which can modify the damage/durability more than their raw stats might suggest.

All monsters can be Elite, even Bosses, except for {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm|Magma Worms}}, {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm|Overloading Worms}}, and {{EntityLink|Twisted Scavenger|Twisted Scavengers}}, unless they get corrupted by a {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}}. ''See also the notes.''

Certain [[Items]] interact with Elites:  
*On kill, {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}} grants the attacker the slain Elite's effects for a short duration.
*On kill, {{ItemLink|Brainstalks}} removes all skill cooldowns from the holder for a short duration.
*On kill, {{ItemLink|Defense Nucleus}} spawns a friendly {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct}} where the enemy died.
* {{ItemLink|Old Guillotine}} makes the holder instantly kill Elites who fall below a certain threshold of HP with any instance of damage.

===Blazing===  
*Red Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed}}" name prefix, are colored red and/or orange, and have curved ibex-like horns.
*They leave behind a fiery trail that deals 150% damage per second on contact.
*Their attacks {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire}} their targets, dealing an extra 50% total [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage over time]].
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|Ifrit's Distinction}}

===Overloading===
*Blue Elites receive an "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue}}" name prefix, are colored blue, and have two short horns on their forehead.
*50% of their health is replaced by shields that rapidly recharge 7 seconds after they've stopped taking damage.
*Their attacks attach a bomb to the target, which explodes after 1.5 seconds for 50% total damage in a 4m radius. This is unaffected by [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficients]].
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|Silence Between Two Strikes}}

===Glacial ===  
*White Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite}}" name prefix, are colored white, light blue, and/or cyan, and have a crown of crystals.
*Their attacks apply an {{StatusEffectLink|Slow80}} on hit for 1.5 seconds. ''See [[Movement Speed]] and [[Status Effects]].''
* On death, they leave behind an ice bomb that explodes after 2 seconds. The explosion hurts all players in its radius for 150% base damage and freezes them for 1.5 seconds.
* Equipment item: {{ItemLink|Her Biting Embrace}}

=== {{SotV|noTooltip=true}}Mending===
{{MonsterPage|Healing Core}}
*Mending Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixEarth}}" name prefix, are colored green and red, and have antlers similar to the {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}.
*They will passively heal the nearest damaged ally within 30m for 40% [[Damage|base damage]] 4 times per second, except for other Mending Elites.
* On death, they produce a destructible Healing Core that detonates after 3 seconds and heals all nearby characters in a 12m radius for a flat 80hp, including Survivors.
*Unlike other Tier 1 Elites, Mending Elites have only 3 times the health of a normal monster.
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|itemName=His Reassurance}}

===Malachite===
* Poison Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixPoison}}" name prefix, are colored blackish green like [[wikipedia:Malachite|malachite]] crystals, and have slender spikes on their heads. Blackish green particles are also present in a large area around them, and a loud howling sound plays whenever a Malachite Elite spawns.
*Their attacks {{StatusEffectLink|HealingDisabled|disable the target's healing}} for 8 seconds.
*They release 3-9 spiked balls every 6 seconds, which explode for 100% damage in a 7m radius and sprout spike pits where they land, which also do 100% damage on contact.
*On death, they spawn a {{MonsterLink|Malachite Urchin}} that shoots spikes at the player until it expires.
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Retort}}

===Celestine=== 
*Haunted Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixHaunted}}" name prefix, are colored sky blue like [[wikipedia:Celestine (mineral)|celestine]] crystals, and have a circlet.
*They create a large spherical aura around themselves that grants{{StatusEffectLink|AffixHauntedRecipient|invisibility}} to non-Celestine monsters within. Monsters that are invisible can still be attacked and damaged.
*Their attacks apply an {{StatusEffectLink|Slow80}} on hit for 3 seconds. ''See [[Movement Speed]] and [[Status Effects]].''
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|Spectral Circlet}}

===Perfected=== 
*Perfected Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixLunar}}" name prefix and have a white halo on their faces. These Elites only appear on {{EntityLink|entityName=Commencement}} or during a Lunar Chimera [[Family Events|Family Event]].
* 100% of their health is replaced by shields that rapidly recharge 7 seconds after they stop taking damage.
*Their attacks apply the {{StatusEffectLink|Cripple}} debuff for 3 seconds, reducing the [[armor]] and movement speed of any player hit.
*Every 10 seconds, they fire a barrage of 4 projectiles that deal 30% damage each.
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|Shared Design}}

==={{SotV|noTooltip=true}}Voidtouched===
*Voidtouched Elites receive a "{{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}}" name prefix, are colored purple, and have a {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}} on their face or some other prominent area. Additionally, their health bar turns purple like other void-based creatures. These monsters will also join the Void team, which is separate from the Player and Monster teams, meaning it will become hostile to other, non-void and non-voidtouched monsters and players alike.
*They are created in a unique way compared to other Elites; they only appear due to a Void Infestor corrupting a normal enemy or by spawning alongside a Void Seed at the start of a stage.
*They receive damage negation equivalent to a single {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}}, and a 100% chance on hit to apply the {{StatusEffectLink|Fracture}} debuff (which is multiplied by the hit's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]). Since they technically acquire the Safer Spaces shield behavior without having any stacks of the item, the [[Safer Spaces#Math|cooldown duration]] is the full 15 seconds.
*On death, they will spawn the Void Infestor that was infesting them. Technically speaking, the spawned Infestor is a different entity from the original and will have the full HP, but it will always be level 1 and thus very easy to kill.  
**The Void Infestor will only spawn if the enemy has no {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}} left.
* Like all Elites, Voidtouched Elites have a corresponding aspect equipment item. However, it cannot be obtained through normal gameplay - it does not have any chance to drop when the Elite is killed (a Void Infestor is dropped instead). 
**Since an infested enemy receives the elite equipment, if that enemy was previously another type of elite, its type will be overridden. The now infested elite will not lose any damage/health boosts they had before infestation, but they will lose any abilities the old elite type granted. For example, an infested Malachite Elite will have 24 times the enemy's base health and only 1.8 times the damage. They will also lose the ability to fire spikes, inflict {{StatusEffectLink|HealingDisabled|Healing Disabled}}, and spawn an Urchin upon death.

==={{SotS|noTooltip=true}} Gilded=== 
* Gold Elites receive a {{StatusEffectLink|Gilded}} name prefix and appear golden. These Elites only appear starting Stage 3 or via the completion of a [[Halcyon Shrine]] event.
*When they hit a character, they knock gold nuggets out of them that disappear after 10 seconds.
**Regardless of the Elite's or the target's team, these nuggets can only be picked up by players and their allies.
* The base value of each gold nugget is &lt;math&gt;baseGold = 8 \times diffCoeff^{1.25}&lt;/math&gt;. The total gold knocked out depends on the following scenarios:
**If the target is a player, knock out 1 nugget if the damage received is less than 40% of the player's max health, 2 nuggets between 40%-60%, and 3 nuggets for 60%+. The minimum value between &lt;math&gt;amount \times baseGold&lt;/math&gt; and the player's gold is chosen, which is rounded down to multiples of ''baseGold''. This value is taken out of the player's inventory and it is possible for it to be 0.
***The damage value is the actual damage received after any [[armor]] reductions and item effects.
**If the target is not a player, chose the maximum value between 80% of the target's gold and ''baseGold'', which is rounded down to multiples of ''baseGold''. This value does not reduce the target's current gold (which is also tied to their death rewards). This means a minimum of 1 nugget will always drop.
*The Elite also fires a projectile for a target within 50m which appears under their feet. It has an initial cooldown of 10 seconds and after that it is 10 seconds plus a random offset between 0 and 3 seconds.
*When the projectile is ready to be fired, a sound can be heard and the projectile appears after 1 second. The attack itself comprises of two components.
**The outer torus detonates after 1.15 seconds and deals 15% damage with a 0.1 [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. This can hit all teams indiscriminately and doesn't knock out any gold.
**The inner circle detonates after 1.95 seconds and deals 150% damage with a 1.0 proc coefficient.
*The inner circle of the projectile also knocks out gold based on its own calculations, which are in addition to any nuggets that naturally come out when the Elite hits its target. The blast can knock out up to 10 gold nuggets in total, but no more than 3 nuggets per target. The value per nugget is ''baseGold''. 
**If the target is a player, the minimum value between 3 ''baseGold'' and the player's current gold is chosen, which is rounded down to multiples of ''baseGold''. This amount is taken away from the player and it can be 0.
* Equipment item: {{ItemLink|Aurelionite's Blessing}}
**There are differences between how this Elite power behaves when yielded by monsters and players. See Aurelionite's Blessing for more details.
==={{SotS|noTooltip=true}} Twisted===  
*Twisted Elites receive a {{StatusEffectLink|Twisted}} name prefix and appear blue and have spikes on their backs. When their power is active, a blue crystal also appears above their heads.
*They tether themselves to any allies within 35m for up to 5 targets.
**Any elite allies are ignored.
**The same ally can be tethered by multiple Elites.
**These allies gain 300 [[armor]] by the hidden {{StatusEffectLink|Twisted Armor}} buff.
***If an ally is tethered to multiple Twisted Elites, it will receive this buff multiple times, making them extremely resistant to damage.
**Only allies of the same team can be tethered. As such, void enemies (when they spawn on the void team) are ignored.
*If a tethered ally is damaged, the Elite charges the crystal and after 10 hits have been registered, it releases a projectile.
**If an ally is tethered to multiple Elites, they will all register it individually.
**When a hit is registered by the Elite, it will ignore any more hits for the next 0.1 seconds. This means that if you damage two monsters tethered to the same Elite with the same attack, it will only register as one hit.
**The hits are cumulative even if the Elite breaks its tether from any allies.
**Every time a hit is registered, the crystal above the Elite's head grows larger. After 9 hits it flashes and on the 10th it starts vibrating for 2 seconds before releasing the projectile.
**The target of the projectile is whoever dealt the final hit.
*The projectile has 350 health and homes in on the target slowly at 12 m/s. After 14 seconds it will explode even without an impact. It deals 100% base damage with a 1.0 [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] in a 7m radius and [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot falloff]].
**The projectile can also be tethered by Twisted Elites, making it harder to destroy.
**It can be blocked by Captain's {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots}}.
*The projectile also inflicts 2 stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} for 420 seconds. 
**1 stack is from the projectile and the other because its owner is a Twisted Elite. Note, however, that the Elite's normal attacks do not inflict Lunar Ruin.
**If {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} were to hold this equipment, his {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} would also inflict 2 stacks for the same reason.
*After the projectile has been fired, the crystal, tethers, and damage registering become inactive for 10 seconds. The Elite, however, still retains its inherent health and damage boost.
* When the Elite is killed, it clears all {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} stacks from any enemy teams. 
**This means a monster would cleanse the debuff from both the player and void monsters.
**It discriminately removes all buff stacks regardless of the source that inflicted them. This also includes False Son's {{SkillLink|Lunar Spikes}} and the lightning strikes on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}. 
***While the debuff is removed, Lunar Spikes also inflicts a DoT which will continue ticking even without the debuff.
*Equipment item: {{ItemLink|His Spiteful Boon}}

===Notes=== 
*The {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}} is ''not'' regarded as an Overloading Elite version of the {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}}. They are similar, but separate species.
*Elite status does not confer any immunities, resistances, or armor additions.
*Glacial Elites' on-death explosion can be blocked with {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}.
*Despite their {{StatusEffectLink|AffixHauntedRecipient|invisibility}}, enemies within a Celestine Elites' sphere can still be targeted by most attacks that have automatic targeting, such as {{SurvivorLink|Huntress|altText=Huntress's}} attacks and {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|Thermal Harpoons|Engineer}}.
*Non-lunar Perfected enemies can be spawned through modding. All monsters but the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}} will lack the white halo, they will be tinted a saturated blue, and any part of their body that luminesces will be brighter than usual. They all function as normal.
*While monsters' families are usually irrelevant to normal gameplay, Void enemies will fight with non-Void enemies. This also includes Voidtouched monsters, who will become hostile towards their kin.

;[[Early Access Patch (Build ID No.3731106)]]
*Gameplay Changes
**'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed|**Fire Elites**}}'''
***'''[Community Suggestion]''' Rework burning calculation with unique new {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|burning}} damage type
***Number of stacks of Burning on the player are now visible in the buff bar.
***Burning is now capped at 5% of your health a second PER stack. Just to be clear - this is a nerf. It'll always hit for less this patch.
*** Now ticks at twice the frequency (but same overall damage).
***This damage type has also now been applied to the Magma Worm's impact and fireball damage, alongside Elder Lemurian's fire breath
***''The intent here is to make it clear to the player what exactly a burn DOES, regardless of how it's applied. Players never were told by the game that burning actually stacks. If you have a certain number of burn stacks, you will now be aware of exactly how much that will hit for. Overall this should make the burns way less bursty and way more consistent, also allowing heal over time effects to help counteract the damage. The intent is NOT to make the entire game easier, or to make burns never kill you. Fire elites are the only purely offensive elite-type, so they should be causing deaths. It should just feel less BS now.''
**'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite|**Ice Elites**}}'''
***Rework ice bomb
*** Improve graphics for ice bomb left when killed to be more clear.
***Ice bomb damage reduced from 350% to 150%
*** Ice bomb damage is no longer reduced at the edge of the radius
***Ice bomb now FREEZES characters in the radius for 1.5s
***''*Fire elites have always been the most threatening type, with the other 2 being pretty easy. The hope here is that after the nerf of the Fire affix, the Ice affix can now also be respected as a serious threat. The improved visuals should help clarify what the ice affix actually does - most players don't seem to notice it drops a bomb at all. We're starting with a low freeze duration to test how it feels.*''
**'''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue|**Lightning Elites**}}'''
***Lightning bombs from Lightning Elites now properly attach to players.
***Lightning elites now always spawn at full shields
***Improve lightning bomb graphics
*Bug Fixes
**Update Elite naming for localization and appearance in pings
}}

== Trivia== 
*Monsters can get stuck on a [[Shrine of Combat]] or [[Shrine of Chance]], where they then jump up and down repeatedly, dance around it, or stand completely still. This is due to their pathfinding not knowing how to get down from the Shrine.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by carrying 5 [[Items#Lunar|lunar items]] and/or [[Items#Lunar equipment|lunar equipment]] in a single run.

The 5 lunar items must be held simultaneously, and only the currently held equipment will be counted.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} is the only [[Survivors|Survivor]] able to carry 2 equipment at once via {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool|survivorName=MUL-T}}, which can make this challenge easier to complete; the player can hold an equipment of their choice for general use while storing away the lunar equipment until 4 other lunar items are collected.
* This challenge can be easily completed by finding and activating a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] to access the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, where the player can purchase lunar items for {{LunarCoin|2}} each. Repeat as many times as needed.
** Alternatively, if the player obtains an {{ItemLink|itemName=Egocentrism}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Eulogy Zero}} (from a [[Lunar Pod]] or the Bazaar), they can obtain another 4 lunar items without using any additional lunar coins.

The ''surfaceSpeedBoost'' is generally 0 with the tunnels in {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} being the only exception. The boost for the normal tunnel surface is 4, while for the sections glowing in blue it is 5.

The ''sprintMultiplier'' makes characters move faster when sprinting. In most cases this is 1.45 with the following exceptions:

* {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts|altText=Col. Droneman}} has 1.75 but cannot actually sprint.
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mini Mushrum}} has 2.5. (sprints when fleeing to heal).
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} has 2.6. (sprints when far away from the player).
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lunar Chimera (Golem)}} has 3.0. (sprints when far away from the player).
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Devastator}} has 4.0, though it does not sprint at all as AI.
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Larva}} has 8.0. (sprints constantly).

The ''lunarSpikesSpeedBonus'' is 0.05 for each secondary skill charge {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} has spent. By default he has 4 charges and when they are all been used up, his movement speed is 20% faster.

==Increases==
The increase multiplier starts at 1.0 and is increased by any of the following in order:

#{{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}} gives + 0.14 per stack.
#{{ItemLink|Mocha}} gives +0.07 per stack.
#{{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}} gives +0.1 per stack.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} gives +0.07.
#{{ItemLink|Hunter's Harpoon}} gives +0.25 per stack of the {{StatusEffectLink|Kill Move Speed}} buff.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Elusive Antlers Speed}} buff gives +0.12 per stack.
#If the character is a monster and the difficulty is [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 4]] or higher, +0.4.
#{{ItemLink|Energy Drink}} gives +0.25/sprintMultiplier per stack while sprinting.
#{{ItemLink|Red Whip}} gives +0.3 per stack while {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=WhipBoost}} is active.
#{{ItemLink|Warbanner|altText=Warbanners}}, which gives + 0.3 from the{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Warbanner}} buff.
#{{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Smoke Bomb|survivorName=Bandit}} give +0.4 while {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=CloakSpeed}} is active (these sources do ''not'' stack with each other).
#{{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron}} and {{ItemLink|Gorag's Opus}} give +0.5 from the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=WarCryBuff|altText=War Cry}}/{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TeamWarCry}} buffs, respectively (these do ''not'' stack with each other).
#Having the {{StatusEffectLink|Perfected}} affix gives +0.3.
#

==Decreases==
The decrease multiplier starts at 1.0 and is '''increased''' by any of the following in order:

#{{StatusEffectLink|Knockback Hit}} gives +1.0.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Slow50}} gives +0.5.
# {{StatusEffectLink|Slow60}} gives +0.6.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Slow80}} gives +0.8.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Tar}} gives +0.5.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Cripple}} gives +1.
#{{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} gives +1 per stack.

Note that since the above contributions are multiplied as baseSpeed / decreases, none of the numerical values imply a linear relationship of how much a character slows down. For example Slow50 effectively leads to a final speed of &lt;code&gt;baseSpeed / 1.5 = baseSpeed &amp;sdot; 0.66&lt;/code&gt;, i.e., a 33% decrease, while Slow50 with Slow60 together would combine for a total decrease of approximately 52.4%.

==Multipliers==
These factors multiply the value accumulated so far, effectively scaling the contributions of every item and buff in the previous sections.

# {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=BeetleJuice}} from the {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen|altText=Beetle Queen's}} flying beetles multiplies this by &lt;code&gt;1 - (0.05 &amp;sdot; stacks)&lt;/code&gt;.
#If a character is {{StatusEffectLink|Entangle|entangled}}, {{StatusEffectLink|Nullified|nullified}}, or {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Root|lunar rooted}}, fix their movement speed to 0.
#{{StatusEffectLink|Weak}} multiplies this by 0.6.
#{{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} multiplies this by 1.3 if {{StatusEffectLink|TonicBuff}} is active.
# {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}} multiplies this by &lt;code&gt;1 + 0.04 &amp;sdot; itemStacks &amp;sdot; buffStacks&lt;/code&gt;.
#If Spinel Tonic is not active and the character has any Tonic Afflictions, the speed is multiplied by &lt;code&gt;0.95^stacks&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Multikill!''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by killing 15 [[Monsters|enemies]] simultaneously.

==Tips==
* The window for landing a multikill is actually 1 second, so chaining together kills quickly will also count towards the challenge.
* Using a {{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} is a great way to gather enemies together and set up a big multikill. Combine it with several {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} for maximum effectiveness.
* Completing {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer|altText=Artificer's}} [[Artificer: Massacre|Massacre]] challenge will also immediately complete this challenge.
* Enabling the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} not only doubles the amount of enemies spawned but also halves their health, making this challenge substantially easier.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

As the holder heals, the item stores 100% (''+100% per stack'') of the healing as a hidden value, dubbed "Soul Energy." When this value reaches 10% of the holder's maximum health, the player launches a homing skull that deals fixed damage equal to 25% of their maximum health with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2 within a 40m radius. 

== Notes ==
* The skulls trigger even when healing at full health.
* Skulls are fired one at a time, so a large burst of healing (e.g. {{ItemLink|itemName=Foreign Fruit}}) will fire multiple skulls back to back.
* There is a minimum 0.1 second cooldown between skulls, for a maximum fire rate of 10 skulls per second. This results in a potential maximum DPS of 250% of the holder's max HP per second, assuming consistent healing.
* "Healing" implies actively regaining health from a source, where green numbers appear around the player signifying the healed amount; players' passive health regeneration, even when amplified by a {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}, {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}, or {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}, will ''not'' trigger any skulls to fire.
* Although the skulls can trigger on-hit healing effects, such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Leeching Seed}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Super Massive Leech}}, the healing from these items is ''not'' added to the Soul Energy value if the triggering hit is a skull.
* [[Health#Shield|Shields]] count as maximum health for the purpose of this item, even if the shields are currently damaged.
* The Soul Energy value cannot exceed the holder's full combined health (max health plus max shields). Given the item's high rate of fire, this is usually not a problem, however.
** Additionally, once the player's Soul Energy accumulates enough to activate N'kuhana's Opinion, it will deplete Soul Energy and attempt to fire, even if no enemies are in range. This makes it impossible to stockpile more than one second's worth of attacks, no matter how much healing the player has.

== Tips ==
* N'kuhana's Opinion is uniquely one of the only items that does not use the [[Survivors|Survivor's]] damage stat or Total Damage; its damage is directly tied to your combined Max Health and Shields. As the holder's health increases per-level and though items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Infusion}} and {{ItemLink|Personal Shield Generator}} , the skulls' damage increases, but so does the healing required to fire each skull.
**Flat healing, such as from {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}, isn't penalized for this increased health, as the increased damage typically offsets the higher threshold. However, fewer skulls may mean fewer item procs, so it's important to keep any flat healing up to scratch to keep N'kuhana's up to speed (and for the holder to avoid dying, as is typical of any run).
**Percentage-based healing, such as from {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}, grows stronger as the holder's max health increases, as the skulls fire at the same speed and simply deal more damage. However, it's important to remember that N'Kuhana's takes shield into account while these sources do not; {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} would increase the skulls' damage by 50%, but drop the holder's max HP to 1, effectively erasing any percentage-based healing.
*
*N'kuhana's does not benefit from the damage doubling from {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, and the halved HP cuts each skull's damage and required healing in half. As a side effect, flat healing can hit the 10% max HP threshold twice as quickly, while percentage-based healing does not benefit.
*{{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}} has some unusual interactions with N'kuhana's. Because it stores all healing and releases it at 10% of the holder's maximum health per second, large bursts of healing will fire one skull per second for an extended period of time. However, this means that the fire rate of those skulls is capped at 1 skull per second (compared to the limit of 10 per second) unless this is bypassed using {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}. Generally, Corposebloom is a downgrade if the user can reliably and continuously heal above 10% max health per second.
**Uniquely, because Corpsebloom steals and then releases all healing itself, it ignores the restrictions of on-hit healing triggered by skulls. This means a skull can activate on-hit healing, and since Corpsebloom is the item providing the final healing, it will count towards the Soul Energy value where it would normally be filtered out. This means one could theoretically have an infinite loop of consistent, if slow, N'Kahuna's skulls and healing, though this is difficult in practice.
*Although the skulls do not use the Damage stat, they can still [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically strike]] and are powered up by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Armor-Piercing Rounds}}, when applicable.
*This item can be extremely useful on {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}} when combined with Bustling Fungus. The turrets can consistently keep the Bustling Fungus active, since they do not move and are immune to knockback. Additionally, since both of the turrets and Engineer himself receive healing from the fungus and independently fire skulls, placing the turrets such that the healing zones overlap will activate N'kuhana's Opinion very rapidly, dealing high damage at very long range.
*{{SurvivorLink|REX}} excels with N'kuhana's Opinion, as their entire kit revolves around healing and life-steal. They will be able to activate this item very often.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} performs extremely well with this item, since her {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} skill heals a large portion of her maximum health and her health is much higher than any other Survivor's.
*The {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}} pairs exceptionally well with this item, effectively doubling the number of skulls fired.

'''N'kuhana's Retort''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} [[Monsters#Malachite|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Malachite Elite, but this chance is affected by {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with N'kuhana's Retort gains the power of a Malachite Elite; their attacks inflict the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HealingDisabled|altText=healing disabled}} debuff for 8 seconds, and they will periodically release 3-4 spiked balls. On impact, the balls create a small explosion for 100% damage and sprout spike pits that deal 100% contact damage. Additionally, when the equipped player dies, a {{MonsterLink|Malachite Urchin}} will spawn and shoot at nearby [[monsters]], but even with {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} this effect is of limited usefulness.

Although N'kuhana's Retort is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

==Tips==
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} can make considerably better use of this equipment than most Survivors, since his turrets can create their own spike balls and are expendable enough to trigger the on-death urchin.
*{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger|altText=Scavengers}} can potentially be highly vulnerable to having their healing disabled, as they can spawn with (or pick up) healing items. This equipment is especially useful for {{MonsterLink|Kipkip the Gentle|altImg=Twisted Scavenger}}, who wields many healing items.
*Giving this equipment to an [[Equipment Drone]] is a decent idea, as it will not only disable enemies' healing to help with synergies such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}}, but it can also deal damage by spawning spike pits.

==Trivia==
* Survivors holding the item will show some signs of dementia, with their head moving in abrupt motions. The only exceptions are {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} and {{SurvivorLink|REX}}, who will have their cannons moving abruptly instead.

'''Naturopath''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by interacting with the [[Teleporter]] after completing the 3rd [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] without healing.

Taking a [[Interactibles#Portals|Portal]] for the 3rd Teleporter Event will not complete the challenge. Completing Naturopath is slightly different from [[Warrior]], which completes after defeating the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]]. 

== Tips ==
* Health or healing items that prevent completing Naturopath: {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}, {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}, {{ItemLink|Medkit}}, {{ItemLink|Leeching Seed}}, {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}, {{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}}, {{ItemLink|Foreign Fruit}}, {{ItemLink|Gnarled Woodsprite}}, {{ItemLink|Mired Urn}}, {{itemLink|Planula}}, {{ItemLink|Super Massive Leech}}, {{ItemLink|Interstellar Desk Plant}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Weeping Fungus}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Remote Caffeinator}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=His Reassurance}}.
* Health or healing items that '''''do not''''' inhibit Naturopath: {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}, {{ItemLink|Personal Shield Generator}}, {{itemLink|Bison Steak}}, {{ItemLink|Infusion}}, {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}, {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}, {{itemLink|Pearl}}, {{itemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}, {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, {{ItemLink|Transcendence}},  {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Stone Flux Pauldron}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Plasma Shrimp}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Rejuvenation Rack}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}.
* {{EntityLink|Healing Drone|Healing Drones}}, {{EntityLink|Emergency Drone|Emergency Drones}}, and [[Shrine of the Woods|Shrines of the Woods]] can also inhibit this challenge.
* {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Beacon: Healing|Captain|altText=Healing Beacon}} can inhibit this challenge.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend|altText=Void Fiend's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppress}} can inhibit this challenge.
* {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}} ({{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}}) can inhibit this challenge.
* This challenge is extremely difficult when playing as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}}, due to the overwhelming focus of their skills on taking damage and immediately healing it. Even using their primary skill is enough to fail the challenge.
*It may be worth disabling the {{SotV}}[[Survivors of the Void]] expansion when attempting this challenge, as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Mending}} [[Monsters#Mending|Elites]] leave behind a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Healing Core}} when killed. If the Healing Core is not killed, it heals everything around itself, including the player and their allies, which will fail the challenge. Disabling the expansion will prevent Mending Elites from spawning, making this a non-issue.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corrupted version of the {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}. 

On hit, it gives a 10% (''+10% per stack'') chance to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Fracture}} on the target (which is multiplied by the hit's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]). 3 seconds after Collapse is first applied to a target, the effect will trigger, removing all stacks of Collapse on the target and dealing 400% damage per stack removed.

==Notes==
*By corrupting Tri-Tip Daggers Needletick removes only that source of inflicting{{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding|altUrl=Damage#Damage over Time}}. However, any other sources do not have their effect replaced by Collapse, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Noxious Thorn}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Unstable Transmitter}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Sawmerang}}.
*Enemies inflicted with Collapse have a pulsing red circle displayed on top of them, which grows in size and flashes more vigorously when Collapse is about to deal damage. 
** If an enemy dies before Collapse deals damage, the circle will remain at the position where it died.
* Because Collapse is of type [[Damage#Damage over Time|Damage over Time]], the damage dealt has a proc coefficient of 0.0.

== Tips== 
*Tri-Tip Daggers and Shatterspleen do not apply two separate stacks of bleed on hit making Tri-Tip daggers obsolete if players have enough crit chance for Shatterspleen. If players have Shatterspleen, it would be prudent to get Needleticks to get both Collapse and Bleed on hit.
*One stack of Bleed deals a total of 240% base damage over 3 seconds, while one stack of Collapse deals 400% base damage ''after'' 3 seconds. All stacks of Bleed have their durations refreshed when an additional new stack is inflicted, while all Collapse stacks expire at once after the 3-second countdown begins. 
**As a result, if the player has enough Tri-Tip Daggers and hit rate to repeatedly reset Bleed stacks, Bleed will outperform Collapse, especially in long fights. However, the Needletick is still useful at low stacks when resetting the Bleed duration would be unlikely, or for [[Survivors]] with very low hit rate.

{{MonsterPage|Void Reaver (Ally)}}
{{MonsterPage|Void Jailer (Ally)}}
{{MonsterPage|Void Devastator (Ally)}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update. It is the corruption of all [[Items#Boss Items|boss items]] (excluding {{ItemLink|itemName=Artifact Key|altText=Artifact Keys}}) and is dropped by the {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}.

Every 60 seconds (''-50% per stack''), the holder gets a friendly void ally, which is either a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}}, {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer}}, or (rarely) {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}. The holder may only have up to 1 (''+1 per stack'') void ally summoned this way at a time.

==Notes==
* {{color|note|Correction:}} The rate of cooldown is not -50% exponentially per stack, as the actual formula is 60/stacks. So while going from 1 to 2 stacks the cooldown increases by 50%, this does not follow the same pattern for any other stack number.
*Since the {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}} cannot normally spawn as a teleporter boss, the only way to obtain this item from the teleporter event is during a void [[Family Events|Family Event]], or if the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} is enabled which makes it possible for it to spawn as a teleporter boss. Even if the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is active, this item cannot be obtained from any other [[Monsters#Bosses|Bosses]].
**Alternately, one may acquire this item from a resurrection via {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}}, as long as a boss item was taken beforehand.
***Obtaining this item by corrupting a boss item with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}} will not unlock the Newly Hatched Zoea's logbook entry. To unlock its logbook entry, it has to be picked up as an item dropped by a {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}.
**Another option is using a {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} on a Void Devastator that can spawn within a [[Void Seed]]. However, this will probably not happen in the first few stages as the [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]] will not be high enough to afford the spawn (see [[Directors#The Camp Director|Camp Director]] for more information).
* This item will also corrupt the {{ItemLink|Pearl}} and {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}, since they have the Boss rarity.
*Umbrae from the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} will inherit the item and spawn Void allies, but will ''never'' drop the Newly Hatched Zoea, even if it was the Umbra's only item.
* The void ally types to spawn are added to a pool, with 15 copies of {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}}, 15 copies of {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer}}, and 1 copy of {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}. This gives probabilities of roughly 3.2% for a Devastator, and 48.3% for either a Reaver or Jailer.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is enabled, any {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver}} spawned from the item cannot target allies, even when aggravated. However, allies can still be damaged by their basic attack if it hits them when it's hitting an enemy.
*The void implosion created by allied void enemies can kill the player and their allies.

==Tips==
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets do ''not'' inherit the Newly Hatched Zoea (even though until the [[Seekers of the Storm]] meteor patch they did). However, they can obtain the item if they have {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}} and any {{Color|boss|boss}} items and are then resurrected. This is the only indirect way of spawning void allies without the player holding the item.
*Void implosions from void allies are still lethal to the player and their other void allies. Be mindful that one ally's death may lead to avalanching instant-kill explosions. 
**Notably, these void implosions cannot kill either of the final bosses, {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} and the {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}.
*There is a global ally limit of 20 at a time. This includes void allies, drones, squid turrets, or any other ally that appears on the left side of the screen. This means the ally spawn scaling of Newly Hatched Zoea hard caps at 20 stacks without any other allies. The cooldown however will be 3s, and will continue to decrease with further stacks.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[PC Patch v1.2.2.0]]
*(Undocumented) Fixed incorrect ally-cap stacking behavior
;[[Survivors of the Void]]

}}

==Trivia==
*In biology, the term "zoea" refers to a larval stage in development experienced by many ten-legged crustaceans, especially crabs. 
**This is in keeping with the crab-like appearance of the boss tied to the item, the {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}, which seems to imply that the item itself is some form of the boss's offspring.
***Furthermore, the item's ability to summon a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}} or {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer}}, as opposed to just the {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}} which dropped it in the first place, might suggest that all three monsters are directly related to one another in some way.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' are [[interactables]] that can be found on every standard [[Environments|Environment]], usually hidden or in hard-to-reach areas. There are 3 to 5 possible Newt Altar spawn locations per stage.

Donating {{LunarCoin|1}} to the Newt Altar will cause a Blue Orb to appear at the [[Teleporter]], spawning a Blue Portal once the Teleporter is charged. Entering the Blue Portal will take the player to the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}. 

Newt Altars cannot be activated after the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] is completed.

It is possible, though rare, for 2 Newt Altars to spawn on the same Environment; however, only 1 of the 2 Altars can be interacted with and does not result in any additional gameplay changes. Sometimes no Newt Altar is spawned, although it is very rare to occur.

'''Newtist''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by activating 8 unique [[Newt Altars]].

It is not required to activate those 8 Altars on 8 different [[Environments]], nor is it required to activate all 8 in a single run, but each one must be at a different spot from the others.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

When the holder damages an enemy, there is a 10% chance to {{StatusEffectLink|Bleed}} the target. When they kill an enemy, 33% of the enemy's debuffs are transferred to 1 (+1 per stack) enemies within a 20m (+5m per stack) radius.

==Notes ==
*The number of debuff transferred is rounded up. Therefore a single stack is enough to be transferred.
*When a [[Damage#Damage over Time|DoT]] or a timed debuff is transferred, the total duration of that debuff is also transferred. For example, if a {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}} bleeds the enemy from an attack with a 1.0 [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]], the duration of the bleed is 3 seconds. If this enemy is then killed while the bleed still has 1.2 seconds left, the duration of the bleed transferred will still be the full 3 seconds.
**However, the same does not to apply to {{StatusEffectLink|Burn}}, for example. In this case each stack ticks independently of any newly inflicted stacks and their total duration is not refreshed similar to bleed. If the first burn stack has a total duration of 1 second, while any of the following ones have 2 seconds, the transferred duration will be only 1 second, because the item looks at the total duration of only the first instance in the list.
*The following debuffs are not transferred: {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Entangle}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Ruin}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Lunar Root}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Permanent Curse}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Disable All Skills}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Knockback Hit}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Knockback Juggle Count}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Soul Cost}}.

==Tips==
*This item synergizes very well with {{ItemLink|Death Mark}}.
*While most debuffs are applied for a limited duration, {{StatusEffectLink|Permanent Armor Reduction}} is permanent, which makes this item very useful for transferring some of the built up stacks to the next target.

== Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
*Bug Fixes
**Debuffs will now correctly trigger the {{ItemLink|Death Mark}} effect when being transferred between enemies via {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn}}.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.6]]
*Reworked {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn}}.
**Old Functionality: 25% chance on being hit to inflict nearby enemies with 2 (+1 per stack) stacks of bleed. If enemies are already inflicted with one or more stackable debuffs, add 1 (+1 per stack) to those debuffs instead.
**New Functionality: Gain 10% chance to bleed an enemy. On killing an enemy, transfer 33% of every debuff stack to 1 enemy (+1 per stack) within 20m (+5m per stack).
----
;[[Patch v1.3.5]]
*Resolved an issue players reported where applying {{StatusEffectLink|Bleed|bleed}} with {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn|Noxious Thorns&lt;sup&gt;[sic]&lt;/sup&gt;}} could make [[monsters]] turn on each other and ignore the player.
*Addressed another reported issue with {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn}} where it would not correctly apply + 1 stack of another active debuff. It had sometimes only been applying its bleed stack.
----
;'''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'''
* Added New Item: Noxious Thorn

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2.

While activated, the player gets the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=FullCrit}} status for 8 seconds, giving them +100% [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] chance.

== Tips ==
* This item can help activate {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}}, {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}}, and more rarely {{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen}} obtained early in a run when the player has minimal critical strike chance. 
**The attack speed buff from {{ItemLink|War Horn}} is quite helpful for getting the most use out of these items as well, and one stack lasts exactly as long as the HUD does.

*Collecting {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} and {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned|altText=Gestures of the Drowned}}, it is possible to gain 100% uptime on the guaranteed critical strikes. While usually more difficult than collecting 9 or 10 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, it allows a player to run {{ItemLink|itemName=Lost Seer's Lenses|altText=Lost Seer's Lenses}} without losing use of items that rely on critical strikes.

* The HUD is somewhat less useful for {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}}, as his passive {{SkillLink|skillName=Backstab|survivorName=Bandit}} makes it irrelevant if the player is skilled enough to get behind enemies.

*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}}'s {{SkillLink|Magnetic Accelerator}} turns the +100% critical strike chance into +100% critical strike damage when used.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

After 7 seconds of not taking damage, the holder gets the {{StatusEffectLink|OutOfCombatArmor}} buff, increasing [[armor]] by 100 (''+100 per stack'') until they take damage again.

== Math==
The amount of damage that the Opal mitigates can be quickly found with &lt;math&gt;Opals/(Opals+1)&lt;/math&gt;. One Opal reduces damage by 50%, two by 66.66%, so on and so forth. This value differs slightly depending on the character's base armor, however.
*Because armor stacks hyperbolically, having more than a few Opals quickly becomes redundant; for instance, having 5 Opals gives 83.33% damage reduction, while having 6 gives 85.71% damage reduction.

==Notes==
* If a hit is negated by {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} or {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}}, the Opal Armor buff is not lost.
*Damage taken from the [[Shrine of Blood]] or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX|altText=REX's}} "plant" skills that consume health will also cause the Opal Armor buff to be lost. These damage sources are also not reduced by armor, so the Opal will not decrease the costs.

==Tips ==
*This item pairs exceptionally well with Safer Spaces, allowing the player to completely negate 1 incoming hit and then greatly mitigate another.

The '''Old Guillotine''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The holder will instantly kill any [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] enemy that falls below 13% ''(+13% per stack)'' of its maximum health.

== Notes ==
* In a similar fashion to {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Cast Nano-Spear|survivorName=Artificer}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Snapfreeze|survivorName=Artificer}}, an enemy is executed when its health is below the threshold and the Guillotine's holder deals damage to it.
** Only the holder can execute an enemy; allies will not benefit from the holder's Guillotines.
*Enemies cannot be executed (by freezing or the Guillotine) if they have any [[Health#Shield|shields]]. Therefore,  {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} Elites effectively have a maximum execution threshold of 50% health.
**However, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}} Elites can be executed as normal at the appropriate threshold.
*This item can be particularly useful for {{SurvivorLink|Acrid|Acrid}} if using {{SkillLink|skillName=Poison|Poison}}, as it will allow the usually non-lethal passive to kill elite enemies the moment they fall below the threshold.
*The Old Guillotine is one of the few items in the game with [[Item Stacking#Hyperbolic Stacking|hyperbolic stacking]].
*24 Old Guillotines are required to overcome the bonus health for Tier 1 Elite enemies ({{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixRed}} ,{{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixWhite}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}}), and 131 are needed to overcome the health bonus of Tier 2 Elites ({{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixHaunted}}).
*{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} elites are affected by this item.
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor}} can infest and make a high health, previously non-elite enemy easier to kill as a result.
*[[Survivors]], and by extension {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|Umbra}} of Survivors, are unable to be executed.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret}} are able to be executed if they are elite.
**The execution threshold visual will still increase.
*It would take 10^34 Old Guillotines in order to have an around 100% threshold

== Math ==
The threshold at which it will activate is determined by the formula: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{0.13x + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where x is the amount

==Trivia==
*The Old Guillotine may be a reference to [[Ror:The Ol' Lopper|The Ol' Lopper]] from Risk of Rain 1. Both items are "old," have a strong execution motif, and give the player an extreme benefit against low-health enemies: the Lopper causes the player to land guaranteed critical strikes against weakened enemies, while the Guillotine will instantly kill those enemies if they are Elite.
*The Old Guillotine was the first item to have undergone a rarity change. It was originally added as a '''{{Color|#FFFFFF|Common}}''' item before later being changed into an '''{{Color|#00FF66|Uncommon}}''' item.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When the holder falls below 25% of their max HP, they become {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cloak|altText=invisible}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=CloakSpeed|altText=gain 40%}} [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] for 5 seconds. This stealth mode has a cooldown of 30 seconds (''-50% per stack)''.

== Notes ==
* This item is useful when using the {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}}, as the holder must avoid damage for 7 seconds to recover their shields. The Stealthkit's invisibility and bonus movement speed greatly aid in a retreat after sustaining heavy damage. 
** Note that damage over time, such as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire}}, will prevent shields from regenerating until the effect has expired. Be aware of this when retreating.

* Due to the math behind [[Item Stacking#Exponential Stacking|Exponential Stacking]], the cooldown can never be 0s. Instead, the remaining cooldown will be halved for every stack. This leads to the stacking behavior being closer to [[Item Stacking#Reciprocal Stacking|Reciprocal Stacking]].

* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Genesis Loop}} pairs extremely well with the Stealthkit, as both items activate simultaneously and stack similarly. Use the Genesis Loop's explosion to clear out nearby enemies and use the Stealthkit to find a more advantageous position.

* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Smoke Bomb|survivorName=Bandit}} invisibility and movement speed buffs are timed separately from the Stealthkit's buffs. If the Stealthkit is active, using Smoke Bomb will ''not'' increase the duration of invisibility or bonus movement speed. 

* Having {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch|Delicate Watches}} with an Old War Stealthkit can make it very difficult to utilize, as the Delicate Watches will break when Old War Stealthkit activates.
**Conversely, having a {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}} with an Old War Stealthkit can be fairly useful, as you will both turn invisible and heal at the same time.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Anniversary Update]]
* Gameplay Changes
** Now activates when falling to low health, rather than as a chance when hurt
** Stealth Duration: 3s (+1.5s per stack) ⇒ 5s
** Stealth Cooldown: 0s ⇒ 30s (-50% per stack)
}}

== Trivia ==
* Before the [[Anniversary Update]], the chance to activate was based on the percentage of max health and max shield the damage dealt, &lt;code&gt;1% damage = 1% chance to activate&lt;/code&gt;. This chance was calculated after all damage reductions from [[Armor]] and other sources had taken effect. The chance was affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Magma Worm#Elite Version|returning]] [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] in Risk of Rain 2. Being a Boss, the Overloading Worm may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] or normally after progressing far enough in the difficulty.

The Overloading Worm is a ''considerably'' stronger variant of the standard {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}}, boasting 5 times as much health and dealing 5 times as much damage. The Overloading Worm is ''not'' considered an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] version of the Magma Worm, but instead a unique monster. As a result, [[items]] that specifically interact with Elite monsters will be ineffective against it, and [[challenges]] pertaining to Elite monsters cannot be completed by defeating it. Due to its high cost to spawn (5 times as much as a Magma Worm), it is the rarest monster in the game, and requires a very high [[difficulty]] level for it to spawn at all.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
The Overloading Worm's skills and attack patterns are exactly the same as the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Magma Worm|altText=Magma Worm's|altUrl=Magma Worm#Skills &amp; Behavior}}. The only difference is that the screen turns bright blue instead of orange, and in the '''leaping stance''' the fireballs are electric orbs which upon impact spawn a secondary projectile that when lands also deals damage in a blast radius of 2m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|no falloff]].

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Charged Perforator]]''

If the Overloading Worm is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Overloading Worm) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}}.

== Tips ==
* Fighting an Overloading Worm is generally the same as fighting a Magma Worm. To that end, it is best to fight Overloading Worms in large open spaces.
* It is strongly advised to fight the boss from a distance. Contact damage and near-constant lightning strikes make fighting Overloading Worms a grueling task for melee [[Survivors]] like {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}. As Overloading Worms can only spawn at extremely high difficulties, players who have chosen melee Survivors should consider spending the later parts of their runs investing heavily in powerful, long-range [[items#Active Items|equipment]] to make up for their lack of range.

== Notes ==
* Overloading Worms ''can'' appear before [[Environments#Looping|looping]], but are extremely unlikely to spawn due to their [[Directors#Categories|high cost]] for [[Directors]] to spawn.
** Specifically, if reaching stage 5 on single player on [[Difficulty|Monsoon]] when at least 60 minutes have passed, the [[Directors#The Scene Director|Scene Director]] will have sufficient credits to spawn one if it is the first card it select. The chance for this is 10.41% on {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} and 23.33% on {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}}. However, this excludes the times a [[Family Events|Family Event]] and/or a [[Void Seed]] can be chosen. The Void Seed is due to the fact it takes away credits from the Director, thereby raising the time factor to have sufficient credits for the Worm.
* Despite not supporting normal [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] variants, the Overloading Worm can still bear the {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} aspect.

== Lore ==
{{Lore}}

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
; [[Anniversary Update]]
* Major Content
** Added New Lore Entry: Overloading Worm

; [[Early Access Artifacts Content Update]]
* Bug Fixes
** 🌧 Fix {{monsterLink|Magma Worm|Magma Worms}} and similar monsters from spawning as an elite version in [[Prismatic Trial]]s. Goodbye {{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue}} Overloading Worm.

; [[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update]]
* QOL
** ☂ Change post process of Overloading Worm to brighten instead of darken
}}

== Trivia ==
* 'The Reminder' is a reference to the first ''Risk of Rain'', where [[Ror:Magma Worm|Magma Worms]] could spawn as [[Ror:Elite#Overloading|Overloading Elites]]. These became infamously dangerous to the player, due to the incredibly high damage they caused.
** Magma Worms in the original game were segmented, and each piece could be interacted with individually. Though this made them easy to kill with area-of-effect attacks, it also applied to Elite prefixes, Overloading being the most dangerous. Overloading enemies in the original game would shock players in a small area around them (similar to the [[Ror:Tesla Coil|Tesla Coil]] and [[Unstable Tesla Coil|its successor]]), and since Magma Worms had multiple segments, each segment could shock individually. This would result in the player being shocked a dozen times or more in quick succession and likely killed if an Overloading Magma Worm got too close. For this reason, Overloading Magma Worms gained their reputation as the enemy that would most frequently end long runs.
* Despite being a variant of the Magma Worm, the Overloading Worm does not appear on [[Siren's Call]].

Hi!

The past few weeks we have been watching the feedback from [[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0]] and we're so excited with the reception of the update! Overall we're happy with the balance and design of the content we included, but we reduced health regen too much. This patch includes changes to health regen, a few items updates, some slight changes to Survivors, QOL updates and bug fixes.

We will be doing another Dev Thoughts in a week or two going into detail on more future content plans and console updates.

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
* Health Regeneration
**Increase Player's Health Regeneration by +66% in {{EntityLink|Rainstorm}} difficulty.
** Increase Drone Health Regeneration by +150% in ALL difficulties
***All these regeneration changes have been highly confusing and affecting difficulty too drastically – '''as a summary, {{EntityLink|Drizzle}} and {{EntityLink|Monsoon}} are the same as Skills 2.0 Release, while {{EntityLink|Rainstorm}} is now a bit easier.'''
*Items
**{{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}}
***Heal: 6 ⇒ 8
****Now that we're encouraging players to value healing items more, the healing items themselves should be a bit more decent
**{{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}}
***Now activates by holding "Use" (E key by default)
*** Improve consistency of bonus falling damage
***Now shows little lights when ready
**{{SurvivorLink|Commando}} 
***{{SkillLink|Frag Grenade|Commando}} 
****Animation Duration: 1s ⇒ 0.5s
****Can now interrupt your other abilities
**{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}
***{{SkillLink|Power-Saw|MUL-T}}
****Improve vacuum effect to pull towards enemies
**{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}
***{{SkillLink|Plasma Bolt|Artificer}} 
****Update [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]], travel speed, and fire rate to match {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt|Artificer}}
**{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} 
***{{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret|Engineer|Carbonizer Turret}}
****Walk Speed: 6 ⇒ 7
****Now scales laser tick rate with attack speed

==Quality of Life==
[[File:ROR2QualityofLife.png|400px]]
*Add details to difficulty text to show what actually changes between {{EntityLink|Drizzle}}, {{EntityLink|Rainstorm}}, and {{EntityLink|Monsoon}}.
* Update a few of our internal workings to better help modders
*Update '[[Warm For Life]]' challenge text to be more clear
*Pre-Game Lobby now properly shakes physics objects around

==Bug Fixes==
[[File:ROR2BugFixes.png|400px]] 
*Fix Quickplay matches only filling up to 3/4
*Fix {{SurvivorLink|Loader|Loader's}} "[[Loader: Swing By|Swing By]]" challenge using 25 real-time minutes instead of the in-game timer

*Fix flying AI wandering towards the ground
*Fix the character select always showing {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} skills when restarting a run
*Fix {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider|Clay Dunestrider's}} Tarball attack not networking its position correctly
*Fix {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} buzzsaw caching attack speed and crit chance on starting the attack
*Fix {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} and {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}} sometimes missing in multiplayer
*{{MonsterLink|Lemurian|Lemurians}} no longer sprint if very far away
*Fix {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} disappearing when ragdolling
*Fix {{SurvivorLink|Loader|Loader's}} wrists spinning around during certain animations

[[File:ROR2PatchNotes.png]] &lt;br /&gt;
The goal of this quality of life + bugfix patch is to address a variety of bugs, fix a few unintended changes to Merc, and to make the final fight a bit more engaging and a bit less cheesy.

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*'''{{survivorLink|Captain}}'''
**{{survivorLink|Captain|altText=Captain’s}} {{skillLink|Orbital Supply Beacon|Captain|altText=Supply Drop}} now presses the buttons on {{EnvironmentLink|Abandoned Aqueduct}}
*'''{{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}}'''
**Now recharges equipment much faster, approximately 5x as often. We don’t expect Equipment Drones to suddenly become super strong, but there may be a few cases where it is now worthwhile.
*'''SPOILERS! Final Boss, Last Phase. SPOILERS!'''
**''Developer Notes: The goal with these changes is to make the final phase of the fight more consistent, fix a few softlock scenarios, and to remove a few cheeses. The expectation is that with these changes, the final phase (and only the final phase) will be much easier. We want this to be a fun phase, not a frustrating conclusion''
**Remove “unique” scaling on health and damage. This has a '''significant''' reduction on the way his health and damage scales over time, especially later into the run. Expect him to have less than half of the current live build, depending on time.
**Lunar Shard Attack
***Projectile Cone: 20° ⇒ 0.5°
*** Developer Notes: The intent for this change is to reduce the cone that the attacks come out of, reducing the chance you randomly get hit by a stray shot.
**Energy Ball Attack
***Damage Coefficient: 1000% ⇒ 700%
***Knockback Force: 400 ⇒ 4000%
***Projectile Radius: 3m ⇒ 2m
*** Now glows with a stronger effect to make it more visually noticeable, especially when swinging around corners
**Item Steal 
***Add immunity while channeling.
*** Can no longer use {{itemLink|Mired Urn}} and {{itemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}}. He will take them, but will be unable to use them. This is a mechanic we already have in place for a few key items ({{itemLink|Razorwire}}, {{itemLink|Tougher Times}}) that can cause softlocks or impossible scenarios.
*** Now steals items from minions, like {{EntityLink|Engineer Turret|altUrl=Engineer#TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer Turrets}}. He won’t use the items he takes from minions.
***Minions can now retrieve items for their owner.
**Add visual effect to {{itemLink|Unstable Tesla Coil|altText=Tesla Coil}} being active

The goal of this minor patch is to add Sundered Grove into the game, and fix a few bugs.

==Major Content==
[[File:ROR2MajorContent.png|400px]]
*New Stage: {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}

==Bug Fixes==
[[File:ROR2BugFixes.png|400px]]

*Updated all music tracks to be more similar to the OST version
*Updated a lot of localization strings

*Fixed [[monsters]] revived via {{itemLink|Dio's Best Friend|Dio’s Best Friend}} potentially respawning into out-of-bounds kill zones that make them miss the trigger, never die again, and potentially cause a softlock in this way if they are a boss
*Added temporary safety mechanism that forces client bodies to reinitialize into valid states if they are still in an invalid state one second after spawning
*Fixed ragdolling causing the hurtboxes of dead characters to become re-enabled (yes, the {{monsterLink|Brass Contraption|altText=brass contraption}} ragdoll + melee bug is finally dead!)

** ''Developer Notes: Power Mode is gated behind a difficult challenge, but its current iteration is a bit too insane. Players should be motivated to leave Power Mode every now-and-then, and this is a safe way to make it less powerful while still keeping it fun.''

* Updated {{SkillLink|Desperado|Bandit|Bandit: B&amp;E|Bandit: B&amp;E}} and {{SkillLink|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|Captain|Captain: Smushed|Captain: Smushed}} challenges to have a short window of leniency

&lt;big&gt;!FINAL STAGE SPOILERS! !SPOILERS!&lt;/big&gt;
*Update the rescue ship’s charging zone to be infinitely tall, i.e you can charge it while floating above
*Update escape portals from the final boss arena to be more portal-looking

The goal of this patch is to address bugs from the release of Survivors of the Void, alongside community-driven balance and design changes. Read up! For some context, check out our previous Dev Thoughts: https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/632360/announcements/detail/3114807061130869251

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*'''General'''
**Added Steam achievements for the DLC!
*'''[[Simulacrum]]'''
**Waves now skip if nothing has spawned for 60 seconds
**Waves now have a limit of how many credits can be given out at once
**Waves will now spawn slightly more [[Monsters#Elites|elites]], and slightly less normal [[monsters]]
**{{ArtifactLink|Kin}} will always spawn monsters, even if they are considered ‘cheap’
**Developer Notes: Simulacrum has a few edge cases where the director fails to spawn monsters - and as a result, the gamemode no longer advances. We added a few different checks to address situations where the game gets stuck. Not only that, but simulacrum tended to spam a lot more normal monsters instead of elites - so now, it’ll spawn a little bit more elite-y.
*'''[[Void Seed]]s'''
** Void Seeds no longer spawn monsters over time, or when the Teleporter starts
**Void Seeds no longer occasionally spawns normal, non-{{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} monsters
**Void Seeds now have a more clear area indicator
**Void Seeds no longer spawn ‘naked’ {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}}
**Void Seeds now scale a lot slower over the duration of the run
**Void Seeds now spawn elite affixes (like {{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue|Overloading|Monsters#Overloading}} and {{StatusEffectLink|AffixEarth|Mending|Monsters#Mending}}) less frequently for its Void monsters
**🌧 Void Seeds now spawn Void Caches with {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice|Sacrifice}} enabled
**🌧 Void Seeds now mark remaining enemies on the map if there are 3 or less
**Developer Notes: Void Seeds are chaotic and strange by design - but that same chaos and strangeness can lead to a bit of frustration in what the heck is going on. We’ve clarified behavior, and fixed some weird edge-case scenarios that led to it being more confusing. We’re still taking a look at trying to reduce the frequency of it spawning right on top of you at stage start.
*'''[[Void Portal]]'''
**Minimum Stage Count: 3 ⇒ 6
** Developer Notes: It’s pretty much impossible to beat {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}} at stage 3, so it was just bait. Now it only spawns when a player could reasonably beat the objectives.
*'''[[Prismatic Trial]]s (Live with SotV release)'''
**Prismatic Trials now has Survivors of the Void permanently enabled, even for non-DLC owners
*'''[[Eclipse]] (Live with SotV release)'''
**Eclipse is now available in multiplayer
*'''Ignite (Live with SotV release)''' 
**{{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|Ignite}} effects, like {{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed|Blazing Elite|Monsters#Blazing}} elites and {{SurvivorLink|Artificer|Artificer’s}} {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt|artificer}}, now deal 50% of its damage over time as ignite
**Developer Notes: Previously, ignite damage was calculated off of a weird version of base damage, which was inconsistent across enemies. Not only that, but Artificer’s ignite was handled quite differently than the Blazing elites. Now, ignite effects always deal half the damage of the impact - which makes it match Overloading elite damage as well.
*'''Void Fog (Live with SotV release)'''
**{{StatusEffectLink|VoidFog|Void fog}} damage now ignores [[armor]], {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate|Armor Plating}}, and {{ItemLink|Planula}}
**Void fog damage now slowly ramps up over time as long as you remain in the fog
**Developer Notes: The Void Fog is important for a lot of content, especially in SotV - and has to remain threatening for the events to work. We found that Tougher Times, Armor Plating, and Planula made some of this content arbitrarily too easy. We also wanted to avoid being able to go ‘infinite’ in the fog with a lot of healing-over-time, so now it ramps up slowly.
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}''' 
**🌧 {{SkillLink|Flamethrower|Artificer|‘Flamethrower’}} now scales the number of damage ticks with attack speed
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}}''' 
** 🌧 {{SkillLink|Corrupted Drown|Void Fiend|‘Drown (Corrupted)’}} now scales the number of damage ticks with attack speed
**🌧 {{SkillLink|Corrupted Suppress|Void Fiend|‘Suppress (Corrupted)’}} no longer marks you as the attacker for its self-damage - meaning it won’t proc items on yourself like {{ItemLink|Crowbar}}, etc.
** 🌧 Transitioning into Corrupted mode now grants 0.5 seconds of invincibility
*'''{{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}'''  
**🌧 Percent Health Damage: 5% per second ⇒ 2.5% per second
**Developer Notes: We wanted to make Void Fields more oppressive in SotV, as a mobility/heal check before you can access the guaranteed portal into the Planetarium. It was too much, so we are reducing it.
*'''[[Environments|Stages]]''' 
**{{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium|Planetarium}} music now advances every phase
*'''{{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}}'''
**🌧 Void Infestors now slowly decay health over 30 seconds
**🌧 Void Infestors no longer can convert ‘mechanical’ targets, like Drones or Engineer Turrets
** Developer Notes: While it was cool the first time, having Void Infestors instantly kill your hard-earned drones made drones even worse. Now, they’re a decent ally to help pick off those bugs. Not only that, but an infestor that’s stuck running around the edge of a map would prevent you from finishing the Void Seed, which was annoying - now they slowly lose health over time.
*'''Items'''
**{{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}} no longer grants Col. Droneman to {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} Turrets

==Bug Fixes ==

*🌧 Fixed {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank|Ignition Tank’s}} descriptions being inaccurate to its behavior

*🌧 Fixed Simulacrum’s {{ArtifactLink|Enigma|Enigma}} wave having the wrong strings
*🌧 Fixed {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}} not having its boss item assigned, causing it to not drop or be targetable by {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}}
*🌧 Fixed {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}} not consuming {{ItemLink|Defense Nucleus}}
*🌧 Fixed a stray jump pad in {{EnvironmentLink|Sulfur Pools}} that leads nowhere
*🌧 Fixed ‘crusty’ pixels around buff icons
*🌧 Fixed {{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}} having less interactable credits than {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}, causing it to spawn less interactables
*🌧 Fixed {{ItemLink|Rusted Key}} always granting a red item
*Fixed consecutive weak point tracking resetting whenever ANY player missed, not just the player trying to earn [[Railgunner: Marksman|the achievement]]
*Fixed {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp|Will-o-the-wisp}}/{{ItemLink|Voidsent Flame}} having reversed damage coefficients
*Fixed Prismatic Trials being playable in multiplayer by starting a singleplayer prismatic trial, backing out, and then hosting a multiplayer game
*Fixed cans not animating properly with Remote Caffeinator
*Fixed Snowy, Natural, and Sandy Golem skins not being fully implemented

[[File:ROR2PatchNotes.png]] &lt;br /&gt;
The goal of this patch is to address lower-level bugs, while also taking a look at some content changes and more long-standing bugs that have existed in RoR2.

Read up!

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*'''[[Simulacrum]]'''
**Slightly updated visuals of Void Focus
**Now has an indicator for the Void Focus’ position
*'''[[Void Seed]]s'''
**🌧 Now cap at a maximum of 3 per map
**🌧 Spawn less frequently with {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice|Artifact of Sacrifice}} enabled
**🌧 Spawn less frequently on top of you when starting a new stage
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}}'''
**🌧 Corrupted skills are now lower priority than Heresy items, allowing Heresy items to override both versions of skills
*'''{{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}}'''
**🌧 Damage Bonus: +70% ⇒+200%
**🌧 Health Bonus: +70% ⇒ +200%
**🌧 Fix description in logbook being wrong
**Developer Notes: Goobo was designed to be +600%. It was +70%. +600% was actually waaay too strong when we fixed it, so we set it to a more reasonable value.
*'''{{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}'''
** 🌧 No longer grants gold to the enemy who hits you while wearing the item (but still shows the visuals)
**Developer Notes: We thought it would be a cute behavior if when losing money from Brittle Crown, it granted that money to the attacker - for use in stuff like a {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}}’s {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder|Crowd Funder}}. However, this resulted in you gaining all the money back when you killed the enemy, making Brittle Crown have (essentially) no downside.
*'''{{ItemLink|Ben's Raincoat}}'''
**Rework behavior - Now has an internal cooldown of 5 seconds
**Now blocks 1 (+1 per stack) debuffs before going on cooldown
**Now grants 10% of your health as barrier when blocking a debuff
**Now has the ‘Healing’ tag
**No longer grants maximum health
**🌧 No longer blocks non-timed debuffs, like Eclipse 8 and skills like Power Mode
**Developer Notes: Ben’s Raincoat was a very binary item, resulting in unsatisfying stacking behavior and frustrations when given to monsters (like in Simulacrum). The item also trivialized Eclipse 8. Now, it has a bit of downtime for when it can block debuffs - and since we didn’t want this to be just a net nerf, we also added a large barrier when blocking a debuff with the coat.
*'''{{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}}'''
**Max Health: 2100 (+630 per level) ⇒ 2800 (+840 per level)
**Armor: 10 ⇒ 20
**Developer Notes: Despite being a boss monster, the Void Devastator had strangely low stats for its cost, especially when compared to same-cost monsters like the Imp Overlord
*'''{{MonsterLink|Gup}}'''
**🌧 No longer splits if killed from a ‘Void Death’, like from {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses|Lost Seer’s Lenses}}
**{{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid|Voidtouched|Monsters#Voidtouched}} Gups and Geeps will now split into Voidtouched Geeps and Gips (respectively)

The goal of this patch is to address lower-level bugs, while also taking a look at some content changes and more long-standing bugs that have existed in RoR2.  In addition to that, you can now sign up for our
mailing list in game to stay updated on our latest announcements! (Steam version only)

Read up!

==Gameplay Changes ==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]]
*'''General'''
**'''[[Void Fields]]'''
*** 🌧 [[Interactables]] now spawn in the stage
***Developer Notes:  With SotV, we wanted to make the Void Fields a more compelling choice by increasing the value of the reward and introducing a cost (time).  However, we felt that the risk outweighed the reward, so we’ve added interactables to the stage, much like the interactables in Simulacrum stages.

*'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}'''
**🌧 {{SkillLink|Flame Bolt}} damage: 220% ⇒ 280%
**{{SkillLink|Plasma Bolt}} damage: 220% ⇒ 280%
**Developer Notes:  As we iterated on the way that burns work during development of SotV, we unintentionally reduced the damage of Artificer’s Flame Bolt indirectly by reducing the burn damage.  To compensate, we’re buffing the initial damage of Flame Bolt so that the overall damage returns to pre-SotV levels.  Plasma Bolt is receiving the same buff to ensure it doesn’t fall behind.

*'''{{SurvivorLink|Captain}}'''
**🌧 {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} now increases the stocks of Captain’s first beacon
**Captain is now limited to 2 deployed beacons at a time
**Developer Notes:  It was kind of lame that Lysate Cell did absolutely nothing for Captain, but it was hard to find a solution that wasn’t completely game-breaking.  Limiting the beacons to 2 at a time keeps the power of the item under control (as well as fixes some exploits in Simulacrum multiplayer). 

*'''{{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}}'''
**🌧 Fresh new skins to help differentiate allies from enemies

*'''{{ItemLink|Defense Nucleus}}'''
**Alpha Construct Ally Damage Bonus: +0% ⇒+300%
**Alpha Construct Ally Health Bonus: +0% ⇒ +300%
**Developer Notes: During development, we experimented with what conditions would trigger this item.  Initially, this item was exceptionally strong due to how frequently it triggered.  It proved to be too strong, so we changed the trigger, but we forgot to compensate by buffing the spawned Alpha Construct as we had intended.

*'''{{ItemLink|Squid Polyp}}'''
**Squid Turret Ally Base Damage: 20 ⇒ 4
**Squid Turret Ally Primary Skill Damage Coefficient: 1 ⇒ 5
**Squid Turret Allies Primary Skill Proc Coefficient:  1 ⇒ 0.1
**Squid Turret Allies Primary Skill Knockback Force:  0 ⇒ 2000
** Squid Turret Allies can now be stunned by “stunning” skills
**Squid Turret Allies can now be frozen
**Developer Notes: An important part of the balance of the Void Cradles is the risk from the Void Infestors it spawns, so we wanted to lower the risk with Squid Polyp without completely removing it.  These changes to Squid Polyp are overall a slight buff in the hands of the player (the knockback especially defends the turrets against infestation), but they mainly reduce the damage from Collapse when Voidtouched.  And believe it or not, they’re actually pretty good at killing the Void Infestors.

*'''{{MonsterLink|Blind Vermin}}''' 
**🌧 Director Credits for default variant:  20 ⇒ 14
**🌧 Director Credits for snowy variant:  8 ⇒ 14
**Developer Notes: The difference in Director Credits between the variants of Blind Vermin was unintentional, so we just split the difference.

==Quality of Life==
[[File:ROR2QualityofLife.png|400px]] 
* 🌧 Swapping between skills on cooldown no longer resets the timer to max
*🌧 Improved some exception handling for modders
*🌧 Fixing a bug for modders where stages wouldn’t spawn monsters properly unless the deprecated DirectorCardCategorySelection field was assigned

== Bug Fixes==
[[File:ROR2BugFixes.png|400px]]
*🌧 Fixed nodes in {{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Wetland Aspect}}, and [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] ’s {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}

*🌧 Fixed {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}’s {{SkillLink|M551 Pylon}} traveling different distances depending on whether the player is a host or a client

==Known Issues==
[[File:ROR2KnownIssues.png|400px]]

This patch introduces a bug whereby playing a singleplayer game after a multiplayer game will cause the difficulty and prices to remain at multiplayer levels.  As a temporary fix simply restart the game - we will have a permanent solution in place for the next patch!

Enjoy the increased difficulty while you can, challenge hunters!

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Parent|returning]] ogre-like, sprite/spirit [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''Artifacts'' Update, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Parent}} monster family.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills and Behavior==
The Parent is a monster native to Sky Meadow. While unprovoked, it slowly lumbers around along with its fellow monsters. Upon death, it will stop in place and fall forward, disintegrating into ash.

===Primary: Seismic Smash===
The Parent attacks by slamming the ground with its two fists, dealing 400% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 10m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear falloff]]. This can also knock players back depending on their positioning from the center of the blast.

This skill has a cooldown of 2 seconds. The animation duration is 3 seconds, which scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

If the Parent is airborne this skill cannot be used.

===Utility: Teleport===
The Parent can teleport to instantly travel a moderate distance, similarly to{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Imp|altText=Imps}}. However, unlike Imps, a Parent only teleports once it has spotted a player, and the Parent can't store multiple charges. The blink look-ahead distance is 30m. 

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Parent must be within 18m from its target.
# '''Use utility''': the Parent must be within 20-200m from its target and have less than 80% health.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

The goal of this patch is to address some bugs that were introduced with the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

==Gameplay Changes==
[[File:ROR2GameplayChanges.png|400px]] 
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Sonorous Whispers}} had an issue where the drop chance of items could become extremely high, especially later into runs. This has been re-balanced to be more realistic. Elite item drop chance: 15% (+5% per stack) -&gt; 4% (+1% per stack). Logbook change is still pending.

==Bug Fixes ==
[[File:ROR2BugFixes.png|400px]]
*Resolved a bug with the way builds are compiled that led to many behaviors being erroneously tied to FPS. These elements included physics, attack speed, and movement. This was not the result of any significant architecture changes to the game. The bug that created this issue has been addressed.
* Addressed an issue some players reported where {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} would become invincible upon stealing your {{ItemLink|Warped Echo}}.
*The [[Teleporter]] will no longer spawn inside geometry on {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}.
*{{SurvivorLink|Acrid|Acrid's}} Utility Skills, both {{SkillLink|Caustic Leap}} &amp; {{SkillLink|Frenzied Leap}} were not dealing damage or colliding properly. Acrid should now be back in action.
*Resolved an issue reported by some users with items not being picked up when interacted with. Despite not being picked up, some players would receive a large number of item stacks anyway. Both parts of this issue are now resolved.
*Item highlights have now returned to [[Chests#Multishop Terminal|various shops]] &amp; [[Chests#Adaptive Chest|adaptive chests]].
*You’ll now no longer be able to escape {{EnvironmentLink|Shattered Abodes}}, at least in the ways we didn't intend.
*We've restored the full screen damage indicator and low health feedback.
*An issue that caused some players to get stuck while smelling the flowers on {{EnvironmentLink|Reformed Altar}} has been resolved.
*{{ItemLink|Longstanding Solitude}} will no longer sometimes show pinged interactables at 2x cost.
*The portal will no longer spawn inside geometry in {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Bulwark's Ambry}}.
* Healthbars were updating very slowly. That has now been resolved.
*{{MonsterLink|Halcyonite|Halcyonite's}} spawn animation was playing at lower than expected framerates. He won’t be jittery anymore when spawning in.
**We’ve resolved a bug with {{SurvivorLink|Seeker|Seeker's}} {{SkillLink|Sojourn}} ability that sometimes blocked non-host players from using it.
*Players are now able to pick up {{SurvivorLink|CHEF|CHEF’s}} food drops from farther away.
*We’ve rolled out a change to the Halcyon Beacon’s texture on {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}. The team is going to continue monitoring this one. There may be more changes coming on this front.
*{{SurvivorLink|Loader|Loader's}} {{SkillLink|Knuckleboom}} VFX has been realigned.
*We’ve resolved an issue some players reported that Survivor VFX in the character select screen overlapped with the Ready button.
*Fixed an issue with {{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern}} where the logbook ‘unlock’ highlighting no longer was clearing after viewing the unlock.
* Solved an issue where the ‘item count’ displayed on the tab menu in multiplayer sessions would show 1 for some players despite not having any items.
*Resolved an issue where {{SkillLink|Sojourn}} would sometimes fail to trigger when colliding with monsters or geometry.
*Changed the visual effects of the initial jump pads on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian|Meridian}} to convey better to players from a distance.
*Resolved an issue that led to the {{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord|Imp Overlord’s}} Void Spike ability sometimes not dealing damage.
*Addressed an issue reported by some players on Prime Meridian where lighting would spawn on top of players during the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|False Son}} cutscene.
*Resolved an issue where the {{MonsterLink|Scorch Worm|Scorch Wurm}} would snap 90 degrees right before attacking.
*Gaining multiple {{ItemLink|Warped Echo|Warped Echos}} on {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}} led to infinite stacks of the item buff being added to the player. This has been resolved.
*Solved an issue where the music would stop if a player opened the logbook and clicked on an item during a run.
* Addressed an issue reported by some players where entering the Prime Meridian cutscene with &gt;4 players resulted in a softlock. To make it clear, &gt;4 player co-op is still not officially supported. We just wanted to address this anyway because we know many players still opt to unlock max lobby size with convars.
*[[Teleporter]]s should no longer be able to spawn within [[Halcyon Shrine|Halcyonite Shrines]]
*Resolved an issue where some players without SOTS could become soft locked by not being able to interact with the [[Shrine of Rebirth]] upon defeating False Son.
* CHEF has had some item placements moved (where items are displayed on his character model when picked up) to avoid clipping with other items and parts of his model.
* Addressed an issue with {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|Railgunner’s}} Concussion Device (utility - mine) where it would not detonate on its own. It will now detonate after a few seconds like normal.
*Resolved an issue reported by some players where sometimes skills wouldn’t activate when pressed. This ended up being a bi-product of the FPS-related issues we outlined above. Both are now resolved.
* Addressed a bug that allowed players to permanently fire {{SurvivorLink|False Son|False Son’s}} Laser of the Father ability (special – head laser). It will now go on cooldown after fired for up to 4 seconds.
*Increased the intensity of the VFX for CHEF’s Dice ability (primary – cleaver). This should make it easier to spot when thrown a far distance out.
* Addressed an issue where players would be unable to input actions for {{SurvivorLink|Seeker|Seeker’s}} Meditate ability while having both mouse/keyboard and a controller plugged in at the same time.
*Resolved an issue where sometimes Chef’s Dice (primary – cleavers) couldn’t be recalled while at either unlimited or under 30 FPS. That issue was part of the FPS-tied-mechanics issue above. Both have been solved.
* Addressed an issue where {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} was no longer able to hit enemies or spread his poison using Epidemic (special – poison blob attack)
*Solved an issue where {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}} would stop firing if framerate fell under 30FPS. This was also part of the FPS-tied-mechanics issue above. Both issues have been resolved.
*Acrid’s Frenzied Leap (utility – jump) now properly negates fall damage when falling from large heights.
* Addressed an issue where standing behind Mithrix, while entering phase 4, results in him losing aggression towards you temporarily.
*{{MonsterLink|Parent|Parents}} had an issue where they would attempt to navigate to the player but get stuck on a navigation node, that issue has now been fixed. We are tracking broadly similar behavior with some other monsters, but none were nearly as severe as Parents were.

==Known Issues==
[[File:ROR2KnownIssues.png|400px]]

We are aware of False Son's downward plunge attack not behaving as intended. We're currently working to address this issue, but did not want it to hinder the release of additional changes.

The goal of this patch is to address some bugs that were introduced with the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

==Bug Fixes==
[[File:ROR2BugFixes.png|400px]]
*When the {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} used Club of the Forsaken (Primary – swing attack) while falling, he could become locked in his ‘diving attack’ state despite colliding with the ground.
*The shader for the Halcyon Beacons in {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}} would now wrap all the way around the beacon as expected.
*Upon defeating {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} and escaping successfully, connected clients sometimes saw the final kill screen for a moment before the credits played.
*The sun over {{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}} could sometimes be a tad ‘flashier’ than usual. The sun has been restored to its previous glory.
*Quitting to the main menu immediately after hosting a four-player run could result in a soft lock.
*Upon defeating The {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|False Son}} as {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}}, the line that plays in chat was incorrect. That string has been replaced with the intended line.
*{{SurvivorLink|Loader|Loader’s}} Thunderslam (Alt Special – downward slam) and {{SurvivorLink|False Son|False Son’s}} diving Club of the Forsaken attack (Primary – swing while falling) both failed to shake the player’s screen when used.
*Sometimes changing the music audio slider would not actually change anything. We identified two potential causes and resolutions for this issue.
*In the Loadout tab of the Character Selection Screen, skins would sometimes not display their names when hovered.

==Notes==
''This skipped from V1.3.2 to V1.3.4 because V1.3.3 was just an internal build. Don’t worry, there wasn’t a version you missed.''

This update resolves another chunk of major bugs

==Hey Everyone! ==
Today we're revealing our roadmap for the overhaul of Seekers of the Storm. You can find that over here. But if you're looking for the changelog for V1.3.5, you've come to the right place.

== Bug Fixes==
[[File:ROR2BugFixes.png|400px]]
*Resolved a player reported issue that resulted in the spawn rate of [[elites]] being too high after stage 2.
*The {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|Mul-T}} {{SkinLink|Sentry}} skin has been tweaked to eliminate a small spike seen and reported by some players
*Resolved a reported issue where the {{MonsterLink|Voidling}} would not re-appear upon starting the second phase of its fight.
*{{SurvivorLink|False Son}} would have trouble using his ‘charged’ attack if your attack speed became extremely high. This has been resolved, so resume printing syringes at your leisure.
* As a connected client, some players reported that {{SurvivorLink|Seeker|Seeker’s}} {{SkillLink|Spirit Punch}} had a chance to collide twice with the enemy and deal double damage. That has now been addressed.
*As a connected client, players reported that {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|The False Son’s Boss fight}} would sometimes not show certain animations. He’s back to using those abilities properly.
*Players reported that on a certain version of {{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}, a mysterious floating tree would spawn. The tree has been returned to the ground where it belongs.
*Players reported that the lightning on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} would only ever target the Host in multiplayer sessions. The lightning will now attack everyone equally.
*Platforms for {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|The False Son’s}} arena on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} would sometimes not change for clients when moving between phases. They will now appear/disappear just as they would to the host.
*Resolved a reported issue that led to players sometimes not properly spawning in when entering cross play sessions.
*Players that use PlayStation controllers on PC reported to us that Xbox glyphs were being displayed instead. The correct glyphs will now be displayed.
* As a connected client, players reported that sometimes {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|The False Son’s}} large boss health bar would not reappear after changing phases. It will now show back up for all players.
*Resolved a reported issue with the [[Prismatic Trial]] leaderboard not displaying any times.
*Players have reported a mysterious Xi Construct creature appearing in the new Aphelian Bulwark Ambry Variant. That monster has now been removed from the monster pool.
*Addressed a reported issue where the {{ItemLink|Tonic Affliction|affliction stacks}} that {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic|Tonic}} gave you would display a place-holder description.
*Resolved an issue where - when fighting the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|The False Son Boss}} with {{ArtifactLink|Swarms|Artifact of Swarms}} - the {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} event [[Challenges|achievement]] would unlock after only killing one of the bosses.&lt;!-- How do i challenge link here? --&gt;
* Players who attempted to join lobbies reported to us that sometimes it would just not allow them to join and not tell them why. An issue has been resolved that made certain error messages not appear when joining lobbies. The most common of those was not receiving a message when a crossplay-enabled user attempted to join one without crossplay enabled.
*Resolved an issue that could sometimes trap players outside of {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|The False Son's}} {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian|boss room}} upon being {{SkillLink|Meditate|altText=resurrected}} by {{SurvivorLink|Seeker}}.
* When playing as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|Mul-T}} and using the {{SkinLink|Sentry}} skin, sometimes players would not receive the visual effect when frozen. You are once again able to turn {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|Mul-T}} into an ice cube.
*Resolved an issue players reported where applying {{StatusEffectLink|Bleed|bleed}} with {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn|Noxious Thorns&lt;sup&gt;[sic]&lt;/sup&gt;}} could make [[monsters]] turn on each other and ignore the player.
* Addressed another reported issue with {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn}} where it would not correctly apply + 1 stack of another active debuff. It had sometimes only been applying its bleed stack.
* Resolved an issue were using {{SkillLink|Sojourn}}, {{ItemLink|Eccentric Vase}}, or {{ItemLink|Volcanic Egg}} could lock you out of viewing the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|False Son}} fight into or teleporting up to the platform.
*Players reported that the {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant|Wandering Vagrant’s}} homing orbs could sometimes turn invincible. That issue should now be addressed.

==Hey Everyone! ==
Today we’re kicking off our SOTS roadmap with our first phase. Our focus for this phase is on Items and Elite Monsters. If you’re looking for the Dev Diary, you can find that over here!

==Major Changes==

===Antler Shield - Renamed to Elusive Antlers===

*'''Old Functionality''' - 55% (+5% per stack) chance on being hit to reflect 10% (+10% per stack) damage back to the attacker.
*'''New Functionality''' - Increases movement speed by 7% (+7% per stack). Spawns orbs of energy nearby every 10 seconds (-10% per stack) giving +12% movement speed up to 3 times (+1 per stack) for 12 seconds.

===Bolstering Lantern ===

*'''Old Functionality''' - When below 50% health, receive a damage increase of 20%
*'''New Functionality''' - Increase your attack speed by 10% for up to 4 (+2 per stack) enemies and allies within 20 (+5 per stack meters.)

*'''Old Functionality''' - While benefiting from 5+ unique buffs gain 20% (+20% per stack) bonus stats for 5 seconds.
*'''New Functionality''' - Grants 7% (+7% per stack) increase to ALL stats for each buff, up to a maximum of 4 (+4 per stack).

===Warped Echo===

*'''Old Functionality''' - On damage taken 50% of the damage is dealt immediately while the other 50% is delayed for 3 seconds. This effect has a cooldown of 10 seconds.
*'''New Functionality''' - The next source of damage is reduced by 30% and spread into 3 (+1 per stack) hits. All echoed damage is non-lethal except for the final hit. Recharges every 15s (-3% per stack.)

=== War Bonds===

*'''Old Functionality''' - Yields 75 gold (+25 gold per item stack) based on current difficulty level and the survivor's level at the start of every stage.
*'''New Functionality''' - During boss events, 5 missiles bombard the area, dealing 2.5% of the bosses Max Health in damage (+2.5% per stack.) Before the boss event, gain additional missiles, up to a maximum of 20 (+5 per stack) per 25 gold gained. Gold requirement scales over time.

===Runic Lens===

*'''Old Functionality''' - Overspill. 5% chance (+1% per 100% done on initial hit plus 1% per item stack) on hit to summon a meteor on the target, dealing 2000% damage.
*'''New Functionality''' - 3% chance on hit to call a meteor strike, dealing 2000% base damage. Every 100% attack damage dealt increases the activation chance by 3% (+3% per stack) and damage by 150% (+50% per stack.)

===Knockback Fin - Renamed to Breaching Fin=== 

*'''Old Functionality''' - 7.5% (+7.5% per stack) chance on hit to knock enemies into the air. (height increases per stack).
*'''New Functionality''' - Grounded enemies hit with any skill are launched and stunned. Enemies hit while airborne are launched again up to 2 times (+1 per stack.) Launched enemies take increased damage by 20% from all sources per launch. Recharges after 10s. Increased to Uncommon (green) rarity.

===Noxious Thorn===

* '''Old Functionality''' - 25% chance on being hit to inflict nearby enemies with 2 (+1 per stack) stacks of bleed. If enemies are already inflicted with one or more stackable debuffs, add 1 (+1 per stack) to those debuffs instead.
* '''Updated Functionality''' - Gain 10% chance to bleed an enemy. On killing an enemy, transfer 33% of every debuff stack to 1 enemy (+1 per stack) within 20m (+5m per stack).

===Unstable Transmitter===

*'''Old Functionality''' - When reaching below 25% health the Survivor explodes, dealing 350% (+350% per item stack) damage to nearby enemies and teleporting to a random location. This effect has a cooldown of 2 minutes (-5% per item stack).
*'''Updated Functionality''' - Falling below 25% health gives you 75% of your maximum health as a temporary barrier. Gain a dimensional aura for 8s that bleeds and teleports away enemies. Enemies killed by the aura extend the duration by 1s. Recharges every 45s (-10% per stack.)

===Luminous Shot===

*'''Old Functionality''' - Every 5 enemies slain grants a damage counter bonus increasing the players damage by 10% (+5% per item stack), lasting as long as the player stays in combat.
*'''Updated Functionality''' - Killing an enemy increases your damage by 3.5% (+1% per stack,) up to 10 (+5 per stack,) for 7s. Dealing damage refreshes the timer.

==Minor Changes==
'''Chance Doll''' - Functionality unchanged, updated the logbook entry to correctly display the 40% chance of increasing rarity of items from Shrines of Chance. When an item is successfully increased in rarity the text is now colored green in the chat log and green particles emit from the shrine.

'''Sonorous Whispers''' - reduced the item drop rate from elites to 4% but retained the guaranteed drop from large monsters.

'''Prayer Beads''' - Functionality unchanged, added text when removing the beads to better convey the buffs gained. It is also now blacklisted from Item Printers.

'''Longstanding Solitude''' - “free unlock” buff is now retained between stages. Gold cost for interactables (in multiplayer) now increased by 50% (down from being increased by 100%).

'''Seed of Life''' - Now works as expected when given to an equipment drone, and the consumed version can no longer teleport players out of bounds.

'''Electric Boomerang''' - No longer applies bleed when carrying Sawmarang equipment.

==Elite Updates==

===Twisted Elites===

*'''Old Functionality''' - Generated an aura that made all allies inside reflect damage to the player.
*'''New Functionality''' - Leashes itself to nearby enemies. When those leashed enemies take damage, this Elite begins to charge a Lunar Crystal. Once fully charged it’s unleashed and will track the player until it either hits them or impacts a surface. If a player fails to dodge that crystal, they’ll take a huge chunk of damage and become temporarily afflicted with Lunar Ruin.

===Gilded Elites=== 

*'''Old Functionality''' - Periodically steal gold from the player when attacked. Gold stolen increases the armor of the Elite.
*'''New Functionality''' - These elites attack the player with Golden Spikes that emerge from the ground after a short warning. Damage done to the player forces gold to be dropped by the player in the form of short-lived collectable Gold Nuggets.

==1.3.6 Other Changes==

*Railgunner can no longer build stacks of Luminous Shot by repeatedly using the zoom scope while holding down her primary attack.
*Blacklisted Unstable Transmitter, Breaching Fin and Sonorous Whispers from situations where enemies can obtain items (such as Simulacrum.)
*Following player reports of Railgunner’s picky fashion sense, Kjaro’s Band now correctly displays on the character model once collected.
* Updated Wetland Aspect and Distant Roost (variant) to correctly allow DLC content to appear.
*Updated Golden Dieback to now spawn the correct monster pool (distinct from Treeborn Colony.)
* Both Magma Worms and Overloading Magma Worms now have functioning weak spots when playing as Railgunner.
*Updated multiple player reported instances of floating items (such as Defense Nucleus and Frost Relic) displaying strangely on Seeker/Chef/False Son.
*Players who have collected Plasma Shrimp during gameplay will no longer have a pink health bar when being affected by Lunar Ruin on Prime Meridian.
*On Prime Meridian Lunar Ruin will no longer slow players.
*Addressed issue where a Scavenger’s Thqwib attack was being blocked by the Scavenger itself.
*Geodes no longer spawn in the air around the False Son arena on Prime Meridian.
*Removed reference to False Son’s Lunar Spikes ability slowing enemies.
* Updated a spot on Siphoned Forest where players couldn’t escape without movement boosting abilities.
*Resolved player reported issue where survivors could dash/blink through certain stage geometry on Aphelian Sanctuary.
*Players can no longer clip into a specific pillar on Reformed Altar.
*Re-introduced some map features on Commencement that went missing with the launch of Seekers of the Storm, including one of the jump pads up to the final arena (personally, I blame Mithrix). We’ll keep monitoring reports in case anyone finds anything else he may have nabbed.
* Gilded Elites now correctly appear when using the Artifact of Honor.
*Fireworks no longer collide with the Halcyon Shrine they have been activated from.
*Following player reports when playing with a controller, players are no longer forced to jump when picking an item from Scrappers, Void Potentials and Command Essences. This has been corrected on all platforms.

Hello! This is the update note page for Phase 2 of the Seekers of the Storm Roadmap (False Son Boss Fight) - for more details about this phase you can check out the Dev Diary right here!

==False Son Boss Fight==

*Improved attack, movement and transition animations across all phases of the encounter.
*Altered health, scaling and damage dealt by False Son Boss to make the encounter an appropriate challenge depending on the length of your run, including giving him [[Armor#Adaptive Armor|Adaptive Armor]] similar to the other end game bosses.
*Improved telegraphing of all attacks during the fight to reduce unexpected deaths.
*Improved visual cues to better communicate False Son/Encounter abilities and effects.
*Improved False Son pathfinding around the arena.
*Reduced {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}} spawns during the encounter.
*Adjusted Lunar Pillar cover in the arena.

==Void Fields==

We have made some changes to the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, such as increasing the challenge to better balance the massive boost in player-power this hidden realm represents, and also to reduce the viability of tactics that take advantage of infinitely spawning monsters while time is frozen.

*While a Void Cell is active, time stops while you are inside the safe zone, however time resumes when any player is outside taking damage from the [[Void Fog]]. Time remains paused while you are moving from cell-to-cell between rounds.
*Void Fog damage now very slowly ramps-up over time preventing excessive time chillin’ in the Void. It is a much slower increase than other versions of Void Fog (such as [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simualcrum]]) giving you ample time moving from cell-to-cell between rounds.
*Items are now added to the monster item pool sooner if players are taking an excessive amount of time to complete a Void Cell.

==Item Changes==
Based on community feedback since the previous Seekers of the Storm item update (thank you to everyone who completed the survey and gave us feedback in Discord) we have made some balance changes to the items introduced with the DLC.

*{{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} can now only be activated once per stage and barrier gain has been reduced to 35% of maximum health (was 75%.) Item regenerates at the start of each stage. [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|One Shot Protection]] removed.
*Rebalanced [[Gold]] to XP ratio of {{ItemLink|Longstanding Solitude}}.
*The base speed benefit of {{ItemLink|Elusive Antlers}} has been removed. You can now only gain speed by collecting the orb drops.
*{{ItemLink|Growth Nectar}} now grants 4% increase to all stats (down from 7%) for each buff, up to a maximum of 4 (+4 per stack.) No longer increases base stat increase with additional stacks.
*{{ItemLink|Warped Echo}} first-hit damage reduction lowered to 20% (was 30%.) Delayed damage ticks can now benefit from items such as {{ItemLink|Planula}} and {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} (and others!)
*{{ItemLink|War Bonds|Warbonds}} proc chance reduced to 0 (was 1) and increased base cost of additional missiles from 25 to 50 gold.
*Base damage increase of {{ItemLink|Breaching Fin}} reduced to 10% (was 20%) however each additional juggle increases damage by 10% (with a single item the total bonus is 30% with a fully-juggled enemy, gaining further stacks of Breaching Fin gives you an extra juggle and a further +10% damage for each additional juggle.)
*Attack speed bonus of {{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern}} has been reduced from 10% to 7.5% per enemy within 20 meters.
*Loot chance from {{ItemLink|Sonorous Whispers}} has been rebalanced to favour white items.
*Reduced the audio volume of the {{ItemLink|Chronic Expansion}} beeps when the effect is due to fall-off.

==Enemy Changes==

*Revised {{MonsterLink|Halcyonite}} Whirlwind attack to address odd pursuit behavior.
*Improved Halcyonite hitbox to better match the visuals.
*All 3 blasts of Halcyonite’s tri-laser now track the player.
*{{MonsterLink|Scorch Worm}} HP has been reduced.
*Running over a buried Scorch Worm should now be more consistent in forcing them to come above ground.

==Other Changes==
*Added an alternate way to enter the Path of the Colossus.
*If you choose to continue your run after {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} the stage count will no longer increment, for example if you enter the Path of the Colossus on stage 1, when you complete Prime Meridian you will enter a stage 4 variant (previously you would always be taken to {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}}.)

==Known Issues==
*Completing the Void Fields will once again increment the stage counter - this is unintended and will be reverted in a future update.

==Bug Fixes==
*Holding {{ItemLink|Sawmerang}} equipment will no longer apply bleed when using {{ItemLink|Electric Boomerang}} (for real this time!!)
*Removed several instances where debug text would appear in place of the intended text.
*{{StatusEffectLink|Burn}} debuff no longer removes other DoT debuffs when it expires.
*Debuffs will now correctly trigger the {{ItemLink|Death Mark}} effect when being transferred between enemies via {{ItemLink|Noxious Thorn}}.
*The Bazaar shopkeeper has found their voice once again.
*{{ItemLink|Eccentric Vase|Eccentric Vase’s}} Tunnel no longer collides with the visual indicator of {{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern}}.
*{{ItemLink|War Bonds|Warbonds}} is now blacklisted from the {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} item pool.
*Enemies introduced in SotS can now appear on stages when using {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}}.
*{{EnvironmentLink|Verdant Falls}} should now correctly be accessible when looping with SotS disabled.
*Fixed issue where a client leaving and rejoining a multiplayer run after charging the TP with the {{ArtifactLink|Delusion}} enabled would cause all reset chests to no longer be functional.
*Environment Logs are now correctly considered in the “Collectables” line of the Profile Stats page.
*Fixed multiple issues during split-screen play on next-gen consoles concerning permissions when the game is paused.
*Fixed a couple of spots where the player could clip through terrain on {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} and {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Siren's Call}}.
*{{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} will now display their walk animation correctly when using a controller and only very slightly moving the stick.

*{{ItemLink|Bolstering Lantern|Bolstering Lantern’s}} scaling is now more focused on the item's utility rather than increasing its effective range. It now grants 10% (+ 3.5% per stack) attack speed (up from a flat 7.5%). That effect is granted per Monster or Ally in a 20 meter range up to 3 (+ 1 per stack). The range no longer scales with additional Lanterns.
*{{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} now grants 60% [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] on activation (up from 35%). It has also had its internal cooldown changed from 45 seconds to 1.1 seconds, for those of you that choose to hoard several Transmitters at a time.

==Known Issues==
*Sometimes one or both logos will not appear during the splash screen 'boot-up'. This has a planned fix in an upcoming update.

==Bug Fixes==
*Players who have completed the “CHEF’s Wok” recipe but never received the [[Order Up!]] achievement (and were therefore unable to unlock CHEF) will now be able to complete the achievement.&lt;br&gt;'''''Developer note:''''' If you are a player that completed the CHEF’s Wok’s recipe but never received Chef’s “Order Up” achievement, then just booting the game after this update and reaching the main menu should grant you the achievement. If you are an Xbox user and don’t get the achievement upon reaching the main menu when unlocking CHEF moving forward, this might be related to missing save data. The solution for this is just to start a run with any survivor and that should grant the “Order Up” achievement". We are going to continue looking out for any save related issues so keep the reports coming.
*Issue with missing music and sound when many other sounds are playing (primarily on Nintendo Switch) should now be resolved - Many other smaller scale audio issues should also now be resolved across all platforms.
*The {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|False Son}} Colossus laser damage ramp-up no longer carries over between runs.
*When playing as CHEF in multiplayer, other players will no longer see or hear you charge Boosted Roll after the ability should have ended.
*Carried Warbanner will no longer clip through {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain’s}} model.
*{{SurvivorLink|Mercenary|Mercenary’s}} swing/slash animation will now properly play when performing a primary attack just after performing {{SkillLink|Blinding Assault}}.
*Missing healing orbs from {{ItemLink|Monster Tooth}} should now appear again on console.
*Model/Environment wireframe should no longer be visible when the camera is dipped below water on PS4.
*Stage will correctly lose saturation when {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)}} uses Prime Devastator on Xbox.
*Dying as {{SurvivorLink|Seeker}} during {{SkillLink|Meditate}} will now correctly allow you to spectate other players in multiplayer.
*Leaves on {{EnvironmentLink|Treeborn Colony}} have had correct collisions added to prevent players getting stuck.
*Multiple small out-of-bounds gaps which could lead to players falling through the map have been patched up.
*Removed/Replaced several instances of incorrect dev-text being visible to players.
*Gaining {{StatusEffectLink|Twisted}} Elite effect via {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}} should now function correctly as a player.
*{{ItemLink|War Bonds}} now correctly triggers when encountering {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} within the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].
*Mithrix will correctly drop a red-tier item when defeated in Simulacrum while holding Sonorous Whispers.
*{{ItemLink|Chance Doll}} can no longer drop when using {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} (as no Chance Shrines spawn.)
*Character shadows no longer cause visual issues with the Ready button on the Survivor select screen.
*{{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} can no longer charge &amp; trigger {{ItemLink|Luminous Shot}} from its Alt Primary during {{SkillLink|Power Mode}} (it now only charges Luminous Shot.)
*CHEF’s {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}} clones are now considered mechanical and are thus immune to {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|altText=Void Infestors}} (but now benefit from {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}}!)
*When {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} is boosted into the air with {{ItemLink|Breaching Fin}} Fin he will now correctly display the visual indicators of his Forbidden Pizza attack. Yes, that is the official name.&lt;br&gt;''Developer Note: No, it isn't.&lt;br&gt;Community Manager Note: Yes, it is.''
*Fixed issue where {{SurvivorLink|False Son}} (Survivor) {{SkillLink|Laser Burst}} would not do damage in multiplayer.
*Fixed visual issue with Seeker’s barrier when benefiting from the {{ItemLink|Warped Echo}} effect.
*Players will no longer retain a charge of {{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} if revived after being killed during the active-effect.
*In multiplayer clients will correctly have their equipment disabled during the False Son Boss Fight when affected by Prime Devastator.
*Fixed multiplayer Prime Devastator issue where players could have locked equipment remain locked if revived during the fight.
*War Bond’s model in the logbook has grown out of its emo phase and decided to remove its black make-up.
*Seeker’s Sojourn will no longer consume all charges when used while benefiting from {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}.
*False Son Boss’s hitbox has been extended below the knees. Rejoice, short kings!

'''Paul's Goat Hoof''' is a [[Ror:Paul's Goat Hoof|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.  

The item increases the player's base [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] by 14% ''(+14% per stack)''.   

== Notes ==
* This speed bonus is calculated before any other speed bonus in the game; speed gained from {{ItemLink|Warbanner}}, {{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron}}, and other speed-boosting items is added on top of the speed from the amount of goat hooves in the player's inventory.
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}, however, multiplies final movement speed, thereby enhancing all speed-boosting items.
* When compared to the {{ItemLink|itemName=Energy Drink}} while sprinting, the hoof provides a 20.3% increase in speed, while the energy drink's is of 25%. Keep in mind that while the hoof is active at all times, the drink is only of use if the character is sprinting, this also means energy drinks are of no use to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss}} on the last phase.

'''Pause.''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by freeing the [[Bazaar Between Time#Survivor Suspended in Time|survivor suspended in time]] for {{LunarCoin|10}}.

To complete this challenge, collect at least {{LunarCoin|11}} and find a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]]. Pay one coin to the Altar so the Blue Portal spawns upon fully charging the Teleporter. Use the Blue Portal instead of the Teleporter and head to the Bazaar. To the right of the {{EntityLink|Newt}} is {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}, trapped inside a crystal. Pay {{LunarCoin|10}} and the challenge is completed, unlocking her.

In a multiplayer game, if any player has not unlocked Artificer yet, the crystal with her trapped inside will appear for ''all'' players. However, only the player that pays lunar coins will unlock Artificer. Any player who has already unlocked her can pay {{LunarCoin|10}}, but it will not unlock Artificer for any other players and waste the coins.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|yellow item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

It can only be obtained from a [[Cleansing Pool]] in exchange for a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]], and increases the holder's maximum health by 10% (''+10% per stack'').

The Pearl has a drop chance of 80%. Its rare counterpart is the {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl}}, which increases all other stats in addition to maximum health.

== Notes ==
* The {{ItemLink|Recycler}} cannot be used to transform other boss items into a Pearl, or vice versa.
* Pearls cannot be obtained while the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is active. Cleansing Pools do not spawn, and neither the Pearl or the Irradiant Pearl can be selected from Yellow Command Essences.
* While Pearls can be scrapped with a [[Scrapper]] for {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Yellow|altText=Yellow Item Scraps}} and are the same rarity as other boss items, Yellow Scrap cannot be used with the Cleansing Pool, and Pearls will never be offered by an [[3D Printers#Overgrown 3D Printer|Overgrown 3D Printer]].
* Increasing maximum health is not considered healing, so picking up a Pearl does not fail the [[Naturopath]] challenge.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item adds a passive [[Health#Shield|shield]] equal to 8% ''(+8% per stack)'' of the player's max HP on top of their health.  

== Notes ==

* Shields cannot be healed by conventional means, and will only replenish after avoiding damage for 7 seconds.
* This item is affected by the {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}. When the player's maximum health is halved, the amount of shields they gain is also reduced.
* This item can benefit a player with {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}}, since it will increase the shield by a small degree.
** Since this item's shield scales with ''base'' maximum health, adding a {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} does not change the amount of shield gained from this item.

== Tips ==
* The extra shield is particularly useful with {{ItemLink|itemName=Plasma Shrimp}}, as it can provide more reliable uptime of its effect.

'''Petrichor V''' is the primary setting of ''Risk of Rain 2'' and its predecessor, [[ror:|''Risk of Rain'']].

A mysterious, uncharted world, this planet was first set upon by humanity when the UES ''Contact Light'' was asked to go towards the planet by an [[Siren's Call|unknown individual]]. The violent sabotage and crash of the ''Contact Light'', as well as the subsequent struggle of its surviving crew, serve as the premise of ''Risk of Rain''. 

After the events of ''Risk of Rain'' come to pass, a rescue mission is called in to determine what became of the ''Contact Light''. The endeavors of the crew of the [[UES Safe Travels|UES ''Safe Travels'']] to explore the planet and search for answers serve as the premise of ''Risk of Rain 2''.

==Description==
Petrichor V is a diverse world, with a wide array of [[environments]] that includes deserts, tundras, fungal jungles, and islands floating freely in the sky. Beyond these areas, the planet also sports a hefty variety of otherworldly realms, ranging from {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths|outright hellish}} to {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields|dimensions beyond common understanding}}. It is orbited by its moon, where {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} is located.

The fauna of the planet is as equally diverse, and yet near-totally united in their violent hostility towards the crew of the ''Contact Light''. It was no sort of territorial dispute or desire to scare off the ''Contact Light''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s survivors - the monstrous denizens of the planet relentlessly pursued them. There were some who attempted to document the native life, observing peaceful and gentle creatures who would turn savagely violent upon seeing a human. The signal echoes from {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}} - the closest thing to a human settlement - describe the futility of their attempts to regroup in the wake of the planet's wrathful inhabitants. By the time the UES ''Safe Travels'' responds to the ''Contact Light''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s distress call, it is unable to find any trace of surviving humans left on the planet, and the members of the ''Safe Travels''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' crew find themselves met with the same hostility by the planet's inhabitants.

==Trivia==
* [[wikipedia:Petrichor|Petrichor]] is the name of the earthy smell produced by rain after a dry period.
* In planetary naming convention, planets are designated by the name of their star followed by the Roman numeral of their orbit's position in the star system, counted from the star outwards. Following this convention, Earth is named '''Sol III'''. Likewise, '''Petrichor V''' would be the fifth planet in the planetary system of the star Petrichor.
* 'Petrichor V' was originally a name given to the planet by fans, based on a track of the same name from the ''Risk of Rain 2'' Soundtrack. It has since been officially adopted as the canonical name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtu.be/AfG5GcGo8Nw?t=6037 Soundtrack Commentary] by Chris Christodoulou about the origin story of the name "Petrichor V".&lt;/ref&gt;
** Prior to this, the developers had used 'The Planet,' for simplicity and ease of access during discussions.

The '''Planula''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Grandparent}}.

Whenever the holder takes damage, they immediately heal 15 HP (''+15 HP per stack''), making it extremely useful against monsters that attack with rapid, low-damage hits.

== Notes ==
* Damage-over-time debuffs, fall damage and self-inflicted damage trigger the heal.
** Damage taken from [[Void Fog]], however, does not.
*Planula's healing is applied if the incoming hit does not ignore [[armor]] and ''before'' taking damage. As such it may prevent the holder from dying. However, this also means that the player will also not be at full health after the hit. ''(See [[Damage#Receiving Damage|Receiving Damage]] for more details for the order of events).''

==Tips==
*The Planula works well with the {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}} to recoup HP lost while burning.
*{{SurvivorLink|REX}} makes excellent use of the Planula, since it heals them when they pay HP for abilities.
*This item can pair well with the {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} to further mitigate damage, although both these items fall off in effectiveness as the difficulty increases.
**Both of these item can prove to be a hindrance when fighting {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=Mithrix's}} final phase where the player's power is reset before reclaiming their items back. However, this mostly applies to weak, fast-hitting attacks, such as {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Auto-Nailgun}}.

==Trivia==
*Inside the egg, a tiny{{MonsterLink|Parent}} can be seen.

* While written to sound humorously confusing, this item's logbook entry suggests that the Parent species has a similar life cycle to that of stars; they start out normal-sized, expand into giants over time, and then collapse into smaller versions, which are the oldest. This may also explain why the species glows brightly, and why Grandparents have a "sunlight" attack.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion, and the corruption of the {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}. 

On hitting an enemy, if the player has any [[Health#Shield|shield]], they will launch a homing missile that deals 40% ''(+40% per stack)'' [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|total damage]] with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2. In addition, the first Plasma Shrimp the player acquires gives shield equal to 10% of their maximum health.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of +50% total damage per stack is incorrect. 
* Having any number of Plasma Shrimps will make the shield bar pink, instead of the normal blue color. This includes other shield sources such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Personal Shield Generator}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}}.
* Shields cannot be healed by conventional means, and will only replenish after avoiding damage for 7 seconds.
* The shield gained from the Plasma Shrimp is affected by anything that modifies the holder's maximum health, such as the {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Stone Flux Pauldron}}: when the player's maximum health is modified, the amount of shields they gain is increased or reduced by the same amount.
*The missiles fired by Plasma Shrimp act differently than every other missile in the game, rapidly homing on the target while ignoring other enemies and terrain. If the original target dies, missiles will not search for a new target.

== Tips ==
* Any damage with a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 triggers the Plasma Shrimp. This makes attacks with lower coefficients very effective, since it effectively increases the proc coefficient of them by 0.2.
** The Plasma Shrimp can be especially useful on skills that can quickly fire multiple projectiles, such as {{SurvivorLink|Bandit|Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|Burst}}, as well as skills with relatively high attack speed, such as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} {{SkillLink|Auto-Nailgun}}.
**This is notably effective with {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}, as it triggers Plasma Shrimp twice per shot- once for the initial 0.1 hit, and once for the delayed 1.0 hit.
**It's worth noting that Plasma Shrimp activates on-hit items more frequently and quickly than {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, but comes at the cost of dealing less damage from TOTAL damage items such as {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}.
* Having the {{ItemLink|itemName=Transcendence}} (or, more rarely, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}}) will turn the player's entire health bar into shields. This makes the Plasma Shrimp always active, granting a consistent increase in damage output.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Pocket I.C.B.M.}} triples the projectiles fired by the Plasma Shrimp, drastically increasing its damage and number of on-hit procs.
*Removing the luck-based element of the {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}} allows a player to use the Plasma Shrimp without being affected by the downside of {{ItemLink|itemName=Purity}}. However, if they have ''increased'' luck, the Plasma Shrimp can potentially become a damage ''loss''. 
**At one {{ItemLink|itemName=57 Leaf Clover}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}} deals more damage on average if the triggering Proc Coefficient is 0.7 or better. With two stacks of {{ItemLink|itemName=57 Leaf Clover}}, AtG Missile wins out if the triggering Proc Coefficient is as low as 0.5; any lower than this, and Shrimp Missile is still a damage increase. This doesn't take into account the additional one would gain from picking up a Plasma Shrimp to corrupt a stack of AtG missiles (i.e. 4 AtG Missiles vs. 5 Plasma shrimp).
**Plasma Shrimp and {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}  are similarly effective in Proc Coefficient chains (10% chance for 1.0, and 100% chance for 0.2), so damage is usually more important.
*Although the Plasma Shrimp is more effective at stacking status effects on enemies than the AtG Missile Mk. 1 in nearly all cases (since it adds +0.2 proc coefficient while the AtG adds 10% of the original), its low proc coefficient means that the extra stacks inflicted will have extremely low duration. However, this is still useful for attacks that have a low proc coefficient themselves.
**Notably, because stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen}} are refreshed when a higher-duration stack is inflicted, the extra stacks of Bleed from the Plasma Shrimp can be reset repeatedly.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}}. 

Upon dying, the holder will be revived after a few seconds. This will trigger any on-death effects, such as the ice explosions from {{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite}} [[Monsters#Glacial|Elites]]. Upon reviving, the holder gets 3 seconds of {{StatusEffectLink|Immune|invincibility}}, and the item is consumed. Additionally, all items in the player's inventory that have a void variant will become [[Items#Void|corrupted]].

== Notes ==
* The following lists all items that will be corrupted by Pluripotent Larva:
** {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} → {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}}
** {{ItemLink|Rusted Key}} → {{ItemLink|Encrusted Key}}
** {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}} → {{ItemLink|Needletick}}
** {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} → {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}}
** {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} → {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}}
** {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}} → {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}}
** {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} → {{ItemLink|Plasma Shrimp}} 
** {{ItemLink|Ukulele}} → {{ItemLink|Polylute}}
** {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} → {{ItemLink|Voidsent Flame}}
** {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}} → {{ItemLink|Tentabauble}}
** {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}} / {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}  → {{ItemLink|Singularity Band}}
** {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} → {{ItemLink|Benthic Bloom}}
** All [[Items#Boss|{{Color|boss|boss}} items]] (excluding {{ItemLink|Artifact Key}}) → {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}}
* The {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Extra Life|altText=revive}} from the [[Shrine of Shaping]] takes precedence over {{ItemLink|Seed of Life}}, which itself takes precedence over {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} and Pluripotent Larva.

== Tips ==
* Due to a Legendary items' rarity, {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} is much harder to find than Pluripotent Larva. As a result, the Pluripotent Larva is an excellent alternative to extra lives and can be found much easier with the use of {{ItemLink|Encrusted Key|altText=Encrusted Keys}}.
* Depending on how many items can be corrupted at the time of revival, this item could be detrimental depending on the corruptible items in question.
** {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} may be useless with certain abilities such as {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|altText=MUL-T's}} {{skillLink|Retool|MUL-T}}, where its uncorrupted variant could be far more useful.
** Converting 57 Leaf Clovers into {{ItemLink|Benthic Bloom|Benthic Blooms}} removes the player's luck and also begins randomly upgrading their items to higher tiers, which could remove valuabable common/uncommon items.
** {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}} will convert all boss items, which can take away very powerful sources of damage.
** Converting {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}  into {{ItemLink|Lost Seer's Lenses}} can be very detrimental if the player has several skills or items involved with crit, or is planning to fight one of the final bosses.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band|altText=Runald's}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band|altText=Kjaro's}} Bands will be converted to {{ItemLink|itemName=Singularity Band|altText=Singularity Bands}}, which can be devastating to high burst damage survivors like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}}, and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}}, as the Singularity Band deals much less damage than the other bands, and has double the cooldown.
* If the player encounters a {{ItemLink|Benthic Bloom}} and has access to a {{ItemLink|Recycler}}, they can convert the item into a Pluripotent Larva 100% of the time. This is because these are the only two {{Color|void|Void}} {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} items in the pool and the Recycler cannot recycle something into the same object.

== Trivia ==
* Instead than the usual "Revived!" message that appears when triggering its uncorrupted variant, Pluripotent Larva will instead display "Revived..?"
* The term "pluripotent" refers to a cell that can give rise to a variety of different cells; this is referenced by how this item gives rise to void items.
* This item, on the character model of whoever is holding it, constantly moves its eye. However, this can only be noticed if the holder stands still.
* Items that are obtained for the first time with this corruption do not count for the logbook.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

This item causes all missile-related items, equipment, and skills to fire two more missiles ''per missile'', tripling the number of missiles fired. Additional stacks do not increase the number of missiles fired further, but instead increase missile damage by 50% (''+50% per stack'') [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]].

== Notes ==

The following items and skills are affected by the Pocket I.C.B.M.:

* {{ItemLink|Bundle of Fireworks}}
* {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}/{{ItemLink|Plasma Shrimp}}
* {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}}
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|Thermal Harpoons|Engineer}}

== Tips ==
* The Pocket I.C.B.M. can pair very well with a {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst}} and {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}}, as it can dramatically increase the Launcher's damage capabilities while quickly becoming available once again with the Soulbound Catalyst.
* Combining the Bundle of Fireworks with the {{ItemLink|Remote Caffeinator}} for on-demand fireworks becomes even more effective with the Pocket I.C.B.M., allowing the player to purchase healing soda while generating huge amounts of homing fireworks.
* Every individual missile lock of {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|Thermal Harpoons|Engineer}} is affected by this item, resulting in the number of missiles being tripled regardless of volley size.

}}

== Trivia ==
* The Jans Czar quoted in this item's logbook entry is also quoted in the entry for the {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}.
* This item is likely a spiritual successor to the [[ror:AtG Missile Mk. 2|AtG Missile Mk. 2]] from the first Risk of Rain game, which was a legendary item that gave a chance to fire 3 missiles on hit. 
* I.C.B.M stands for '''I'''nter'''c'''ontinental '''B'''allistic '''M'''issile.
* The item's description specifies only affecting items and equipment, despite it working with {{SkillLink|Thermal Harpoons|Engineer}}.
* Despite being a missile in both function and description, {{SkillLink|skillName=Scrap Launcher}} is unaffected. This may simply be for balance reasons as it would effectively triple {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T|altText=MUL-T's}} damage output and proc rate.
* {{EntityLink|entityName=Missile Drone|altText=Missile Drones}}, the {{EntityLink|entityName=TC-280 Prototype}} and entities affected by {{ItemLink|itemName=Spare Drone Parts}} wont be affected by this item when firing missiles.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

When the holder hits an enemy, there is a 25% chance to create a blast of void energy targeting that enemy. This blast will hit 3 times (''+3 per stack''), with each hit dealing 60% [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] with a proc coefficient of 0.2, for a total of 180% (''+180% per stack'') total damage per proc.

This item is the void variant of the {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}. When this is picked up, all stacks of Ukuleles will be converted into an equal number of Polylute stacks. In addition, all future Ukuleles picked up will be immediately converted into more Polylutes.

== Tips ==
* On attacks with proc coefficients of 1.0, one Polylute averages out to a ~45% damage increase.
* The Polylute is in theory similar in power to Ukulele. Ukulele applies &lt;math&gt;TOTAL \times 80%&lt;/math&gt; on 3 other targets, while Polylute applies &lt;math&gt;TOTAL \times 60%&lt;/math&gt; on the same target 3 times. While losing the area-of-effect of Ukulele seems to be significant, Polylute allows the holder to kill the original target much faster and then turn their attention to other enemies.
** However, the Polylute supersedes the Ukulele in power when there are 2 or fewer enemies near the original target. This makes the item extremely valuable over its original counterpart against the final bosses, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

When the holder takes damage that brings them below 25% of their [[Health|maximum health]], this item is consumed and they are healed for 75% of their maximum health. This effect will only consume a single stack of this item. Consumed Power Elixirs are transformed into {{ItemLink|Empty Bottle|Empty Bottles}}, which do nothing and cannot be [[Scrapper|scrapped]].

== Notes ==
* While the player is holding this item, a faint black line will appear over the health bar at the 25% mark, signifying when this item's effect will trigger.
* Paying the second or third offering at a [[Shrine of Blood]] will immediately consume a Power Elixir.
* If the player falls below 25% health with their {{StatusEffectLink|HealingDisabled|altText=healing disabled}} from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]], ''all'' Power Elixirs are consumed at once. No health is recovered, since healing is impossible, so all the Power Elixirs are wasted.
** This scenario is more likely to occur than it seems, when considering that Malachite Elites deal 6 times as much damage as a non-Elite monster.
** This same effect also occurs if at least 75% of your healthbar is [[Health#Shield|shield]], making this item effectively useless with {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} and {{ItemLink|Shared Design}}.
* When falling below 25% health, the {{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}}'s effect has priority triggering, followed by the Power Elixir's. Only when the Unstable Transmitter is on cooldown and all Power Elixirs are used will the {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch}}'s effect trigger.

== Tips ==
* If the player falls below 25% health while holding both a Power Elixir and a {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch}}, the Power Elixir triggers first, healing the player and preventing the watch from breaking.
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets can hold out longer against a overwhelming surge of enemies, as long as Engineer himself has some unspent Power Elixirs. Anytime a turret gets low on health, it will consume its own Power Elixirs and stay in the fight for a little while longer.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] added in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Content Update]]''. It is completed by repairing the [[Abyssal Depths#Broken REX|Broken Robot]] in the the {{EntityLink|entityName=Abyssal Depths}} with a {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}} from an [[Escape Pod]].

Completing it unlocks {{SurvivorLink|REX}} as a playable [[Survivors|Survivor]].

== Acquisition ==
The challenge requires the player to safely carry the Fuel Array from the starting Escape Pod intact to the Broken Robot within the Abyssal Depths, a task that requires them to successfully bring the Fuel Array through at least four stages without dropping below 50% health, as falling below that will cause the Array to detonate, destroying it and likely killing the holder in the process.  

Once within the Abyssal Depths, the Broken Robot can be found in the upper platforms around the center. Interacting with the Broken Robot with the Fuel Array equipped completes the challenge.

== Notes ==
* '''Only the player that inserts the Fuel Array will unlock REX!'''

== Tips ==
* The Fuel Array occupies the equipment slot, but as long as the player escorts the equipment to Abyssal Depths, they can temporarily equip another equipment in earlier stages to charge the [[Teleporter]] and defeat bosses without the Array's penalty. Afterwards, they can pick the Fuel Array back up before proceeding to the next stage.
* {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}, {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}, {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}}, and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=False Son|displayIcon=true|iconSize=24}} are unable to obtain the Fuel Array on their own, as they do not deploy in Escape Pods at the beginning of a run.
* Interacting with a [[Shrine of Blood]] instantly causes the Fuel Array to explode, unless the player has built up [[Health#Barrier|barriers]] or blocks the damage with {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}.
* Although unable to obtain it in singleplayer, MUL-T can easily clear this challenge in multiplayer by using {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool|survivorName=}}. Simply take the Fuel Array from another player's Escape Pod and immediately swap it into the second equipment slot, as its effects will only come into play if it is in the active equipment slot.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an '''[[Items|Item]]''' in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

The item grows in power by absorbing experience, storing 20% ''(+5% per stack)'' of players stats per item level up. On removal, gain all stored stats.

==Notes==
* Prayer Beads increase [[Health]], [[Health#Health Regeneration|Regen]], and [[Damage]]; the same stats as normal level-ups. The typical ratio for level-ups is 30% of base for health, and 20% for damage and regen.
*The item accumulates [[experience]] and levels up just like players do. The acquired levels are visually indicated by the {{StatusEffectLink|Extra Stats On Level Up}} buff. Any method of removal will completely drain the buff stacks.
*Prayer Beads can be removed from the player's inventory by the following methods: 
#Scrapping the item in a [[Scrapper]].
#Random removal via [[3D Printers]] or Cauldrons (found in the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}}).
#Offering the item to {{ArtifactLink|Devotion|Lemurian Eggs}}.
# Conversion by {{ItemLink|Egocentrism}} and [[Shrine of Order]].
#Forced removal during [[Mithrix#Phase 4|Phase 4]] of the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} Boss Battle.
*{{Color|note|Bug:}} When {{ItemLink|Benthic Bloom}} removes any Prayer Beads, the bonus stats are not applied but the buff stacks are lost. The reason being that the bonus stats require the player to be alive in order to be applied but the player has not respawned yet during stage transition when Benthic Bloom's effect is activated.
**Mithrix does not steal items from dead players, so this bug does not affect a dead player who is later revived, e.g., by {{ItemLink|Seed of Life}}.
* When paying out the stat bonuses, the bonus is accumulated according to the current [[Survivors|survivor's]] level-up stat value. For example, if one converts 5 buffs stacks to bonus stats as {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} at 20% per stack, they will gain a 100% damage bonus, i.e., 12. If this survivor then transforms into {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} with the {{ArtifactLink|Metamorphosis}}, this bonus will still remain as 12 and will not be converted into a value of 15 (Acrid's base damage).
**This adds an extra layer of strategy when playing with this Artifact, as the player may decide to delay paying out the bonuses until they are playing as a Survivor with relatively high level-up stat values.
**The accumulated regen bonus can be used to offset {{SurvivorLink|Heretic|Heretic's}} inherent negative regen when one transforms into her. However, if the player then pays out more Bead Levels the regen bonus will be decreased accordingly. The accumulated bonus value is not applied to the character's stat if it ever becomes negative, so the worst case is completely undoing any accrued bonus so far.

==Math==
The procedure for calculating how much experience goes towards bonus stats is fairly complicated and depends on two internal values:

*''beadExp'': tracks the experience accumulated by Prayer Beads, which levels up at the same rate as [[Level#Player Level|players]]. Every time the player gains a Bead Level, they gain 1 buff stack.
*''convertedLevels'': tracks how many Bead Levels the player has converted to bonus stats. When any number of Prayer Beads are removed from the player's inventory, their current Bead Level is accumulated to this value and then it resets to 0.

The experience that goes towards accumulating Bead Levels depends on the experience rewarded by the original rewarded experience, ''exp'', which can then be increased by the number of Prayer Bead stacks the player holds and decreased by ''convertedLevels''. The decrease is to make the XP gained less and less worth it the more the player has already boosted their stats.

&lt;math&gt;increase = exp \times \lfloor 0.25 \times (stacks - 1) \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
	
&lt;math&gt;decrease = exp \times \lfloor 0.025 \times convertedLevels \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;expBoosted = exp + increase&lt;/math&gt;
	
At this point if ''decrease'' is greater than ''expBoosted'', it is capped at 80% of ''expBoosted''. The accumulated Bead XP is then simply
	
&lt;math&gt;beadExp = beadExp + expBoosted - reduction&lt;/math&gt;
	
With only 1 stack there is no XP bonus and for 40 or more ''convertedLevels'' the Bead XP becomes 20% of the original XP. However, for every 4 stacks beyond the first one, the negative effect of 40 ''convertedLevels'' is cancelled out while any excess ones allow to accumulate Bead XP at an accelerated rate. Therefore stacks of 1, 5, 9, etc, are the critical thresholds and any values in between do not offer any additional benefits in terms of accumulated XP. However, multiple stacks should increase the stat boost pay out (assuming this behaviour is fixed).

===Stat Bonuses===
When any number of Prayer Beads are removed from the player's inventory, each of the stats is increased by

&lt;math&gt;bonus = buffStacks \times statLevelUp \times (0.2 + 0.05 \times (itemStacks - 1))&lt;/math&gt;

However, this formula is currently flawed, since ''itemStacks'' is the number of stacks remaining '''after''' removal while it should have been the number of stacks that were removed.

If the player has only one stack and it is removed, they will receive a bonus of only 15%. On the other hand, if they have three stacks, for example, after removing one they will be rewarded a bonus of 25% as if they had removed two stacks instead. Similarly for a scrapper if the player scraps all of their 7 stacks, they will be only rewarded a 15% bonus, while if they scrap 10 out 32 stacks, they will be rewarded a bonus of 125%.

==Tips==
*Due to the logarithmic scaling of leveling up, less experience is required to gain the first few levels and by resetting the Bead Level occasionally one can gain new buff stacks faster. As an example, if one were to earn 2000 XP, it would amount to 10 levels. If one were to pay out one stack, they would gain 10 level bonuses at 15% per stat. Getting another Prayer Beads and paying out another 2000 XP would net another 10 levels, for a total of 20 levels at 15% per stat (equivalent to 2.85 extra levels in terms of stat increases). If instead one were to hold onto the first stack, in the same scenario they would have accumulated 4000 XP, which is only 12 levels, and when paying out it would have been at 20% per stat (or the equivalent of 2 extra levels).
**Finding another item stack and a [[Scrapper]] on the same stage leaves the player with a context-related dilemma. If they are planning to finish their run soon, e.g., by fighting {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}, one cannot guarantee another Scrapper will be found in time and it makes more sense to pick up the new stack before scrapping both now. Otherwise it would be more beneficial to scrap any currently held stacks and then pick up the new stack so one can gain new levels faster. 
***The {{ArtifactLink|Delusion}} gives the opportunity of getting two stacks on the same stage.
* If one finds both a Prayer Beads 3D Printer and a Scrapper on the same stage, one can continuously scrap and reprint stacks to quickly gain tens of level bonuses. If the player is [[Environments#Looping|looping]], just a few kills would be sufficient to earn 10 buff stacks at a time.
* While holding onto the item any buff stacks gained are permanent, which can consistently contribute towards activating {{ItemLink|Growth Nectar|Growth Nectar's}} effect.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Predatory Instincts|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The first Predatory Instincts a player obtains grants +5% [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] chance. Stacking more Predatory Instincts will ''not'' increase critical strike chance further.

When the holder lands a critical strike, they get a stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AttackSpeedOnCrit}} for 3 seconds, increasing their attack speed by 12%. The holder can have up to 3 (''+2 per stack)'' stacks of this buff, for up to 36% ''(+24% per stack)'' increased attack speed.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description does not specify the +5% critical strike chance.
* The duration of the buff is multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the attack.

== Trivia ==
* This item's lore entry alludes to players stacking {{ItemLink|itemName=Lens-Maker's Glasses}} in Risk of Rain 1, claiming that the creature that killed Providence, the final boss of the game, had "22 unblinking, crimson eyes."
** In Risk of Rain 1, Lens-Maker's Glasses did not grant a 10% increase to critical strike chance, but rather 7%. Reaching 100% critical strike chance required 14 Lens-Maker's Glasses.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, a 2 second long charging animation plays before firing a large, slow-moving ball of energy. This projectile shoots lightning bolts 3 times per second at enemies within 35m for 400% damage per bolt, each with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.1, and explodes on contact with an enemy or terrain, dealing 8000% damage in a 20m radius with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} This equipment actually deals twice as much damage as the game claims.

* The Preon Accumulator can be found in a [[Rallypoint Delta#Timed Security Chest|special chest]] within 10 minutes of starting a run (in-game timer, ''not'' real time).

* A {{PAGENAME}} is required to complete the challenge [[MUL-T: Gotcha!]]

* The explosion has a damage falloff starting from 15m and ends at 20m, falling off to about 25% of the explosions damage. 

== Tips ==
* Since this equipment has the longest cooldown in the game, it is recommended to activate it wisely if the player has no equipment cooldown items, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Soulbound Catalyst}}.
*It is recommended to ''not'' use the {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}}, as it will force the Preon Accumulator to fire whenever ready. This makes it likely that the player will waste a high-damage attack.
* If the player has {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}, {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, or {{ItemLink|Singularity Band}} it is important to note that both the lightning bolts and the explosion itself are capable of activating these items. Due to the potent damage of the explosion, significant damage can be dealt if the player manages to make the ball of energy explode before it ever fires a lightning bolt. This can be done by shooting the projectile while right next to an enemy or by firing it directly into a wall.

== Trivia ==
* The Preon Accumulator is very similar in function to the [[wikipedia:BFG (weapon)|BFG]] from DOOM, and is called the BFG in the game files.
* The shipping address being listed in the logbook as Mesquite, Texas is a reference to the book [[wikipedia:Masters of Doom|Masters of Doom]], where it explains how DOOM was made, specifically in Mesquite. 
* The tracking number is likely also a reference to DOOM, which was originally released in 1993. 
* [[MUL-T: Gotcha!]] is also a reference to DOOM, named after a level from DOOM 2 and requiring the player to kill an [[Imp Overlord]] using the Preon Accumulator.

'''Prime Meridian''' is a alternate final stage [[Environments|Environment]] introduced in the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' expansion. Prime Meridian can be accessed by interacting with a [[Halcyon Shrine]], entering the green portal, and completing the next two stages while entering their green portals as well. It mainly serves as the arena for the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' final boss, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=False Son (Boss)|altText=False Son|altUrl=False_Son_(Boss)}}.

In order to reach the False Son, the player must ascend a winding pathway that is burdened with challenging obstacles.

While time is stopped on this stage, unlike [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]] the stage count increases after leaving the stage and the interactables from {{ItemLink|Rusted Key}}, {{ItemLink|Shipping Request Form}}, and {{ItemLink|Encrusted Key}} also spawn.

==Interactables==
{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters==
{{MonsterList}}

==Raining Lightning Spears==
Once the player wanders off a bit from the spawning point, the screen turns orange, the stage is populated with monsters and lightning strikes start hitting near the player's location constantly. These explosions have a radius of 6m and deal 10% of the player's health as damage, while inflicting {{StatusEffectLink|Lunar Ruin}} for '''7 minutes'''.

The player should take caution and avoid as many of these attacks as possible, because multiple stacks of this debuff will considerably increase the damage they take from any attacks.

==Aurelionite Geodes==
Scattered along the path to the boss are 6 geodes, which upon activation cleanse any debuffs and nearby projectiles from any players that are within a 12m from the geode, similar to {{ItemLink|Blast Shower|Blast Shower's}} functionality. Additionally they grant 50% of each player's max health as [[Health#Barrier|barrier]].

While going out of one's way to activate them is optional, they can help with any mobility issues by cleansing any Lunar Ruin stacks. Furthermore, if the player breaks all 6 geodes, they will be rewarded with an [[Halcyon Shrine#Aurelionite Fragment|Aurelionite Fragment]] once they reach the base of the boss' arena (one for each player).

===Locations===
Their locations are somewhat randomised, with 4 being guaranteed spawns, while the other 2 are selected from a list of 8 potential locations.

The fixed spawns are

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;
Aurelionite Geode (Guaranteed) 1.jpg|1. To the right of the spawn point.
Aurelionite Geode (Guaranteed) 2.jpg|2. Along the ascending section of the path.
Aurelionite Geode (Guaranteed) 3.jpg|3. Further up when turning right to cross a bridge.
Aurelionite Geode (Guaranteed) 4.jpg|4. Near the ramp at the top of the path.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The random spawns are

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 1.jpg|1. At a dead-end past guaranteed geode #1.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 2.jpg|2. At the end of a dead-end path below guaranteed geode #2.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 3.jpg|3. After the ascending section with guaranteed geode #2 and before turning right.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 4.jpg|4. To the left before crossing the bridge for guaranteed geode #3.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 5.jpg|5. Behind the floating broken arch section before reaching the top of the path.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 6.jpg|6. On top of the floating broken arch section.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 7.jpg|7. To the right at the top of the path near a dead-end.
Aurelionite Geode (Random) 8.jpg|8. At the top of the path next to the jump pad.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Large Chests==
Scattered around the stage are also 4 [[Chests#Large Chest|Large Chests]], selected from 9 possible locations. Unlike the Aurelionite Geodes, they can be at very hard-to-reach areas, requiring impressive amounts of mobility. Furthermore, intentionally lingering around to gather enough gold from monsters runs the risk of being inflicted with too many Lunar Ruins stacks, making survival much harder.

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" widths="320px" heights="180px"&gt;
Prime Meridian Large Chest 1.jpg|1. On a far away island left from the spawn point.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 2.jpg|2. At a dead-end past guaranteed geode #1.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 3.jpg|3. At the end of a dead-end path below guaranteed geode #2.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 4.jpg|4. At the isolated island when taking the path below guaranteed geode #2.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 5.jpg|5. On a rock to the right of guaranteed geode #2.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 6.jpg|6. Jumping down to an isolated island before turning right for guaranteed geode #3.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 7.jpg|7. Jumping from the floating broken arch section to an island.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 8.jpg|8. Behind the floating broken arch section.
Prime Meridian Large Chest 9.jpg|9. On a far away island after reaching the ramp at the top of the path.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Cauldrons==
Taking the jump pad at the end of the path takes the player to the base of the boss's arena. This circular platform features a tree in the center and around it are 5 Cauldrons, randomly selected from 6 {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}, 6 {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}, and 6 Common ones.

Approaching the tree will also drop the reward for destroying all Aurelionite Geodes (see previous section). If the player has accidentally missed any geodes when reaching this area, they can go back down to complete the sidequest and upon returning the reward will appear.

This area servers as a sanctuary from monsters and lightning spears, allowing the player to prepare before the boss fight. Taking the ramp at the outer part of this platform leads to the encounter with False Son.

==Logbook Entry ==
The Logbook is right above the area spawn.

The '''Primordial Cube''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, it launches a slow-moving black hole that pulls in monsters in a 30m radius. The black hole lasts 10 seconds and will stop moving upon collision with the ground.

==Tips==

* Use the black hole to pull enemies away from the player, or to group them together for area-of-effect damage, such items like {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} and skills like {{SkillLink|Orbital Probe|Captain}}, {{SkillLink|Arrow Rain|Huntress}}, and {{SkillLink|Charged Nano-Bomb|Artificer}}. 
*The Cube is useful for the challenge [[The Demons And The Crabs]], since the{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Hermit Crab|altText=Hermit Crabs}} can be pulled off of ledges by the black hole.
*This equipment makes clearing the [[Artificer: Massacre]] challenge easier, since the player can group up enemies to finish them off all at once.
*Enemies can be dragged into the air by the black hole, essentially disabling the movement of ground based enemies.
*Primordial Cube has no limit to the number of black holes, and can be activated every frame; this can cause significant lag when paired with very large numbers of {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} and {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}}.
*Primordial Cube makes getting Pots onto the Pressure Plates in Abandoned Aqueduct exponentially easier, as you only need to get a pot nearby and spawn a black hole atop the plate.
*With enough black holes you can make a gravitational force strong enough fling enemies and some bosses into oblivion and kill them via fall damage
**However sometimes this is not recommended as it can '''softlock''' your run

      <text bytes="26527" sha1="ai5hn40gbdy8l0gpwkx1v6e70hv5duj" xml:space="preserve">The '''proc coefficient''' is the factor by which an item's effect, trigger chance, duration, or any combination of the three is scaled (multiplied).

This affects how certain "hits" can be "worse" or "better" at activating on-hit effects, depending on how high (or low) the proc coefficient is. If something hits very frequently, it may have a lower proc coefficient to lower the power of the ability to not outclass other abilities. Conversely, an infrequent, hard-hitting ability may have a higher proc coefficient to make up for the fact that it doesn't hit too often. 

This also means that a character may need more than 100% "chance" from a collection of items to guarantee that desired proc. 

In Hopoo Games Development Thoughts #1, the developers introduced the concept of proc coefficient like so: 

: "MUL-T’s nailgun has a low proc coefficient per nail of 0.4 compared to most character’s 1.0, so he isn’t proccing stuff a ton faster than other characters." ''- Quote from NaKyle, 03/30-2019.''

''(Note: Since the 1.0 update, MUL-T's nailgun has a proc coefficient of 0.6 rather than 0.4. The quote is given primarily as rationale for the proc coefficient system.)''

It is worth noting that proc coefficients do ''not'' affect [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike chance]] from items such as {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}. All attacks are guaranteed to deal critical damage once 100% critical chance is reached.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 ===
Suppose that a bullet has a proc coefficient of 0.5, and we have 1 {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}}. The dagger normally contributes a +10% chance to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} on the victim for 3 seconds. However, with a proc coefficient of 0.5, the chance to inflict Bleed is halved (since we multiply that chance by 0.5), so the bullet's chance to inflict Bleed is only 5%. Additionally, the duration of Bleed is also halved, so even if the bullet does successfully roll the 5% infliction chance, the Bleed status will only last 1.5 seconds instead of 3. 

=== Example 2 ===
Suppose we have the same bullet with a proc coefficient of 0.5, but this time we have 18 {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger}}, totaling +180% bleed chance. With the proc coefficient of 0.5, this makes the bullet have a 90% chance to inflict Bleed, instead of 100%. This means that we will need at least 20 daggers to guarantee Bleed from this bullet. Additionally, the duration will still be halved (1.5 seconds), no matter how many daggers we have. 

== Key Points ==

* A character with skills that have lower proc coefficients will require more items to reach a similar effect than skills with higher coefficients, but those caps for effects with [[Item Stacking#Linear Stacking|linear stacking]] can still be reached.
* Skills and effects with low proc coefficients often hit faster than normal or hit more than one target. Because of this, those skills and effects may tend to be '''more''' effective at utilizing item effects with [[Item Stacking#Linear Stacking|linear stacking]] for their trigger chance (notably Bleed effects) than those with higher coefficients but that hit slower or hit fewer targets.  The caveat is, of course, that these skills require a greater investment required to reach their maximum potential. Exceptions also exist; for instance, many of {{SurvivorLink|Commando|Commando's}} skills hit very quickly but also have very high coefficients.
* Critical strike chance is ''not'' affected by the proc coefficient.

For more information on item stacking mechanics and strategies, see [[Item Stacking]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the brother of {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}, defeated after the events of Risk of Rain by the Survivor, the unnamed protagonist.

== Appearance ==

== Interactions ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Heretic|Heretic (Kur-skan)}} (Lore)
** Kur-skan teleported onto the [[ror:UES Contact Light]] and attempted to rewire the ship for some purpose, but Providence appeared in the bay and killed her. As punishment, {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy|}}{{ItemLink|Hooks of Heresy|}}{{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy|}}{{ItemLink|Essence of Heresy|}}4 pieces of her were split, twisted, and cast to the farthest regions of the {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement|Moon}}.
* The Survivor 
** The Survivor, equipped with at least 11 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} killed Providence.
* "Her"
** An unknown, female being that sacrificed her life for Providence.
* {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}}
** Providence took a design of Mithrix and increased the ratio of Soul.

== History ==
===Childhood===
Providence is brother to Mithrix. Where they came from, there were gravity wells and worms. Providence loved the worms, but Mithrix did not care for them. One day, Mithrix tossed a worm into a gravity well to see what would happen, and Providence saw him.

=== Collecting for Petrichor V ===
At some point, Providence and Mithrix travel to {{EntityLink|Petrichor V}}. Providence puts all of the "planet-killers", monsters on other planets that were doomed to die onto the planet.

===Betrayal===
Providence created {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} with soul, however {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} disagreed, believing soul is unnecessary and makes creatures frail, banishing it to Gilded Coast. Due to Mithrix’s repeated hatred for soul opposing Providence’s love for it, he snapped, eventually betraying Mithrix by sending him to Commencement and closing the portal, trapping him there.

=== UES ===


=== Risk of Rain ===

=== Death ===
The Survivor, who survived by crash-landing onto the planet using an escape pod on-board the [[UES Safe Travels]], gathers items, fights monsters, and catalogues his encounters in his notes over the course of Risk of Rain. Eventually he takes a teleporter which teleports him to the wreckage of the UES Contact Light which was revealed to contain cages for the many monsters he faced and even some of the teleporters. At the bridge, he encounters Providence who proceeds to attack him. Eventually, he kills Providence, before activating the ship to travel off. Despite this, he felt a deep wrongness after killing Providence.

=== Post-Death ===
Due to Providence's influence no longer taking effect, 

== Mentions ==
* The Lore for {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}} references the Survivor, equipped with 22 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses|unblinking, crimson eyes}} defeating Providence.
** &lt;code&gt;A demon, fallen from the Sky, mighty enough to slay Providence and his Wurms. Only two arms, two legs - but with 22 unblinking, crimson eyes.&lt;/code&gt;
* {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured}}
** One of Providence's designs are responsible for the creation of the Teleporter
** Mithrix describes the void of Space as a 'dark sea' that causes 'sickness', which suggests that their kind are unable to survive in Space.
* {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}}
** Mithrix is speaking to one of the {{MonsterLink|Kipkip the Gentle|}}{{MonsterLink|Wipwip the Wild|}}{{MonsterLink|Twiptwip the Devotee|}}{{MonsterLink|Guragura the Lucky|}}[[Twisted Scavenger]]s, also ranting about how Providence warped his designs.
* {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}
** Mithrix describes to Providence compounds that drive reality, mass, blood (heat) and soul which is in an adjacent reality.
*{{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}
** Mithrix speaks to himself, but to Providence
* {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}
** Providence imprisoned {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} in that environment.
* {{EnvironmentLink|Treeborn Colony}} / {{EnvironmentLink|Golden Dieback}}

{{ItemPage}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is the counterpart to {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}. It reduces all the holder's skill cooldowns by a flat 2 seconds (''+1 second per stack''), but will make their chance effects less likely to occur by rolling them 1 extra time (''+1 per stack'') to be unsuccessful.

The following chance-based items ''can'' reach 100% chance, and therefore are useful even with the Purity: {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}} (and other [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strike]] items), {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}, {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}, and{{ItemLink|Ghor's Tome}}.

The following chance-based items ''cannot'' reach 100% chance, and are therefore less useful the more negative luck the player has: {{ItemLink|Stun Grenade}}, {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, {{ItemLink|Bandolier}}, {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}}, {{ItemLink|Sentient Meat Hook}}, {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}}, {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}}, {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, and  {{ItemLink|Tentabauble}}.

Items that have guaranteed effects, such as the {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}} or {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band|alt=Kjaro's}} and {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}, are unaffected by Purity.

== Math==
If ''p'' is the probability of a favorable event occurring without any luck modifiers, the probability of the favorable event is &lt;code&gt;p ^ (x + 1)&lt;/code&gt;, where ''x'' is the number of Purities held. 
*For example, if the player has 1 Purity and 2 {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb|altText=Sticky Bombs}}, the probability of a bomb without any Luck modifiers is 10%. Therefore, the probability of a bomb with 1 Purity is &lt;code&gt;0.1 ^ 2 = 1%&lt;/code&gt;

==Notes==
*The luck stat affected by Purity is the same as the one affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}, and as such, equal stacks of Purity and the Clover cancel each other out.
*The flat cooldown reduction of Purity is applied ''after'' the reductions of {{ItemLink|Alien Head}}, {{ItemLink|Light Flux Pauldron}}, {{ItemLink|Lysate Cell}} and {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}, making it stack extremely well with them.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} is unaffected by Purity, due to it being unaffected by the luck stat in general.
*The cooldown reduction can only reduce skills' cooldowns to a minimum 0.5s.

==Lore==

==Trivia== 
*The shape of the Purity is a [[wikipedia:Great stellated dodecahedron|great stellated dodecahedron]], being an icosahedron with triangular pyramids on every face.

{{MonsterPage|Beetle Guard (Ally)}}
The '''Queen's Gland''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Queen}}.

The holder gains a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Guard}} ally that fights for them. This Beetle Guard is much more powerful than normal; it deals 4 times as much damage and has twice as much health as a regular Beetle Guard. The number of Beetle Guards a player can have at once is equal to the number of Queen's Glands they have.

A new Beetle Guard is summoned as soon as the game finds a suitable location and if the player does not have the maximum number of Guards yet. 

==Notes ==
*The respawn timer of 30 seconds is bugged and does not work properly. It starts with a timer of 0, so upon item pick up the Beetle Guard will attempt to spawn immediately. There is also a second internal cooldown timer of 1 second, which is used to retry a spawn when it has failed, e.g. because of chosen location. However, this internal cooldown is used even when a spawn has succeeded.
*If the player damages the allied Beetle Guard with an item such as the {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}, it will give chase and attempt to attack the player. However, it will not do any damage.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, one Queen's Gland will result in two Beetle Guards spawning with half health.
*The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the few [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] items that {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets will not inherit.

'''[REDACTED]''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by opening the [[Rallypoint Delta#Timed Security Chest|Timed Security Chest]] found in [[Rallypoint Delta]] before the in-game timer reaches 10 minutes.

Completing it unlocks the {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} for use as an [[Items#Active Items|equipment]] drop.

==Acquisition==
The Timed Security Chest is found only within Rallypoint Delta and always holds a Preon Accumulator. It is guaranteed to always appear on Rallypoint Delta, though the location of the chest will be random. From the moment a run starts, players will have 10 minutes to reach Rallypoint Delta, locate the chest, and open it before the digital clock on the chest's front surpasses the 10:00 mark, at which point the interface will turn red and the chest will be permanently locked for the remainder of the run.
==Tips==
[[File:Timed Security Chest.png|192px|thumb|The Timed Security Chest]]
* There is no special key or specific method to open the chest; the only requirement is that the player reaches and opens it before the timer on the chest hits 10 minutes.
* Because the chest can spawn in different locations, it is important to consider the time needed to find it.
*Though there are three possible locations for the chest, the location will always be indicated by two (or three) small, flashing red pylons preceding the chest's location for a specific run.
* Rallypoint Delta can be selected as the next stage by visiting [[Bazaar Between Time]] during Stage 2, at the cost of [[Lunar Coins]].
** The in-game timer will be paused while in the Bazaar.
* [[Prismatic Trial]]s can have Rallypoint Delta as a first or second [[Environments|Environment]], which greatly cuts down on the time needed to reach the chest.
** The same applies for [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]], where Rallypoint Delta can be the first Environment. Note that in this version of the Environment the Timed Security Chest always spawns in the same location, which is near the ground level. If the Assessment Focus spawns far away from the spawn point, the player will get another chance to get near it after Wave 5 when the Assessment Focus relocates.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2.   

REX’s attacks are powerful and strike from a great distance, but in exchange, some require REX's health as a resource. Proper skill timing and health management are required to keep REX in the fight. In addition to health stealing and powerful group management, REX can put {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Weak|altText=weakening}} on opponents to help REX deal more damage and take less.

Completing the [[Power Plant]] challenge will unlock REX as a playable survivor.

==Behaviors==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

#'''Use special and flee''': REX must be within 8m from the target.
#'''Use special''': REX must be within 25m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it.
#'''Use secondary and stop''': REX must be above 50% health, have line of sight to the target, and be aiming at it. A new target will be selected after this and the behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use primary and strafe''': REX must be within 20m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. A new target will be selected after this and the behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Use primary and chase''': REX must be within 30m from the target, have line of sight, and be aiming at it. A new target will be selected after this. If REX is within 20m from the target and the other skills are on cooldown, it will alternate between strafing and chasing the target while using the primary.
#'''Chase while using primary''': no requirements. Unlike the majority of entities which just chase their targets if they have nothing else to do, REX will do so while constantly using the primary.

==Tips==
*All skills that require health to use do so in a manner similar to a [[Shrine of Blood]], although they take a percentage of {{Color|rex|REX's}} ''current'' health instead of their maximum. This means:
**The percentage of health taken is calculated from {{Color|rex|REX's}} current health plus current [[Health#Shield|shield]] and [[Health#Barrier|barrier]].
**Like regular damage, barrier is consumed first, then shields, then health.
** The damage can be mitigated with {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate}} or blocked entirely by {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}}. 
***Uniquely, the damage taken from {{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}} is ''not'' reduced by the Repulsion Armor Plate. This may be an oversight.
** The damage will activate the {{ItemLink|itemName=Medkit}},  {{ItemLink|itemName=Planula}} and {{ItemLink|Razorwire}}.
*It may be tempting to prioritize healing items to recoup HP costs for {{Color|rex|REX's}} skills. However, since they restore a percentage of ''max'' HP, their healing scales well into the endgame without much need for other sources of healing.  
**This also means that the normally-situational {{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Opinion}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Aegis}} will always be useful for {{Color|rex|REX}}.
*The {{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} can be particularly effective on {{Color|rex|REX}} when used in conjunction with {{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}}. Use the black hole to gather up enemies and launch {{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}} into them, or pull enemies towards an already-planted {{Color|rex|Growth}}.
*{{Color|rex|REX}} can make good use of the {{ItemLink|itemName=Old War Stealthkit}}, as they are much more likely to be at low health than other Survivors.
*Similarly, {{Color|rex|REX}} can activate the {{ItemLink|itemName=Genesis Loop}} with ease and relative safety by using self-damaging abilities to reduce their health and following up with healing abilities.
*Walking backwards, jumping, and using {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Disperse}} at a downward angle can launch {{Color|rex|REX}} notably upwards.
*Using {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Disperse}} 3 times in midair with a {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}} will push the player backwards at a very high speed.
**The Afterburner reduces the cooldown enough that {{Color|rex|REX}} can effectively fly everywhere, although it is somewhat challenging to control.
*Using {{Color|rex|Seed Barrage}} prevents the ending lag of {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Inject}}, allowing {{Color|rex|REX}} to attack much faster than normal at the cost of the HP.
*It is highly recommended that the player avoid {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}, {{ItemLink|Wake of Vultures}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Silence Between Two Strikes}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}} when playing {{Color|rex|REX}}. These items can replace health with [[Health#Shield|shields]], which cannot be recovered from healing and only recover over time after avoiding damage. This can totally cripple {{Color|rex|REX}} as abilities such as {{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}}, {{Color|rex|Seed Barrage}}, and {{Color|rex|Bramble Volley}} take a percentage of health, but do not rebuild shield. Additionally, using any self-damaging skill will reset the 7 second period necessary to recover shields.
*It is highly recommended to avoid the {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, as using any self-damaging skill will immediately cause the player to lose large amounts of [[gold]].
*{{Color|rex|Natural Toxins}}, {{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}}, &amp; {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Harvest}} all inflict debuffs innately, making it easy for {{Color|rex|REX}} to apply{{ItemLink|Death Mark}} with the addition of two status effects.
* Due to the high health-to-HP-gain ratio of {{Color|rex|Bramble Volley}}, it is often recommended to take it over {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Disperse}}. In addition, {{Color|rex|Bramble Volley}} can be used to knock oneself back in the same manner as {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Disperse}}, meaning that no mobility is lost- but it has to be used sparingly.
*{{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}} can be used to regain large amounts of HP and lock enemies in place to strike them all at once with {{Color|rex|Seed Barrage}}, {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Drill}}, or {{Color|rex|Bramble Volley}}.
**Having  {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} can inflict huge damage on the rooted enemies, as they are all pulled very close together.
*{{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}} can root the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss}}, greatly restricting his movement. However, he is still capable of dashing to break free (which removes his debuffs as well), so this is not quite as effective as outright freezing him as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}}.
*{{Color|rex|Tangling Growth}} can slam flying enemies into terrain for high damage. This can be used to easily defeat the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alloy Worship Unit}} by smashing it into the central pillar at the right angle.
*A large amount of attack speed will cause {{Color|rex|DIRECTIVE: Inject}} to break, meaning it only fires one, non-healing syringe per shot. The attack speed required, however, can only be reached by comically high stacks of attack speed based items, such as {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|REX}} by completing an entire [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] while under 50% [[Health]].

==Tips==
*[[Shrine of Blood|Shrines of Blood]] can help reduce the player's health easily before the Teleporter Event.
* Players should use [[Interactibles#Drones|turrets and drones]] and/or {{ItemLink|itemName=The Back-up}} to distract and damage enemies while using {{SkillLink|Seed Barrage|REX}} to keep their health below 50%.
* Using the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} will not count as being below 50% health, despite lowering maximum health to 10% or 50% of the normal amount respectively.
*Having shields equal or greater to the player's health, then taking damage so that all the shields are gone, and damaging yourself so the shields won't regenerate, will make sure you won't heal yourself over 50%, since shields cannot be recovered with healing.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|REX}} by killing a {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}} on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]] by throwing it into a pit.

== Tips ==
* The hardest part of this challenge is to get a {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}} to spawn near a pit on Abandoned Aqueduct. Once one appears, shoot at it to get its attention and stand far enough away from it so that it (slowly) gives chase. Stand on the opposite side of a pit to force it to go along its border. Once it is close enough to the hole, get behind it and shove it into the pit with {{SkillLink|DIRECTIVE: Disperse|REX}}.
*It may be easier to do on a longer run, where a {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}} may spawn naturally in the environment, making it less of a hassle to find the opportunity.
*The {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}} makes this challenge considerably easier, giving REX bonus uses and reduced cooldown for DIRECTIVE: Disperse.
*Items that can passively kill such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Unstable Tesla Coil}} or the {{ItemLink|itemName=Razorwire}} should be avoided in order to avoid accidental killing of the {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}}.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Opinion}} should be avoided due to the ability for {{SurvivorLink|REX}} to heal and proc it dealing more unwanted damage and possibly killing it.
*If the player has a damaging equipment, they should also avoid {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}} due to its possible unwanted activation.
*It should also be noted that items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}} can also result in unwanted killings.
*Any items that spawn allies can also be hazardous to take for the challenge due to their ability to kill the {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}} so, it is best to avoid items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Queen's Gland}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Empathy Cores}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Defense Nucleus}}.
**Even the {{ItemLink|itemName=Squid Polyp}} should be avoided due to the ability for its Squid Turrets to push around the {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}} making the challenge much harder.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|REX}} by healing 1000 or more [[health]] in a single tick.

== Tips ==
* The player ''does not'' need to be at low health - healing 1000+ health even at full health completes the challenge.
* The easiest way to achieve this is to combine a {{ItemLink|Lepton Daisy}} or {{ItemLink|Foreign Fruit}} with a {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}, which will heal 100% of the player's max health in a single tick. As long as the player has 1000 maximum health or more, this will complete the challenge immediately.
** Using a {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}} will also heal for 75% of the player's max health in a single tick.
** Getting a few {{ItemLink|Infusion}} can help to reach this max health value faster.
** Getting a {{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} provides a significant boost in getting the required health amount.
* Using a {{ItemLink|itemName=Super Massive Leech}} will clear the challenge if REX can deal 5000 or more damage at once.
* Attempting to use REX's own healing skills to clear this challenge is ''not'' recommended.
** To get 1000+ healing in a single tick, {{SkillLink|Tangling Growth|REX}} needs to root a large group of enemies, and REX must have multiple Rejuvenation Racks.
** Each heal from{{SkillLink|Bramble Volley|REX}} is treated as a separate tick, no matter how many enemies it hits at once.

''Not to be confused with [[Radio Scanner]], an interactable that unlocks Environment logs.''

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2.

When activated, a holographic projection will quickly emanate from the player outward, marking every [[Interactables|interactable]] within 500 meters with an icon for 10 seconds. 
* [[Equipment Barrel]]s, [[Radio Scanner]]s, [[3D Printers]], [[Launch Pads#Fan|Fans]], the [[Abyssal Depths#Broken REX|Broken REX]] in [[Abyssal Depths]], the [[Scavenger|Scavenger's Sack]], [[Void Cradle]]s, and Void Potentials, are marked with [[File:InventoryIconOutlined.png|24px]].
* [[Barrel]]s and Stalks are marked with [[File:BarrelIcon.png|24px]].
* [[Interactables#Shrines|Shrines]] and [[Cleansing Pool]]s are marked with [[File:ShrineIconOutlined.png|24px]].
* [[Drones|Broken drones]] and {{EntityLink|Gunner Turret|Turrets}} are marked with [[File:DroneIconOutlined.png|24px]].
* [[Chests]], [[Items|Dropped items]], [[Lunar Coins]], and [[Scrapper]]s are marked with [[File:LootIconOutlined.png|24px]].
* The [[Teleporter]] is marked with [[File:TeleporterIconOutlined.png|24px]].
* [[Lunar Pod]]s, [[Newt Altars]], [[Launch Pads#Platform|Platforms]], pressure plates (on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]]), [[Portals]], and Deep Void Signals are marked with [[File:MysteryIcon.png|24px]].

== Notes ==
* Although this item covers a large radius, it is not infinite and some interactables may potentially be excluded from the scan depending on the player's position.

== Tips ==
* {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone|Equipment Drones}} can make good use of this item by drastically reducing the cooldown, allowing for much more frequent scans for players looking to speedily locate Chests, Shrines, Barrels, Drones, Items, Lunar Pods, and the Teleporter (pre-activation). The only caveat is that Equipment Drones do not use their equipment unless they are looking at an enemy.
* This item can especially help to find the [[Chests#Rusty Lockbox|Rusty Lockbox]] for the {{ItemLink|itemName=Rusted Key}}, or the [[Chests#Encrusted Cache|Encrusted Cache]] for the {{ItemLink|itemName=Encrusted Key}}.

''Not to be confused with {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}}, an equipment that scans for interactables''

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' (also known as '''Radar Tower''', '''Environment Scanner''') is an [[Interactables|interactable]] that can spawn on all [[Environments]], except [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]]. When purchased, the entire stage will be scanned, similarly to the {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}}, however it does not reveal anything on the map. but the Environment Data of the corresponding stage will be added to the player's Logbook.

Once the Environment Data of a stage has been acquired, the Radio Scanner will never spawn again on that stage. In multiplayer, having at least one member of the party who doesn't possess the Environment Data of a stage will allow the corresponding Radio Scanner to spawn.

== Tips ==
* The Radio Scanner has a higher chance of spawning if the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} and {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} are active, as they disable [[Chests#Multishop Terminal|Multishop Terminals]], [[3D Printers]], [[Cleansing Pool]]s, [[Scrapper]]s, and [[Chests]] from spawning.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2, unlocked by default in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion.

A lethal and skillful markswoman, the Railgunner fights with her eponymous railgun. In combination with powerful piercing shots and smart homing rounds, Railgunner has incredible long-range damage output and decent crowd control options. Her signature ability is the incredibly powerful, all-or-nothing Supercharge that can devastate even the strongest of enemies in a single shot.

* Unlike other Survivors, {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} ''cannot'' get random [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strikes]]. Instead, she is ''guaranteed'' to get critical strikes when hitting enemies' exposed weak points, and her critical strike chance increases the amount of damage her critical strikes deal.
* Each 1% of critical strike chance becomes 1% bonus critical strike damage; for example, having 50% critical strike chance means a critical hit will deal 150% bonus damage instead of the usual 100% bonus (for a final 250% of the normal damage, instead of the usual 200%).

{{Skill

| type     = Primary
| cooldown =

| notes    = 
* Fires 4 times per second at base attack speed.
* The skill does not become inactive without targets nearby, unlike {{SurvivorLink|Huntress|Huntress's}} {{SkillLink|Strafe|huntress}}, {{SkillLink|Flurry|huntress}}, and {{SkillLink|Laser Glaive|huntress}}.
* While the attack shoots out forwards, it may home in on enemies that {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} is not looking at.
* The shots have slight recoil, enough to disable the effects of {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}.
}}
}}

{{SkillType|Secondary|
{{Skill
| name     = M99 Sniper
| type     = Secondary
| cooldown = N/A
| proc     = 1.0
| notes    = 
* Replaces {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary with {{SkillLink|M99|Railgunner}}. &lt;!-- this is a bit more nuanced because of Active Reload, but it gets wordier trying to explain its interaction with AR --&gt;
* Scoping in takes 7 frames (0.116 seconds), after which {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary skill becomes {{Color|railgunner|M99}}. A visual decoration expands for 6 frames afterwards. Pressing the primary button during the 7-frame scope-in results in a shot from {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} ''unscoped'' primary, not an {{Color|railgunner|M99}} shot.
* After taking a scoped shot and unscoping, {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary skill becomes {{SkillLink|Active Reload|Railgunner}} until her rifle is reloaded. While reloading, {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} cannot activate {{Color|Railgunner|M99 Sniper}} again.
* Unscoping takes 14 frames (0.233 seconds) when the key is released, and the reload indicator does not appear until fully unscoped.
** Pressing the secondary button during this 14-frame window will immediately scope back in, although {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} must still reload once the 14 frames are up. However, this allows her to scope back in while reloading, enabling faster shots overall. If the player misses this 14-frame window, they ''cannot'' scope in again until reloaded.
* At default attack speed, the cursor reaches the perfect reload zone 30 frames (0.5 seconds) after the reload indicator appears, allowing for a default minimum time between shots of 0.733 seconds (about 1.36 shots per second) assuming perfect inputs of both unscoping and reloading, and rescoping before fully unscoped.
** With perfect inputs rescoping only ''after'' reloading, the default minimum time between shots is 0.849 seconds (about 1.17 shots per second).
* Having any {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|Backup Magazines}} allows {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} to take multiple consecutive shots (1 per second at base attack speed) before having to reload. All charges reload at once.
** However, only the first shot taken after a perfect reload receives the bonus.
}}
{{Skill
| name     = M99
| type     = Primary
| cooldown = 
| proc     = 1.0
| notes    = 
* This skill is only available when holding down {{SkillLink|M99 Sniper|Railgunner}}, while the reload bar is not active.
** If the player immediately rescopes after unscoping, and fails the perfect reload, {{Color|Railgunner|M99}} will not reload charges.
}}
{{Skill
| name     = Active Reload
| type     = Primary
| cooldown = 
| proc     = N/A
| notes    = 
* {{Color|Note|Correction:}} a perfect reload increases the next ability's damage by {{Color|d|+500%}}, not {{Color|d|+100%}}
* This skill is only available after firing {{SkillLink|M99|Railgunner}}.
* Approximately 0.28 seconds after releasing the secondary skill (unscoping), this skill temporarily replaces {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary.
** While this skill is available, the player cannot activate {{SkillLink|M99 Sniper|Railgunner}}.
* After unscoping, a reload bar appears with a cursor that moves from left to right and a colored "perfect reload" zone. Pressing the button while the cursor is in the perfect reload zone not only allows {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} to fire again faster, but the next  {{SkillLink|M99|Railgunner}}, {{SkillLink|Supercharge|Railgunner}} or {{SkillLink|Cryocharge|Railgunner}} attack deals an extra {{Color|d|500% base damage}}.
** Unscoped Primary Fire does not apply or expend the bonus damage buff.
** The damage bonus is indicated by a red lightning icon in the top-left corner of {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} HUD.
* Failing a perfect reload prevents {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} from firing again until the cursor has moved all the way across the cursor reaches the end. At default attack speed, this takes exactly 2 seconds from the moment the reload indicator appears.
* The perfect reload zone becomes wider with increased attack speed, making perfect reloads easier.
* The bonus damage buff is lost when firing {{SkillLink|M99|Railgunner}}, even if the shot does not hit any targets.

* Unlocked via the [[Railgunner: Marksman]] Challenge. ''({{ChallengeDesc|Railgunner: Marksman}})''
* Replaces {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary with {{SkillLink|HH44|Railgunner}}.
* Scoping in takes 6 frames (0.1 seconds), after which {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary skill becomes {{Color|railgunner|HH44}}. Pressing the primary button during the 6-frame scope-in results in a shot from {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} ''unscoped'' primary, not an {{Color|railgunner|HH44}} shot.
* Scoping in takes 6 frames (0.1 seconds). {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} Primary skill is replaced with {{Color|railgunner|HH44}} at the end of this duration.
* Unscoping takes 30 frames (0.5 seconds), but {{Color|railgunner|H44}} is replaced with {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} normal primary ''immediately'' upon releasing the key.
}}
{{Skill
| name     = HH44
| type     = Primary
| cooldown = 
| proc     = 1.0
| notes    = 
* This skill is only available when holding down {{SkillLink|HH44 Marksman|Railgunner}}.
* {{Color|Railgunner|HH44}} fires 2 times per second at base attack speed.
* {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} does not need to reload between shots while using {{Color|Railgunner|HH44}}. While this does lower the downtime between shots, this also means she cannot benefit from perfect reloads or Backup Magazines.
* Unlike {{Color|Railgunner|M99}}, {{Color|Railgunner|HH44}} fires automatically as long as the primary key is held.
** This allows for a near-instant shot immediately upon activating {{Color|Railgunner|HH44 Marksman's}} scope.

{{SkillType|Utility|
{{Skill
| name     = Concussion Device
| type     = Utility
| cooldown = 6s

| notes    = 
* {{Keyword|u|Agile}}.
* Unlike {{SurvivorLink|Acrid|Acrid's}} {{SkillLink|Caustic Leap|acrid}} and {{SkillLink|Frenzied Leap|acrid}}, this skill does ''not'' give fall damage immunity during its duration, so launching too high into the air can result in severe fall damage.
* If another Concussion Device is thrown while another is active, the first one will immediately detonate.
* Targets take no damage from the explosion itself, but if launched high enough or off a ledge, can take fall damage.
* The force of the push is based on the target's current velocity plus some additional force. It is independent of distance from the device, though because the direction of the push is directly away from the device, airborne targets (including {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} herself) further away are generally pushed more level with the ground than if they are closer.
** Because the force of the push is based on current velocity, jumping (adding vertical velocity) just before the device detonates results in a stronger push.

* Upon casting, after approximately 2 seconds at base attack speed, replaces {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} primary with {{SkillLink|Supercharged Railgun|Railgunner}}.
* The cooldown for this ability begins upon casting. Failing to fire in time will cause the cooldown to continue uninterrupted, but taking the shot puts it on full cooldown again. It will only begin to cool down once {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} weapons come back online. 
* Increased attack speed reduces both the charge time and the duration that {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} weapons are disabled after firing the shot.
* If {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} has the {{ItemLink|itemName=Visions of Heresy}} and/or {{ItemLink|itemName=Hooks of Heresy}}, neither {{SkillLink|Hungering Gaze|heretic}} nor {{SkillLink|Slicing Maelstrom|heretic}} are disabled after taking a {{Color|railgunner|Supercharge}} shot.

* Enemies brought to or below their execution threshold will not be executed by that shot, requiring a second shot to be executed.
* After using this skill, {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} can fire immediately afterwards with {{Color|Railgunner|M99}} without having to reload inbetween.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use special''': Railgunner must be within 300m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and the '''Use Primary (Snipe)''' behavior is set to follow it after.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': Railgunner must be within 60m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use secondary''': Railgunner must be within 300m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 0.3 seconds. The '''Use Primary (Snipe)''' behavior is set to follow it after.
# '''Use primary (Snipe)''': Railgunner must be within 300m from the target. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row. The primary key is held down for the duration, which means if Railgunner uses the M99 Sniper, they will miss the active reload. Similarly, for HH44 Marskman only one shot will be fired and for the remaining duration of the behavior Railgunner will behave as if firing the primary. This behavior makes poor use out of both secondary skills, while the special skills are not affected.
# '''Use utility and flee''': Railgunner must be within 25m from the target.
# '''Use primary and flee''': Railgunner must be within 8m from the target.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

==Tips==
*Due to its curving trajectory, the {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} can fire at targets obscured by cover, as well as up to 30 degrees behind the player.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Ocular HUD}} provides 100% increased {{Keyword|d|Weak Point}} damage for the duration.
*The piercing attacks of {{Color|railgunner|M99 Sniper}} and {{Color|railgunner|HH44 Marksman}} suffer from piercing damage falloff. This means that for each enemy pierced by a shot, the damage to the next enemy is halved. 
**{{Color|railgunner|Supercharge}} and {{Color|railgunner|Cryocharge}} do not have this attribute and deal the full damage on each pierced enemy.
* Since {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} already has extremely high single-hit damage, she benefits greatly from picking up {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band}}.
*Hitting a monster's weak point will trigger the attack speed increase of {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}}. With {{Color|Railgunner|M99}}, this provides improved reload speed and reduces the delay between subsequent shots granted by {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}}. With {{Color|railgunner|HH44}}, this simply allows for faster shots overall.
* Items that deal [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] are particularly powerful for {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} due to the high damage dealt by her scoped skills. Even {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} has a proc coefficient of 1.0, allowing it to activate on-hit items fairly consistently, similar to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando|altText=Commando's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap|survivorName=Commando}}, but with automatic tracking and shorter range.  
**{{Color|Railgunner|Supercharge's}} higher proc coefficient of 3.0 gives it a higher chance to trigger some chance-based total damage items such as the {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, which can add onto the already massive damage of the original attack. This also means the radius of the {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth|Brilliant Behemoth's}} explosions is tripled by {{Color|Railgunner|Supercharge's}} shots, going from 4 meters at base to 12.
***In particular, {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} only needs 7 {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}} to guarantee triggering them with this ability assuming base [[Luck]], almost tripling the already monstrous damage of this ability while giving it even more crowd-clearing potential due to the explosion's AoE and the piercing attribute creating a bomb per each target hit. {{Color|railgunner|Cryocharge}} instead requires about 14 stickies due to its lower 1.5 proc coefficient but can still be effective.
*As {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} critical strikes are tied to hitting exposed weak points with her secondary and special skills, acquiring both the {{ItemLink|itemName=Hooks of Heresy}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Essence of Heresy}} will prevent her from landing any critical strikes.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Backup Magazine}} allows the {{Color|Railgunner|M99 Sniper}} to fire multiple shots back-to-back without needing to reload. However, any subsequent shots granted by Backup Magazines will not be affected by the +500% damage increase granted by a successful active reload. The fire rate of subsequent shots is only marginally faster than {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} reload speed, so stacking Backup Magazines can prevent players from taking advantage of the active reload bonus. 
**It is a valid tradeoff to exchange damage output for easier shots, especially when holding attack speed items, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Soldier's Syringe}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Predatory Instincts}}, which generally reduce the gap between reload and no-reload damage.
**The {{Color|Railgunner|HH44 Marksman}} secondary is unaffected by the Backup Magazine due to the lack of a reload, rendering the item useless.
*The recoil from {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} can be used to change the trajectory of a {{Color|Railgunner|Concussion Device}} jump. Shooting horizontally or straight down can double the distance traveled. However, when used incorrectly, this can reduce the effectiveness of a {{Color|Railgunner|Concussion Device}} jump by decreasing {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} speed before the mine explodes.  
**Having enough attack speed boosts makes {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} able to fly when shooting {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} downwards.
*If timed well, {{Color|Railgunner|Concussion Device}} can be used to negate fall damage. Throwing one device onto the ground and throwing a second to immediately detonate the first before hitting the ground can greatly reduce downward momentum.
**Likewise, the recoil from {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} can be used to greatly mitigate fall damage. This is much easier than using a {{Color|Railgunner|Concussion Device}}, albeit less effective without high attack speed.
*The recoil from the {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}}, {{Color|Railgunner|M99}}, and {{Color|Railgunner|HH44}} is enough to deactivate {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus|altText=Bustling Fungus'}} healing aura, and {{Color|Railgunner|Railgunner}} will stop sprinting upon firing {{Color|Railgunner|XQR System}} or activating {{Color|Railgunner|M99 Sniper}} or {{Color|Railgunner|HH44 Marksman}}, deactivating {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}} as well.
**Curiously, collecting 10 or more {{ItemLink|itemName=Paul's Goat Hoof}} will completely negate non-vertical recoil from the {{Color|Railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}}. This effect is present even when standing still, allowing{{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus|altText=Bustling Fungus'}} field to remain active while firing.
*{{Color|Railgunner|Cryocharge}} will not execute enemies on its own even if they end up frozen below the execution threshold. Follow up immediately with a shot to ensure a kill.
* The scope-in from {{Color|Railgunner|M99 Sniper}} and {{Color|Railgunner|HH44 Marksman}} lowers the cursor slightly. The distance is about one barrel in height. When quick-scoping, adjust aim accordingly.
*After performing a {{Color|Railgunner|Concussion Device}} jump next to a cliff, placing another {{Color|Railgunner|Concussion Device}} on the cliff wall gives additional height.
*The {{ItemLink|itemName=Primordial Cube}} synergizes well with {{Color|Railgunner|Supercharge}} to maximize the number of enemies it hits. This also trivializes the {{SkillLink|Cryocharge|Railgunner|altUrl=Railgunner: Trickshot|Trickshot}} challenge.
*As both {{Color|Railgunner|M99 Sniper}} and {{Color|Railgunner|HH44 Marksman}} change {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} Primary skill while scoped, {{SkillLink|skillName=Hungering Gaze|survivorName=Heretic}} will not cool down while scoped. This prevents it from regaining any charges, delaying recharge until unscoped again. 
**However, when unscoping, the total charges of Hungering Gaze become equal to the number of shots available while scoped. By default, this means unscoping will immediately set Hungering Gaze to just 1 charge and trigger the cooldown, but having any number of {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|Backup Magazines}} will increase the number of charges available after unscoping. With 11+ Backup Magazines, Hungering Gaze can be recharged instantly simply by scoping and unscoping.
**For the {{Color|railgunner|M99}}, the total number of charges will update after reloading. For the {{Color|railgunner|HH44}}, the total number of charges will update at the beginning of each stage.
* Equipment can be used while scoped. For example, {{ItemLink|itemName=Royal Capacitor}} can be used to finish off a low health target after a successful or unsuccessful shot, or it can even be used to hit a target that is otherwise very difficult to hit while scoped.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Razorwire}} can mitigate {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} vulnerability to nearby enemies to an extent by occasionally dealing damage to nearby enemies, as can {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Unstable Tesla Coil}}, {{ItemLink|Frost Relic}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Egocentrism}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Voidsent Flame}}. By dealing with nearby enemies, these items also allow {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} to focus her attention on more distant enemies. 
**A {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}} can also help mitigate the {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner's}} weakness to fast-moving monsters by consistently slowing them. Firing a single shot (such as with {{Color|railgunner|XQR System}} or {{Color|railgunner|HH44}}) to apply the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow60|slowed}} effect can help subsequent attempts to hit the monster's weak point.
*Monsters which move quickly tend to have low maximum health, making them more vulnerable to {{Color|railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} than a larger, slower enemy, and more vulnerable to area effects, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}}. This effect is amplified with {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}}, as these monsters spend most of their time either above 90% health or dead.
*Being a mobility skill, {{Color|railgunner|Concussion Device}} can help create some much-needed distance between the {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} and melee targets, allowing time to shoot them from afar.
*Non-Boss monsters flinch when taking a large percentage of their maximum health in damage, allowing {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} to line up additional shots easily. For {{MonsterLink|Larva|altText=Larvae}} in particular, synergy with {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} allows {{Color|railgunner|Railgunner}} to interrupt their leap or charge with {{Color|railgunner|XQR System}} long enough to kill them.
** The low damage of {{Color|railgunner|XQR System}} is generally not enough to cause a {{MonsterLink|Larva}} to flinch without the assistance of damage-increasing items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Delicate Watch}}, however.

===Weak Points===
Weak Point locations vary based on the type of monster and are consistent across all enemies of that type.
*The weak point of most monsters with a head is on its head. 
** The weak point of a {{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab}} is at the very top of its shell.
*The weak point of most monsters without a head, or whose body is its head, is at its center.
**A {{MonsterLink|Malachite Urchin|altText=Malachite Urchin's}} weak point at its center.
**The {{MonsterLink|Healing Core}} spawned by a [[Monsters#Mending|Mending]] elite also has a weak point at its center, and it can be killed before it detonates, preventing it from healing nearby monsters.
*Most Bosses and some other monsters have unusual weak point locations.
**The weak points of a {{MonsterLink|Gup}} or {{MonsterLink|Geep}} are on its "eyes".
**The weak point of a {{MonsterLink|Gip}}, however, is at its center.
**The weak point of a {{MonsterLink|Mini Mushrum}} is at the center of its head.
**The weak point of a {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}} is at the bottom of its head, where its "legs" emerge.
**The weak points of a {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}} are on the tips of its tentacles. When charging Homing Orb Bomb, its tentacles retreat towards its center and can overlap slightly.
**The weak points of a {{MonsterLink|Grandparent}} are on its hands.
**The weak points of a {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}} (and {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}) are on its eyes. 
**The weak points of a {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)}} are at the center of its left and right cannons.
**Each of the five eyes of an {{MonsterLink|Imp Overlord}} is a weak point.
** The weak point for {{MonsterLink|Newt}} is its crippled left hand.
*An enemy that moves unusually quickly ({{MonsterLink|Blind Vermin}}, {{MonsterLink|Imp}} (when not teleporting)), {{MonsterLink|Larva}}, {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Exploder)}}, {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}}, or {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}), moves unusually erratically ({{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture}}, {{MonsterLink|Blind Pest}}, or {{MonsterLink|Larva}}), or teleports frequently {{MonsterLink|Imp}}, {{MonsterLink|Parent}}) can be difficult to hit at all, let alone on its weak point, and the weak point of a monster that moves its weak point frequently ({{MonsterLink|Alloy Vulture}}, {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard}}, {{MonsterLink|Elder Lemurian}}, {{MonsterLink|Parent}}, {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen}}, {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan}}, and {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}}) can be difficult to hit unless the enemy stands still. 
**Monsters that move along the ground generally do not have any air control while jumping or flying through the air. Because their arc while flying through the air is very consistent, this can be an important window of opportunity to score a weak point hit on an evasive enemy. Monsters that move their weak point during their attacks similarly don't move their weak point in any unusual ways while jumping or flying through the air.
**Even monsters that move their weak point will generally hold still, however briefly, at important times, such as for a brief period at some point during the activation time of an ability or while all their abilities are on cooldown. This, too, can be an important window of opportunity to take a shot.
**Monsters which teleport have a brief cooldown period after teleporting during which they can't teleport again. Following a target, waiting for it to teleport, and lining up a shot during this window could mean the difference between a hit and a miss.
*The weak point of an enemy that rapidly approaches to a close distance ({{MonsterLink|Blind Vermin}}, {{MonsterLink|Imp}}, {{MonsterLink|Jellyfish}}, or {{MonsterLink|Larva}}) can be especially difficult to hit with {{Color|railgunner|M99}} due to its high magnification. Enemies who are particularly close can be difficult to hit even with {{Color|railgunner|HH44}}. These enemies should be prioritized (or pushed away with {{Color|railgunner|Concussion Device}}) before they are allowed to close too much distance.
**A {{MonsterLink|Larva}}, which is normally very difficult to hit, can be staggered with even the small amount of damage that {{Color|railgunner|XQR Smart Round System}} deals, even when it is in the air. If it is in the air when hit, it will fall to the ground and stand still very briefly, allowing a small window to hit its weak point (though even a body shot or continued fire from {{Color|railgunner|XQR System}} will generally kill it).
*A {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor}} has no weak point, and moves so quickly that it can be very difficult to hit it with {{Color|railgunner|M99}} or {{Color|railgunner|HH44}}.

==Trivia== 
*After using Supercharge, Railgunner's primary and secondary skill icons become the same "unplugged" symbol that {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Orbital Probe|Captain}} and {{SkillLink|Orbital Supply Beacon|Captain|altText=Orbital Supply Beacons}} use when he is in [[Hidden Realms]].
*Railgunner starts with a +101% critical strike damage, as every survivor starts with a 1% critical strike chance (Railgunner included).
*Railgunner is the first character to have a proc coefficient higher than 1.0 on a skill, and is tied with the {{MonsterLink|Wandering Vagrant}} for the highest proc coefficient of any skill in the game.
*Railgunner's {{Color|railgunner|Concussion Device}} technically '''deals''' zero damage, meaning that it may be blocked by {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}}.
**Additionally, this means that {{Color|railgunner|Concussion Device}} will break pots found on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]]
*Railgunner is the successor to the Risk of Rain 1 character, [[Ror:Sniper|Sniper]]. Sniper was originally planned to appear in Risk of Rain 2, as weak point data for many enemies existed in the game unused, but they were ultimately scrapped and reworked later into Railgunner. 
**In reference to this, Railgunner's Mastery skin heavily resembles the Sniper. The backpack of the Mastery skin even has Sniper's Spotter drone at the bottom, possibly implying that the skin is meant to ''be'' Sniper themselves.
*While Railgunner's HUD will usually read "All Systems Nominal" with an orange tint, the color will change to red and the text will read "System Error - Unknown Input Detected" whenever she has {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} by dealing 1,000,000 damage in one shot.

Completing it unlocks the {{SkillLink|skillName=Polar Field Device|survivorName=Railgunner}} in Railgunner's loadout.

==Tips==

*It's advised to use {{SkillLink|skillName=Supercharge|survivorName=Railgunner}} when attempting this challenge, due to its extremely high innate damage potential.
*Stacking {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} can make this challenge trivial.
*The damage itself does not need to be dealt with a M99 Sniper shot, it can also be dealt with other damaging items such as an {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, which can also be stacked for an easier unlock.</text>

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} by hitting 30 consecutive {{SkillLink|skillName=M99 Sniper|survivorName=Railgunner}} shots without missing a Weak Point. 

Completing it unlocks the {{SkillLink|skillName=HH44 Marksman|survivorName=Railgunner}} in Railgunner's loadout.

==Tips==
*Perfect reloads are not required for this challenge, only hitting the Weak Points themselves.
**It may even be advised to intentionally miss perfect reloads to do less damage, so more consecutive Weak Point shots can be put into one stronger enemy.

* The {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} may be used to roll for a stage with enemies that have easy-to-hit Weak Points like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Jellyfish|altText=Jellyfish|displayIcon=true}} or {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lesser Wisp|altText=Lesser Wisps}}.

* Newt in the Bazaar between time's hand counts for this challenge.
* Enemies hit with piercing count as a shot (i.e. if you shoot a shot and it hits 2 enemies' weak points, it counts as 2 weak point hits)
** If you pierce an enemy and hit at least 1 weak point but miss any others it still counts.</text>

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion. It is completed as {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} by killing 3 enemies with a single {{SkillLink|skillName=Supercharge|survivorName=Railgunner}} shot while Airborne. 

Completing it unlocks the {{SkillLink|skillName=Cryocharge|survivorName=Railgunner}} in Railgunner's loadout. 

==Tips==

*Letting weak enemies like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle|altText=Beetles}} or {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lemurian|altText=Lemurians}} group up is very effective, and can allow you to complete the challenge as early as Stage 1.
*Having more than 3 enemies group up gives a greater chance of killing as many as you need.
*{{SkillLink|skillName=Supercharge|survivorName=Railgunner}} takes about half a second to fire once triggered, keep that in mind if you're only jumping to go airborne.
*{{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} makes this challenge trivial, the artifacts {{ArtifactLink|Command}} and {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} can make the challenge faster.</text>

'''Rallypoint Delta''' is a desolate tundra located on [[Petrichor V]] and is found in the third set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2''. 

==Description==
Rallypoint Delta is the remains of a makeshift camp constructed by a group of scattered crew members from the UES Contact Light, somewhere in the frigid tundra of Petrichor V. Meagerly defended and built mostly out of empty cargo containers, it was a doomed attempt by the survivors to endure the relentless onslaught of the planet's denizens. It does appear that they were able to hold out for some period of time, given the survivors' ability to construct the signature radio tower located in the cliffs above the camp and the presence of the damaged yet repairable [[TC-280 Prototype]], a formidable and heavily-armed Drone.

By the time the [[Survivors]] of the [[UES Safe Travels]] happen upon it, Rallypoint Delta is long-abandoned and mostly buried within the snow.

Given the usage of 'delta' in its name, it can be assumed that Rallypoint Delta was one of several locations established by the survivors.

==Timed Security Chest==
[[File:Timed Security Chest.png|192px|thumb|A soon to be expired Timed Security Chest]]
The Timed Security Chest is a Chest with a timer on it. In order to open it, the player needs to reach it before the in-game timer reaches 10 minutes.

If there is a negative sign in front of the time display, the Timed Security Chest is expired, and shows how much time has passed since it locked down. Otherwise, it shows how much time left before the chest expires.

The Timed Security Chest will always hold a {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}}. Upon opening it for the first time, the [[REDACTED|[REDACTED]]] challenge is completed, unlocking the Preon Accumulator for future equipment drops.

There are three possible places the chest can spawn:
#On top of the hill next to a radar tower
#Inside a large container near ground level (randomly, the container will not appear and the chest will be laying in the snow)
#Inside an open container on top of a stack of containers

The location of the chest can be quickly identified with the small red-light standing lamps that will spawn near it. Whenever a chest is not at a spot, these lights will be turned off or missing.

File:Timed Security Chest Location 2.jpg|2.Inside a half buried container
File:Timed Security Chest Location 3.jpg|3.Inside a container at the center of the stage
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and excluding the guaranteed spawn exactly 1 more will spawn:
#Behind the tree around the coast side of map.
#Behind the large rocks near the container stack wall.
#Top area of map next to the vertical containers.

'''Rapidfire''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by reaching +200% attack speed.

==Tips==
* This can be achieved by having at least 14 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe|altText=Soldier's Syringes}}.
* Attack speed can also be increased with the {{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron}}, {{ItemLink|War Horn}}, {{ItemLink|Gorag's Opus}}, and {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}.

'''Razorwire''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

When the holder takes damage, the Razorwire instantly attacks up to 5 ''(+2 per stack)'' enemies in a 25m ''(+10 per stack)'' radius, dealing 160% damage to each with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.5.

==Notes==
* The item will also activate from self-damage sources, such as fall damage or [[Shrine of Blood|Shrines of Blood]].
*When incoming damage is blocked by {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}, or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Immune|altText=invincibility}}, the Razorwire will not trigger.
* This item is especially useful on {{SurvivorLink|REX}} since it will trigger upon use of any health-sacrificing ability, and as such is very effective with their {{SkillLink|Seed Barrage|REX}} skill.
* Areas with [[Void Fog]] are made significantly easier with this item, as the player can simply take small ticks of damage to continually attack nearby enemies.
** Take care of performing this, as the amount of damage received per tick by the Void Fog increases each hit. The damage increase can be reset by entering a safe zone.
** The {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}} are much safer to perform this, as the damage per tick does not increase.
* The {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}} will also activate the Razorwire in a similar fashion. With enough stacks of Razorwire, this can allow for map-wide attacks while the Tincture is active.
* Take care when fighting near explosive pots on [[Abandoned Aqueduct]], as the Razorwire may detonate the pots and kill the player.
*The razor bursts have a proc coefficient of 0.0 when held by Umbrae spawned by the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

This equipment can be used on dropped items and equipment to transform it into another, indicated by an orange reticle around the targeted item. The recycled item can be any item of the same tier, excluding the original item. Once an item has been recycled, it cannot be recycled again and displays a red "X" over the indicator.

The Recycler cannot recycle any items or equipment that are not found naturally in chests. For [[Items#Boss|boss items]] it is those that can be found in [[3D Printers#Overgrown 3D Printer|Overgrown 3D Printers]]. In general it cannot recycle [[:Category:WorldUnique Items|WorldUnique Items]], the {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed)}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Seed of Life (Consumed)}}, or [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite Equipment]].

== Notes ==
* When used along with a [[3D Printers|3D Printer]], this can be used to turn a random item (of the Printer's rarity) in the player's inventory into another random item.
** If an Environment contains both a 3D Printer and a {{EntityLink|entityName=Scrapper}}, the player can get alternative items by repeatedly printing, recycling, and scrapping any unwanted items. This can be especially useful for Mili-Tech and Overgrown 3D Printers, to find desirable Legendary and Boss items respectively.
* Having a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} results in the Recycler automatically transforming items when players look at them. This can be avoided by walking into the item backwards, or otherwise keeping them out of the field of view before picking them up.
* The Recycler can be used to recycle Lunar Items and Equipment as well as Void Items.
* The Recycler recycles the Pickup Object that holds the displayed item. This means if there is an unwanted Pickup A and a desired Pickup B, the player can recycle Pickup A, transfer the item from Pickup B to Pickup A and then also recycle Pickup B. An easier to understand explanation would be that this equipment recycles "spots" where items are instead of items themselves.
** In practice, this means that if there are two [[Items#Equipment|equipment]]s in a stage and the player wishes to keep one but recycle the other, they can recycle the unwanted one and then swap their positions to then recycle the unwanted one again if desired, as the game will recognize that the recycler was used in two different locations and not that it was used on the same item.

== Tips ==
* This equipment is useful by eliminating unwanted items and providing a chance to turn them into something better.
* This equipment can be especially useful if the player happens to find a {{ItemLink|Benthic Bloom}} or a {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}}. Since these two items are the only items of their tier, recycling one of them will always turn it into other.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Red Whip|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

After 5 seconds of using no offensive skills, the holder gets the {{StatusEffectLink|WhipBoost}} buff, increasing their [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] by 30% (''+30% per stack'') until they use an offensive skill again. 

== Notes ==
* Unlike the {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}, getting the Whip Boost buff requires the player to not use any skills (except for mobility skills) for 5 seconds, and has nothing to do with avoiding damage.
**As of the ''1.0 Launch'' update, all mobility skills are considered "sprinting," meaning that the buff won't be removed if the player uses such skills.

* As of the ''Hidden Realms'' update, taking damage no longer disables the buff.

* Equipment, be it damaging or not, does not disable the buff. &lt;!-- Not all equipment tested! Whoever feels like it, please confirm --&gt;
* Damaging items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Little Disciple}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Unstable Tesla Coil}} do not disable the buff.
* Skills that do not disable the buff include:
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Tactical Dive}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Tactical Slide}}
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Smoke Bomb}}
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Huntress}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Blink}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Phase Blink}}
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Transport Mode}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode}}
*** While initiating his  {{SkillLink|Power-Saw}} will cancel the buff, holding it does not affect it, meaning the speed boost can be utilized while attacking after 5 seconds. &lt;!-- This may be a Console Bug, further testing might be needed --&gt;
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Thermal Harpoons}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret}}
*** His turret's attacks are combat skills, while placing them is not.
*** Oddly, despite firing damaging missiles, Thermal Harpoons does not count as a combat skill, but {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield}} does.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Trespass}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppress}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Corrupted Suppress}}
*** Despite dealing no damage, {{SkillLink|skillName=Corrupted Trespass}} counts as a combat skill.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Nevermore}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}} ({{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}})
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}}'s {{SkillLink|skillName=Concussion Device}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Polar Field Device}}
*** Scoping in with {{SkillLink|skillName=M99 Sniper}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=HH44 Marksman}} counts as a combat skill, even without firing.
** {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alloy Vulture|Alloy Vulture's}} Utility skill which switches between grounded and flight.
** {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Blind Pest|Blind Pest's}} Primary skill which fires an acid projectile.
** {{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab|Hermit Crab's}} Mortar Volley
** {{MonsterLink|Parent|Parent's}} Utility skill (Teleport)
** {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|Mithrix's}} Special skill (Shock Wave) and Utility skill (Sprint forward)

*The [[Halcyon Shrine]] has the restriction that there must be no ceiling above its spawning location. While this environment is all seemingly underground, there are a few holes in the ceiling that shine light through. It is in fact possible to encounter a Halcyon Shrine in 3 distinct locations, which is by far the fewest for any environment:
**1 at the top of the stairs of the altar, and
**2 very similar locations near the right stairs as you face away from the altar.
*The {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan}} and {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen}} have twice the likelihood of spawning compared to the rest of the available bosses.

{{ItemPage|Regenerating Scrap (Consumed)}}
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

When interacting with an Uncommon [[3D Printers|3D Printer]] or Legendary [[Bazaar Between Time#Cauldrons|Cauldron]], if the player has any stacks of this item, it will be consumed before any other items. Unlike all other items, when this item is consumed by either a 3D Printer or Cauldron, the player will receive a {{ItemLink|Regenerating Scrap (Consumed)}}. At the start of each stage, all Regenerating Scrap (Consumed) will transform back into Regenerating Scrap.

== Notes ==
* Using this item in the [[Scrapper]] turns this item into {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Green}}, which does not regenerate at the start of each stage.

==Tips ==
*Uncommon [[3D Printers]] will never offer Regenerating Scrap.
*Even though Regenerating Scrap cannot appear in 3D Printers, there is still a printer-related exploit with Regenerating Scrap in [[Alternate Game Modes|Simulacrum]]. If the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is not active for the run, but the Augment of Command becomes active for a wave, using an Uncommon 3D Printer will generate a Command Essence instead of the displayed item. The player can choose a Regenerating Scrap from the Command Essence and then immediately use it to print a new Command Essence. This can be repeated until the wave ends, or for as long as the player can survive in the void.
*This item encourages active use of Uncommon printers. Even if the printed item is undesired, it can be later scrapped into {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Green}} for more available printing in later stages.
*5 or more stacks of this item can be used to repeatedly gain legendary items in the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time|Bazaar}}. This functions the same as [[3D Printers]], consuming the item, rather than trading it.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item increases all healing and passive [[Health#Health Regeneration|health regeneration]] by 100% (''+100% per stack''), including the player's base health regeneration.

== Tips ==
* This item synergizes very well with all healing items, {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}, and {{ItemLink|Aegis}}.
* Unless the player also has an Aegis or N'kuhana's Opinion, they should avoid the {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}}. Both of these items effectively negate all healing by turning all health into [[Health#Shield|shields]], so the bonus healing would go unused.
** The Aegis gives use to healing by transforming overheals into [[Health#Barrier|barriers]], and Nkuhana's Opinion can still weaponize healing to attack enemies from afar.
* {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}} has an interesting synergy with Rejuvination Rack. Corpsebloom stores all healing, then applies it over time. Both the healing that gets stored AND the healing that gets applied are increased from Rejuvination Rack, causing you to effectively "double dip" on the Rejuvination Rack bonus.
* The [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse]] modifier that halves all ally healing is effectively an inverse of the Rejuvination Rack, and as such collecting a Rejuvination Rack will completely negate the effect.

[[File:Vending Machine.png|thumb|Vending Machine|link=]]
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

When activated, after 5 seconds an Eclipse Zero Vending Machine crashes down, dealing 2000% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a 16m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot]] falloff. The vending machine can then be interacted with up to 12 times for a base cost of 5 [[gold]] each time (scaling with [[Difficulty#Effect on money costs|difficulty]]), which dispenses up to 3 cans of soda within 25m at a time depending on how many allies are near. These cans gravitate towards the player or their allies when they get close, each healing 25% of the collector's maximum HP.

==Notes==
*This item will trigger any on-interaction items such as {{ItemLink|Bundle of Fireworks}} and {{ItemLink|Squid Polyp}}.
*Each entity is limited to one deployed vending machine, so upon deploying a new one, the previous one will be destroyed similar to the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turrets.
**This may be frustrating if the player tries to use the vending machine spawned by an {{EntityLink|entityName=Equipment Drone}}, as it will be replaced frequently in the presence of nearby monsters. However, frequent respawning means the vending machine stays close to the player as they explore the stage, while potentially dealing damage to enemies when landing.

==Tips==
*The vending machine allows for easy, repeated use of the Bundle of Fireworks and Squid Polyp while in boss arenas or other areas which do not typically have [[interactables]]. A few stacks of Fireworks and a {{ItemLink|Pocket I.C.B.M.}} can potentially make quick work of the final bosses, even on higher difficulties.
** This strategy requires gold to function, and is therefore unusable during the first phase of the {{MonsterLink|Voidling}} fight, before normal enemies spawn. However, having a {{ItemLink|itemName=Brittle Crown}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} will help this strategy become viable during the fight.
*{{SurvivorLink|Captain}} can call down a {{SkillLink|Beacon: Hacking|captain|Hacking Beacon}} near the vending machine, which will repeatedly and automatically activate it for free (triggering on-interaction items in the process). This strategy does not work in [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realms]], however, since Captain cannot use {{SkillLink|Orbital Supply Beacon}} in these stages.

*Bug Fix
**Fixed ‘Remote Caffeinator’ DLC equipment being locked permanently

**(Undocumented) This equipment cannot be picked up in game
}}

==Trivia==
*The company name "Eclipse" is a reference to {{EntityLink|Eclipse|Eclipse mode}}, a highly challenging alternate game mode which progresses through a series of increasingly difficult modifiers. Since the vending machine is referred to with "Eclipse Zero," and because Eclipse's levels range from 1 to 8, this may signify how the vending machine's healing makes the consumer's life easier, bringing their Eclipse level even lower than normal.
**Ironically, {{EntityLink|entityName=Eclipse|altText=Eclipse 5|altImg=Eclipse5}} halves the soda's effectiveness, so the promise of life-saving beverages rings somewhat hollow in a real Eclipse run.
*The vending machine displays 6 soda cans with most likely another 6 behind them. When the interactable has fewer than 6 activations left, this will be depicted in the display accordingly.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.  

The item reduces all damage taken by 5 ''(+5 per stack)'', but it cannot reduce damage taken below 1. 

== Tips ==
* This item is most effective at counteracting [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage over time]] effects inflicted by enemies, as each individual damage tick is affected by the flat damage reduction. This also includes multiple low damage hits from enemies like {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Clay Templar}}, {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp}} or {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Wisp)}}, though their level also plays a huge factor as the reduction of the armor plate is flat.

* The damage reduction from this item is applied after the damage reduction from [[armor]].

* The Repulsion Armor Plate pairs well with the {{ItemLink|Planula}}, since the Planula's healing triggers when damaged and the Armor Plate reduces that damage taken. It's possible to gain health rapidly when attacked with rapid and weak damage.
** Both the Armor Plate and Planula fall off in effectiveness as the [[Difficulty#Scaling Difficulty|difficulty]] increases, however.
* This item does not block damage from the [[Void Fog]].

* The Repulsion Armor Plate pairs extremely well with {{SurvivorLink|Seeker}}'s {{SkillLink|Sojourn|Seeker|Sojourn}} Ability. This is because it reduces the damage taken while in Sojourn, and the survivor is immune to all outside damage.

== Trivia ==
* The Repulsion Armor Plate is a reference to the [[Ror:Repulsion Armor|Repulsion Armor]] from the first Risk of Rain, which greatly reduces damage taken and reflects damage for a short period after the holder is damaged 6 times. Presumably, the Repulsion Armor Plate is a piece of this armor.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]''.

When the holder kills an enemy, they get a stack of {{StatusEffectLink|LaserTurbineKillCharge|charge}} for 7 seconds. When they have 4 stacks of charge, the Disc removes all charge and launches itself at an enemy. It pierces enemies as it flies, dealing 300% damage (''+300% per stack'') to each, before exploding for 1000% damage (+''1000% per stack''). Finally, the Disc returns to the user, once again piercing all enemies and dealing 300% damage (''+300% per stack'') along the way. 

All these hits have a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Tips ==
* Destroying clay pots or explosive barrels will charge the Resonance Disc.
** However, the Disc can also target and attack them, which can waste its attack and prove fatal if the player is in close proximity to one.

* Activating the {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} will charge the Resonance Disc.

** Added New Item: Resonance Disc
}}

== Trivia ==
* The Resonance Disc is the successor to the [[Ror:Laser Turbine|Laser Turbine]] from the first Risk of Rain, and is actually referred to as &lt;code&gt;laserTurbine&lt;/code&gt; internally.
**The Logbook entry also mentions a turbine, presumably the Laser Turbine, and indicates that the Resonance Disc was to be sent to the same mailing address as the Laser Turbine.

* Before the [[Anniversary Update]], the math for {{PAGENAME}} was more complex. 
** While holding the {{PAGENAME}}, kills generates &lt;code&gt;2.5&lt;/code&gt; ''spin'', visible by the dot in the model flying around. ''Spin'' decays over time. Every &lt;code&gt;1/60&lt;/code&gt;th of a second, &lt;code&gt;Spin = ''previous spin'' - (1.25 ''* time since last kill in seconds)''&lt;/code&gt;''. ''In short, ''spin'' decays '''''faster''''' the more time passes between kills.
** ''Spin'', in turn, generates ''charge''. ''Charge'' does '''''not''''' decay. At 100% ''charge'', the Resonance Disc checks all enemies within the blast radius of its nearest target to see if it can hit more enemies by targeting one of them instead. After selecting a target, it will fire according to the earlier description.
** How much ''charge'' is generated from ''spin'' is dependent on time since the last kill, and the current ''spin'' used as a vertical velocity with &lt;code&gt;-0.0125&lt;/code&gt;  gravity (so upwards).

== Gameplay ==
{{Construction}}

The player(s) begins by first choosing their preferred mode (see [[Alternate Game Modes]]), then by selecting one of the playable Survivors. From here, [[difficulty]] and skill loadouts can be selected. If the player(s) have any [[artifacts]] available, they can enable them here to modify certain aspects of the game.

Each run starts by dropping all players onto the planet, most commonly inside of a Escape Pod. Pressing the interact button frees the player and allows them to begin exploring the map. Monsters will gradually and continuously spawn, and killing them grants the player two rewards: [[gold]], for opening [[chests]] to acquire [[Items]]; and experience, which increases the player's level and thus their stats, such as [[health]] and [[damage]]. 

The main objective of each stage is to find the [[Teleporter]], an [[Interactables|interactable]] that, when activated, spawns a powerful [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]]. Besides this monster, a large spherical area around the Teleporter is highlighted, and the player must stay inside this area for a certain amount of time to charge the Teleporter. However, the player also needs to defeat the Teleporter Boss to leave the stage, even if the Teleporter is completely charged.

Killing the Boss will reward the player with an Uncommon Item, sometimes a special Boss Item, and, if the teleporter is fully charged, will also allow the players to use the teleporter to travel to the next stage, in this case Stage 2. After the player interacts with the teleporter, they will have all of their current gold converted into Experience and then, after a 3 second interval, teleport to the next stage, where they must once again repeat the previously mentioned steps.

At every fifth stage (Stages 5,10,15,etc...), the player will be able to find a special variation of the teleporter called the "Primordial Teleporter". This teleporter, once charged and ready, can be used to travel to [[Commencement]], the final stage where the player can encounter [[Mithrix]], the standard final boss of the game. However, this teleporter can also be interacted with by pressing the Interact button when looking at its sides, which will "shift" the Primordial Teleporter's destination and return to one of the Environments that would normally load in Stage 1 but now being in their 6th stage, thus having "looped" and now having to repeat the previous process all over again, with new and stronger enemies to face up against.

As players who may be new to the game will come to notice, while the selected can slightly influence on how their match or "run" will play out, they will also notice that the items they take, as well as how they interact between themselves and with their characters' abilities, can ultimately define whether they succeed or fail in completing the game. Players will also notice that there are interactables capable of spawning a wide array of portals, from ones leading to [[Gilded Coast|islands of gold]], to [[Bulwark's Ambry|floating trial chambers deep in timeless abyss]] or [[Bazaar Between Time|unlikely safe havens]], as well as, occasionally, they can come across other types of portals that can take them to [[A Moment, Fractured|metaphysical spaces]] or even [[Void Locus|dimensions beyond common understanding]].

If the player was to die for whatever reason, most commonly extreme damage inflicted by their foes, it will almost certainly mean that the player's run has ended. The run ends and all of the Items that were collected are lost and the player is then sent back to the main menu, where they can choose to play again. If they are playing in Multiplayer, the player can spectate their teammates while they wait to get revived once their teammates reach the next stage. However, the dead player will only have the items they had at the time of their death once they are revived.

=== Ending A Run ===

==== Fighting Mithrix And Escaping the Moon ====
''See [[Mithrix]] and [[Commencement]] for additional information''

Once the player(s) reaches Commencement, the final stage, all they have to do is search for 4 pillars scattered around the environment, charge them and then, using a launching platform, fly up to the central platform towering above the whole level. Once all players are inside the arena, they have to walk inside the barrier, which will then summon Mithrix, the final boss of the game.

Once the players have defeated Mithrix, a 3-minute detonation sequence will begin and players will have to get down from the arena and make their way back to a landing ship they can find just before the entrance they came in from, which will then prompt them to stay inside its radius to charge it up. Once the landing ship is fully charged, the final cutscene will play and players will be greeted with a green "Victory!" screen.

==== Obliterating ====
''See [[A Moment, Fractured]] and [[A Moment, Whole]] for additional information''

Every 3rd stage after looping (Stages 8,13,18,etc...), players will be able to encounter a "Celestial Portal". Taking said portal will teleport the players to "A Moment, Fractured", a hidden level in which they can find a giant obelisk. Interacting with this obelisk will first make a glowing sphere of light appear inside of it and generate another  Celestial Portal nearby, while asking the player for another interaction. Interacting with the obelisk again will then make the players' characters evaporate and the players will then be greeted with a blue "Fate Unknown..." screen, unless any of the players has a [[Beads of Fealty|certain item]], in which case all players will teleport to "A Moment, Whole", a hidden level in which they can fight a [[Twisted Scavenger|special boss]] before their run ends.

==== Voidling ====
''See [[Voidling]], [[Void Fields]], [[Void Locus]] and [[The Planetarium]] for additional information. This content is only available through the "[[Survivors of the Void]]" Expansion.''

If the players visit the [[Bazaar Between Time]], they can find a hidden area which houses a secret "Null Portal". Taking this secret portal will teleport the players to the "Void Fields", a hidden realm filled with darkness and clouds of [[Status Effects#Void Fog|toxic void fog]], in which players will have to charge 9 Void Cells in order to clear the fog. Once the fog has cleared, players will be able to find another Null Portal and a purple "Void Portal". This purple portal can also appear randomly at any stage during their run.

Taking the Void Portal will then teleport the players to the Void Locus, in which players will have to charge up 4 transmitters, which will summon toxic void fog while they charge. Once all 4 transmitters have been charged, players will be able to find another portal, a "Deep Void Portal", which they then have to take in order to reach The Planetarium, the final stage in which they will they face up against the Voidling.

After defeating all the 3 phases of the Voidling, the players will be able to find another Deep Void Portal which they will have to take in order to end the run. Once they take the portal, their characters will be teleported away and the screen will fade to black, greeting the players with a purple "Fate Unknown..." screen.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

Whenever the holder takes damage, they gain gold equal to 12% the cost of a [[Chests|Small Chest]]. This value starts at 3 gold (''+3 per stack'') and is multiplied by the [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]]. 
== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description mentioning that the damage must originate from an enemy is incorrect, the item's effect is triggered for sources of damage originating from a character other than the holder of the item.
** This means self-damaging effects, such as the {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}, {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX's}} "plant" skills, {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|altText=Captain's Diablo Strike}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Corrupted Suppress|altText=Void Fiend's Corrupted Suppress}} do ''not'' trigger it.
*** However, in Multiplayer, {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|altText=Captain's Diablo Strike}} and {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}} can be used by a different player on this item's holder to gain extra money, while the former is an extremely impractical method, the latter is very profitable to an almost gamebreaking degree earlygame: since the hellfire damage ticks 5 times per second and lasts up to 15 seconds, activating it will trigger roll of pennies a total of 75 times for a gold amount equal to the price of 9 small chests, the total burn damage caused is 30% of the hellfire holder's max HP to themselves and 15% of the hellfire holder's max HP to the roll of pennies holder's HP (this means that, depending on how much health the hellfire holder has, the roll of pennies holder will take varying amounts of damage), but both values can be reduced drastically with even a single {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} or {{ItemLink|Planula}}, or compensated with any healing items.
***Players can also hurt each other while the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} is active to give each other money. This can even be used while playing by yourself by using an item like {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}} and attacking the summoned ally to get it to attack you.
** The {{StatusEffectLink|VoidFog}} and fall damage also do not trigger it as they are sources of damage not linked to any character.
** The explosive containers in {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Abandoned Aqueduct}} and {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Rallypoint Delta}} do trigger it as they are immovable characters.
** A projectile or persistent attack, such as the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mini Mushrum|altText=Mini Mushrum's Blazing Pool|altUrl=Mini Mushrum#Primary: Fiery Spore Bomb}}, that hits the player '''after''' the enemy has died will ''not'' trigger the effect. Dying here does not mean the enemy's health reaching zero, but the enemy's death animation completing.
***However, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lunar Chimera (Exploder)|altText=Lunar Chimera's (Exploder) death effect}} is an exception where the body persists after death as invisible until the blazing pool has expired. While the player can gain gold with Roll of Pennies by standing in the damage area, it also means that allies can continue trying to attack the monster even though there seems to be nothing there.
*An animation of a flying gold coin will play when this item's effect activates, and the animation will show more coins the more stacks the player has.

==Tips== 
*This item activates on any instance of enemy damage, regardless of its [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. This includes [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage over time]] effects, which will activate the item's effect for every individual tick of damage.
**This means that intentionally letting enemies inflict {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire}} or {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding}} can be an effective way to rapidly generate money, especially when combined with a {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} to mitigate the damage. Note that {{ItemLink|itemName=Ben's Raincoat}} renders this strategy somewhat less effective.
**Taking damage from a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Solus Probe|altText=Solus Probe's}} beam, or standing in the damage zone of a {{MonsterLink|Mini Mushrum|Mini Mushrum's}} spore bomb are also effective ways to generate money.

==Trivia== 
*Looking closely at the penny's model in the logbook shows that instead of reading "In God We Trust" like a standard United States penny, it reads "In Paul We Trust." This is a reference to Paul Morse, one of the two founders of Hopoo Games, who also has {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}} named after him.
**There is also a stone golem carved on the back of each penny.

The '''Rose Buckler''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The item grants 30 ''(+30 per stack)'' [[armor]] when sprinting.

== Notes ==

*30 armor results in a 23.08% damage reduction, with diminishing returns for each Rose Buckler picked up.
* This item is stronger on characters who have the {{Keyword|u|Agile}} tag on their skills, such as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} or {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}.
*This item is useful as a retreat tool, regardless of what [[Survivors|Survivor]], as the increased armor could allow the player to survive an otherwise lethal hit while falling back.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

While equipped, a targeting reticle appears over the monster nearest to the player's cursor. Activating the equipment while an enemy is targeted in this way calls a lightning strike on it after a half second delay, dealing 3000% damage in a 3m radius and stunning monsters nearby.

== Notes ==
* The lightning strike occurs 0.5 seconds after equipment activation. Character position is updated every frame for 0.2 seconds after equipment activation.
** Therefore, the targeted character has 0.3 seconds to escape the 3m explosion radius, or move 10m/s away from the last position update.

== Tips ==
* The Royal Capacitor deals high damage in a single hit. Stacking {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} can significantly increase this equipment's damage.

* Using the Royal Capacitor with many {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}}, {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}, and Crowbars will instantly activate the equipment with limited cooldown.  
** Be mindful of entering the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}} with this combination, as it may damage {{MonsterLink|Newt}} and lock the player out of the Bazaar. Avoid this by looking away from Newt.
* Due to the Royal Capacitor's short cooldown, it benefits from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Soulbound Catalyst}}. 
** This is particularly effective with the aforementioned Gesture of the Drowned strategy.
*The Royal Capacitor is a strong item for {{EntityLink|entityName=Equipment Drone|altText=Equipment Drones}}, as their innate cooldown reduction allows them to activate the equipment every 4 seconds with a target in sight.

== Trivia ==
[[File:RoyalCapactiorTexture.png|frameless|right|404x404px]]
* The Royal Capacitor is possibly inspired or referenced off of [https://i.imgur.com/KTPEP8N.png Sprague Powerlytic Capacitors], which have the same structure as the text on the texture for the Royal Capacitor.
* The text on the texture reads as:
** Calorum - Company that made it
** Powerlytic - The name that they called their capacitor
** 3600DE - The type of Powerlytic    
** 40000-810000DC - The range of voltage in direct current
** 910256L - Inductance 
*** In reality, the capacitor should have a capacitance value listed, not an inductance. 
*** Additionally, although L is the letter used to represent inductance as a concept, the unit of measure for inductance is actually Henris (H).

*When equipped by any survivor, their right arm is replaced by a constant streak of electricity  

* The logbook entry contains a few references to the Legendary Electric-type Pokémon [https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Zapdos_(Pok%C3%A9mon) Zapdos].
** The tracking number is the same as Zapdos' Pokédex number, 145
** "ZAP2" in the order name may be a corruption of "Zapdos", with dos being the Spanish word for two.
** The shipping address is to "Power Plant 005, Route 10". In the original games, Zapdos is found in the abandoned power plant on Route 10.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. Its counterpart is {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}.

When striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more damage, the Band creates an icy explosion that deals 250% ''(+250% per stack)'' [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|total damage]] to that enemy and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80|altText=greatly slows}} it for 3 seconds (''+3 seconds per stack''). This bonus attack has a cooldown of 10 seconds and a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.0.

== Notes ==
* In addition to dealing at least 400% damage, a hit must have a proc coefficient greater than 0.0 to activate the Bands. Damage bonuses such as [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strikes]] or {{ItemLink|itemName=Armor-Piercing Rounds}} will ''not'' cause weaker hits to activate the Bands, even if the final damage dealt is above 400% base damage.
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary|altText=Mercenary's}} signature {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=MercExpose}} debuff is an exception. When Mercenary hits an Exposed enemy, the hit deals an extra 350% damage, which ''does'' count towards the Bands' activation.
* This item always activates simultaneously with Kjaro's Band. Even if one of the Bands is acquired while the other is on cooldown, the new Band will inherit the old Band's cooldown.
* The cooldown for the Bands can be seen above the player's health bar as a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElementalRingsCooldown|altText=status effect}} with up to 10 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Bands are {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=ElementalRingsReady|altText=ready}} and can be activated again.
** Because this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the {{ItemLink|itemName=Blast Shower}} will reset the cooldown immediately.
**{{ItemLink|Ben's Raincoat}} does not provide immunity to this debuff.
* Despite the triggering hit and Runald's Band proc occurring simultaneously, the bonus damage from {{ItemLink|itemName=Crowbar}} will only apply to the proc if they remain over 90% health after the triggering hit.
* Despite firing a "runic ice blast", it does not freeze enemies. Instead it applies an 80% slow to them.

* Gameplay Changes
** Runald’s/Kjaro’s Band &lt;br&gt; ''Developer Notes: The two rings have undergone a bit of a rework, working off of an internal cooldown rather than a chance on-hit. We’re hoping that this can help diversify one of our “on-hit” items to be more than just attacking enemies and hoping things activate. We’ve also changed the behavior of Kjaro’s to be more of the AoE option, while Runald’s is the single target option.''
*** Proc Chance: 8% ⇒ 100%
*** Now has an internal cooldown of 10 seconds
*** Now has a minimum threshold of only triggering on attacks that deal 400% or greater damage
*** Ice Blast Damage: 250% (+125% per stack) ⇒ 250% (+250% per stack)
*** Ice Debuff Duration: 3s ⇒ 3s (+3s per stack)

* Gameplay Changes
** Damage: 250% (+125% per stack) additive damage ⇒ 250% (+125% per stack) total damage

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

Upon hitting an enemy there is a 3% chance to call a meteor strike, dealing 2000% base damage. Every 100% attack damage dealt increase the activation chance by 3% ''(+3% per stack)'' and damage by 150% ''(+50% per stack)''. The meteor deals damage after 1 second with a 0.5 [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] in a 10m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no damage falloff]].

==Notes== 
*There can only be only one meteor at a time by a certain character.
*The chance on hit is capped at 75% (before any [[luck]] calculations). Similarly, the damage is capped at 7500% base damage. These two caps do not occur at the same point, with the latter requiring stronger attacks to be reached.
** For both of these values maxed the expected damage is 5625% base damage, which for 1 Runic Lens stack occurs for an attack with at least 3700% base damage, e.g., the blast from {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}}.
*The proc chance is affected by the proc coefficient of the attack that calls the meteor. 
**This means {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} {{SkillLink|Supercharged Railgun}} can guarantee to proc this item due to her 3.0 proc coefficient.
*While the blast has a large radius, it is possible to miss flying enemies if they are too high up in the air since the meteor always targets the ground underneath the target.
*While the proc chain that procs the meteor cannot trigger it again, the meteor itself does not carry this information. This makes it possible for the meteor and {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, for example, to end up in a feedback loop if the AtG lands late enough for the meteor to be ready for another strike. In practice this is very unlikely to occur due to the AtG's low proc coefficient, coupled with the meteor's 0.5 proc coefficient.
* The data about the meteor's target, damage, and impending impact are tied to the attacker's body. If this character's body is destroyed before the meteor lands, there will be no blast. The fire ring surrounding the target, implying the meteor is coming, and the eventual explosion is just an independent visual effect which does not deal any damage in and of itself.
**Body destruction in this case is quite literal. When a character is killed, the body object persists for a little longer to perform its death animation, during which time the meteor can still land successfully. However, respawning destroys the old body and creates a new one.
**This can also be observed if the player transforms into the {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} while the meteor has been called.

==Math==
The definition of {{Color|u|Overspill}} is

&lt;math&gt;overspill = \lfloor totalDamage / baseDamage \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

This is used to calculate the chance of proccing the item

&lt;math&gt;chance = min(3 + 3 \times stacks \times overspill, 75)&lt;/math&gt;

When the roll is successfull, the meteor summoned deals damage equal to

&lt;math&gt;damage = min(20 + (1 + 0.5 \times stacks) \times overspill, 75)&lt;/math&gt;

This value is calculated in terms of base damage multiples, i.e., at most it will do 7500% of base damage.

The average damage done by this attack is simply &lt;math&gt;chance \times damage&lt;/math&gt;.

The following table shows how much damage the meteor will deal '''on average''' for various {{Color|u|Overspill}} and item stack values. This assumes no [[57 Leaf Clover|luck]] and a proc coefficient of 1.0. To see instead how much an instance of damage a meteor will deal whenever procced, one has to only take into account the ''damage'' formula from above.

==Tips==
*Equipment such as {{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}} and {{ItemLink|Preon Accumulator}} have high damage coefficients, making it likely that Runic Lens is procced afterwards.
*Items and skills that group up enemies, e.g., {{ItemLink|Sentient Meat Hook}}, {{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}}, and {{SkillLink|Beacon: Shocking}}, can be quite effective due to the meteor's blast radius.
*{{ItemLink|Breaching Fin}} can push enemies away from the meteor's landing spot, making this item less effective.

* Reworked Runic Lens
**Old Functionality - Overspill. 5% chance (+1% per 100% done on initial hit plus 1% per item stack) on hit to summon a meteor on the target, dealing 2000% damage.
**New Functionality - 3% chance on hit to call a meteor strike, dealing 2000% base damage. Every 100% attack damage dealt increases the activation chance by 3% (+3% per stack) and damage by 150% (+50% per stack.)

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

Each stage, a [[Chests#Rusty Lockbox|Rusty Lockbox]] spawns for each player holding a Rusted Key. The lockbox's contents are the same as a Large Chest, with an 80% chance to contain an [[Items#Uncommon|uncommon]] item and a 20% chance to contain a [[Items#Legendary|legendary]] item. One key is consumed upon opening a lockbox.

== Notes ==

* Rusty Lockboxes will spawn even if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is enabled.
* Lockboxes will only start spawning the stage ''after'' the player picks up the key; it does not modify the current stage when obtained.
* The quantity of lockboxes per stage is only related to the number of players that have keys; the number of keys held by each individual player does not matter.
** For this reason, players who have more keys than the rest should try to unlock lockboxes for other players, so that each player can still hold onto at least 1 key to spawn as many lockboxes as possible.
* Currently there is a bug, if you have 2 Rusted keys and a [[Item Scrap, White]] using a soup in the [[Bazaar Between Time]] to get a [[Shipping Request Form]] then on the next stage unless it is [[Commencement]] or [[Void Fields]] both a shipment and a lockbox (even if you don't have a key) will spawn at the 0,0 point of the stage. Most often out of reach but this can be used on purpose to easily find the shipment and the lockbox
** Attempting to do this bug a second time will crash the game unless it would have happened on [[Commencement]] or [[Void Fields]] otherwise it causes a large lag spike when approaching the 0,0 point on both of these stages.
** It is unknown why this bug occurs but some suspect the game is trying to spawn a lockbox for a key that doesn't exist causing all player related spawnables got on the stage where the key was lost to spawn in place of the lockbox.
*A Rusty Lockbox will spawn on the first stage if the player starts with a Rusted Key via the {{ArtifactLink|Rebirth|Artifact of Rebirth}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}.

When the holder would take damage, if this item is charged, the damage is completely negated, displaying "Blocked!" instead of a damage number. After blocking damage, the item must recharge for 15 seconds (''-10% per stack'') before another hit can be negated.

== Notes ==
* The {{StatusEffectLink|BearVoidReady}} status effect above the health bar will indicate whether it is charged or not, and a circular shield appears around the player's [[Survivors|Survivor]]. The effect changes to {{StatusEffectLink|BearVoidCooldown}} while it is recharging, but unlike {{StatusEffectLink|ElementalRingsCooldown}} and {{StatusEffectLink|ElementalRingVoidCooldown}}, the recharge period is not indicated with multiple stacks.
* Safer Spaces cannot block damage inflicted by the {{StatusEffectLink|VoidFog|Void Fog}} debuff.
** It can, however, block damage inflicted by opening a [[Void Cradle]] and from interacting with a [[Shrine of Blood]].

==Tips==
*Activating the {{ItemLink|Blast Shower}} recharges Safer Spaces immediately.

==Math==
The charge cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;f(x) = 15 \bullet 0.9^{x}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''x'' being the amount of Safer Spaces.

*Voidtouched enemies gain the shield recharge behavior without any item stacks, therefore their cooldown is 15 seconds.
* The minimum cooldown is 1 frame (0.0167 seconds), achieved with at least 65 stacks of Safer Spaces.

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
*(Undocumented) Fixed a bug that allowed negative buff stacks so permanent shields with {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}} is no longer possible.

; [[Survivors of the Void]]
* (Undocumented) Added New Item: Safer Spaces
}}

==Trivia==
*This item appears to be a [[wikipedia:Tardigrade|tardigrade]], a microscopic animal sometimes known as a "water bear". Tardigrades are known for their incredible survivability and resilience, being found in locations that would kill almost any other animal.
* The name "Safer Spaces" is a reversal of Tougher Times, as "safe" can be thought of as an opposite of "tough" and space is the opposite of time, as well as both names being alliterations.
*When a hit is blocked, a deeper version of the squeaky toy sound effect that Tougher Times uses is played.
*The lore quote is a direct reference to the comic ''[[wikipedia:Insufferable|Insufferable]]'' issue #6, where it is spoken by a character who is wearing makeshift armor made from multiple babies taped onto his clothing.
*Until the [[Seekers of the Storm]] teaser patch, which introduced blue comets, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss}} was capable of using the effects of Safer Spaces. However, this item has since been blacklisted to bring it more in line with Tougher Times, as high stacks of Safer Spaces could make Mithrix nigh-invincible.

{{ItemPage|Sale Star (Consumed)}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

The item allows one to gain an extra item on the first chest opened per stage. Each additional Sale Star increases the chance of getting more items up to 5 items at most. Upon using it for a purchase, the item is transformed into its consumed form and at the beginning of the next stage it becomes available again.

==Notes==
*{{Color|note|Correction}}: The chance of getting more than 2 items is more complicated than the description says. See the [[#Math|Math]] section for more details.
*Sale Star only works with the following [[Chests]]: Small Chest, Large Chest, Legendary Chest, Category Chest, Large Category Chest, Adaptive Chest, Equipment Barrel, Rusty Lockbox, and Cloaked Chest.
**A blue ring appears when the player is in range of an interactable compatible with this item and has any stacks available. This can also serve as a reminder to not use it up on low reward chests.
*If Sale Star is consumed for the stage and another one is picked up, the effect can be triggered again on the same stage, albeit only with taking into account any current Sale Star stacks.
*The extra items obtained can be different of rarities.   
**However, if this is used on an Adaptive Chest, all extra copies will match the selected item.
*Sale Star can be activated for an Adaptive Chest at two different points: when opening the chest and when selecting the item. If it is used when opening the chest, if the player who selects the item has no stacks the chest will remember the initial activator's stacks to drop multiple items. However, if the second activator has any stacks, these will determine how many items will be dropped.
*It requires 47 stacks of this item to always guarantee at least 3 drops, 114 for 4 drops, and 1980 for 5 drops. Any further stacks, however unrealistic, would have no further effect.
**These boundaries are unaffected by [[luck]]. However, {{ItemLink|itemName=57 Leaf Clover}} still has the effect that the chance for succeeding, for example, the first roll for 3 drops, ramps up more quickly even though it still attains 100% that 47 stacks. On the other hand, {{ItemLink|itemName=Purity}} has the opposite effect.
**By the time one obtains 114 stacks to guarantee at least 4 drops, the chance of getting 5 is already at 86%.
*The correct choice for the {{ArtifactLink|Delusion}} is whichever drop is picked up last. This can affect the order the items should be picked up so the most valuable item will be the one to be duplicated.
**There is a possible game-breaking sequence one should be wary of here. The 3 choices for the memory game are generated the first time the player interacts with the chest after it is reset. If the player then picks up any remaining drops belonging to that chest, they will be the correct choice. However, if this item had not already been selected in the original choice selection, the player will be stuck with 3 wrong choices.

==Math==

The number of extra drops is &lt;math&gt;2 + bonusValue&lt;/math&gt;.

If the number of stacks is 1, this value is 0.

If the number of stacks 2, it rolls up to 3 times: 

*First success chance is 30%, if successful ''bonusValue'' is set to 1 and continues with the next roll.
*Second success chance is 15%, if successful ''bonusValue'' is set to 2 and continues with the next roll.
*Third success chance is 1%, if successful ''bonusValue'' is set to 3.

For 3 stacks or higher it applies the same procedure as for 2 stacks but the chance for each roll is increased by

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{0.05x + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the amount of stacks.

[[File:Sale Star Stats.png|none|thumb|701x475px|Chance for the number of drops rewarded by a purchase.]]

==Tips==
*Since the first stack always guarantees a second item while the second stack averages to 2.35 items, in multiplayer it is more efficient to spread the stacks uniformly across the whole party.
*Since {{Color|uncommon}} and {{Color|legendary}} items can have a bigger impact compared to common items, it is recommended to use Sale Star for chests that guarantee at least {{Color|uncommon}} rarity for drops.
*Using it on an Equipment Barrel gives the player better chances to find a specific equipment they have in mind.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Sawmerang|returning]] [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, it shoots three saw blades in a fan that travel a set distance before returning to the player, each dealing 400% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and inflicting {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}. The initial shot and the return trip count as separate attacks, allowing each blade to hit twice. Additionally, after the initial strike, each saw blade deals 140% damage rapidly with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2 and inflicts Bleed each tick.

== Notes==
*{{color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of ''100% damage'' is incorrect.
*The blade projectile is not responsible for inflicting {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleed}} itself. Instead, when the enemy is struck the game checks if the attacker has Sawmerang as their active equipment and then applies the DoT. Activating this equipment with the {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} ensures the enemy will not bleed. Bleed will also not be inflicted if any of the following actions are taken while the blades are in mid-flight : 
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} using {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool}} to an equipment slot without Sawmerang.
**Giving your equipment to an [[Equipment Drone]].
**Trading your equipment with another on the ground.

==Tips== 
*Using this equipment to hit enemies at close range is risky but rewarding, as it is likely that all 3 saw blades will hit.
*Keep in mind that the saw blades do not travel through terrain, and each will immediately return upon striking terrain.
**This can be used to return the saw blades early in order to get the second hit for each blade faster, although this requires some setup.
**This also means that it's possible to get a saw blade stuck on its return trip, if the player moves such that there is geometry between them and the saw blade before it returns. When this happens, the stuck saw blade will continuously hurt any enemies near it.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Scavenger|returning]] [[Monsters#Bosses|boss monster]] in Risk of Rain 2.

Scavengers spawn with items and equipment:
* 9 {{Color|common|Common}} items, divided over 3 types.
* 4 {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} items, divided over 2 types.
* 1 {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} item.
* 1 {{Color|equipment|Equipment}}. If the Scavenger is an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]], this slot is taken up by the corresponding [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]].

Scavengers '''cannot''' get any [[:Category:AIBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] or [[Items#Void|void]] items. Any other item and equipment is possible.

When Scavengers are encountered on a stage, the first one killed will drop its bag. This bag can be opened by interacting with it, and it contains 10 items which have the same drop chance as a [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]]. Any other Scavengers killed afterwards in that stage will not drop a bag. 

The player can obtain and claim items from multiple Scavenger bags per run, as long as they are found on different stages. 

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills==
===Primary: Heavy Shotgun===
The Scavenger readies its weapon for 2.33 seconds (scales with attack speed) and then shoots 3 shotgun blasts, one every 0.4 seconds, which also scales with attack speed. Each shotgun blast contains 4 projectiles travelling at 150m/s which deal 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 2.0 in a radius of 6m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|sweet spot]] falloff. The first shotgun blast is shot directly to the front, while the other two to the left and right by 3° each.

{{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can block individual projectiles from the shotgun blasts, so they may not provide adequate protection if a blast is heading right at the player.

As the Scavenger's primary skill, this attack triggers the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shuriken}} if the Scavenger has any.

This skill has a cooldown of 6 seconds.

===Secondary: Thqwibs===
The Scavenger prepares to throw a projectile for 2 seconds (scales with attack speed), after which it throws 8 exploding Thqwibs, which travel at 40m/s and upon impact with terrain they explode dealing 400% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 10m with sweet spot falloff. Upon landing, the Thqwibs activate the on-kill effects of any item the Scavenger has, such as {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} or {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}, so even if the player avoids the projectiles' explosion, they may still be hit by secondary effects. 

Defensive Microbots can block individual Thqwibs. 

As the Scavenger's secondary skill, this skill gets extra charges if the Scavenger has {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|altText=Backup Magazines}}. 

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds.

===Utility: Scavenge Item===
The Scavenger gains 200 armor and sits down after 2 seconds. After searching for 3.5 seconds, it finds any non-blacklisted item, which broadcasts a chat message displaying what item was found, similarly to when a player obtains an item. The rarity of the item is equivalent to the rarity spread of a [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]], so the Scavenger cannot find any equipment, [[Items#Lunar|lunar]], or [[Items#Void|void]] items. The quantity of the item gained depends on its rarity: 5 for {{Color|common|common}}, 2 for {{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}, and 1 for {{Color|legendary|legendary}}. This move has an end lag of 1.5 seconds during which the Scavenger sits up again. 

As the Scavenger's utility skill, this skill gets extra charges and reduced cooldown if the Scavenger has a {{ItemLink|itemName=Hardlight Afterburner}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 19 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary and equipment''': the Scavenger must be within 80m from its target, have line of sight, equipment aim confirmation, and have less than 75% health. Both the primary and equipment have to be off cooldown. Due to health requirement, it allows players to get in close proximity to ascertain what equipment it is holding, but they must still be mindful of the nearby effects of any of the Scavenger's items.
# '''Use utility''': the Scavenger must have less than 50% and be on the ground. This means it cannot use this move while flying with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Milky Chrysalis}}.
#'''Use secondary''': the Scavenger must be within 80m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 90% health.
#'''Use primary''': the Scavenger must be within 80m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.
# '''Chase sprinting and use primary''': This behavior has no requirements and lasts for 0.8 seconds. However, due to the ''Chase'' it will never be selected.

==Tips ==
*Any items the Scavenger has equipped will be visibly represented on the Scavenger itself, though some items may be difficult to see. Players should keep their distance until they can ascertain whether or not the Scavenger's items make it particularly dangerous at close range.
*The Scavenger's footsteps are very loud, so listen for them to change tactics accordingly when one is present. They will also broadcast to the text chat when and what they scavenge from their utility skill so pay heed. The longer a scavenger exists on a stage the more dangerous it can become.
*Scavengers are ''very'' slow and will also spend a lot of time in their scavenging animation. If one is extremely dangerous or problematic, simply running away and leaving the stage is feasible.
*Although the Scavenger's shotgun attack is straightforward to understand, its 2.0 proc coefficient makes it extremely dangerous. For example, if the Scavenger has any {{ItemLink|itemName=Tri-Tip Dagger|altText=Tri-Tip Daggers}}, the shotgun will be twice as likely to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}, and the duration will be twice as long.
*Never approach a Scavenger equipped with an {{ItemLink|Unstable Tesla Coil}} or {{ItemLink|Frost Relic}}. The high damage from these items can swiftly kill any player within range.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Opinion}} can also be incredibly dangerous, spawning inescapable homing skulls at close range if the Scavenger has a method of healing, or if {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixEarth}} elites are close by.
**Scavengers with the {{ItemLink|Symbiotic Scorpion}} will decrease the player's [[armor]] when attacking. The status effect from this item will significantly increase damage taken from any source.
*Some Scavengers can be equipped with a{{ItemLink|Royal Capacitor}}, making them extremely dangerous when below 75% health. Players staying in motion can reduce the likelihood of being struck by this equipment.
*The homing missiles generated by {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} and {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}} can be difficult to avoid. Missiles will travel in a direct line towards their target without accounting for obstructions, so try to use the environment to block them.
*Having {{ItemLink|itemName=Eulogy Zero}} affects the items that Scavengers spawn with and pick up. This makes it possible for Scavengers to get extremely dangerous [[Items#Lunar|lunar items]] or [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]] like the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shaped Glass}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Glowing Meteorite}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Egocentrism}}.
*Keep in mind that Scavengers also get any items already given to monster such as from {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} which will be added on top of any items they already have.
*Scavengers will not use their equipment until they are below 75% HP.
*The Scavenger's backpack will not take into consideration the terrain when dropping items. Killing a Scavenger on a bridge or near a cliff can result in items falling off the map. It may be prudent to lure the monster to an open area before killing it.
**This may also be relevant if a Scavenger is killed by going out of bounds, e.g., falling off a cliff or flying too high in the sky with {{ItemLink|itemName=Milky Chrysalis}}, where its backpack will spawn on the nearest ground node from the Scavenger's death spot.

==Trivia==
*The "little effigy" mentioned in the logbook entry may refer to {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, since it is made of cloth and fluff and is worn and torn, which gives it its "rough around the edges" attribute. Its effects also would help a creature "be brave" due to blocking damage and is likely the strongest common item a scavenger can be given; fittingly making it extremely tanky against the "[[Survivors|strange creatures]]" mentioned.
*Up until the [[Anniversary Update]] Elite Scavengers would spawn without the corresponding affix, meaning they would simply have higher stats.
**This was the result of how Elites in the game are generated; an enemy is given hidden items to boost its stats alongside the appropriate affix as their equipment. Since scavengers already had an equipment however they couldn't receive the elite affix. This was fixed by having the affix replace their equipment slot.
*Scavenger's "Thqwibs" ability is a reference to the [[ror:Thqwib|Thqwib equipment item]] from Risk of rain, having a very similar apperance and behaviour. However it simply dealt damage, its trait of causing on-kill effects being new.
**Intriguingly, the [https://riskofrainreturns.wiki.gg/wiki/Thqwib version used in the remake] uses the same functionality of its predecessor, meaning the Thqwibs on-kill traits are seemingly something unique to the scavenger's use of them.
*If a Scavenger uses {{ItemLink|itemName=The Crowdfunder}}, it will have its money altered, which directly affects how much [[gold]] it will reward the player upon being killed. However, considering how late in a run Scavengers tend to spawn (gold reward) and the short duration they may get the opportunity to use the equipment, this is unnoticeable in the majority of cases.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' update.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Scorch Worm's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: Breach===
The Worm stops moving underground and a visual shockwave indicates that it will emerge after 1 second. Upon doing so it deals 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 5m with no [[Damage#Damage Falloff|damage falloff]] while pushing any targets upwards with a force of 3000. This attack stuns the target for 1 second.

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second and upon execution it replenishes one stock of Lava Bomb.

===Secondary: Lava Bomb===
The Worm winds its head back and after 0.3 seconds it fires a projectile which acts like {{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab|Hermit Crab's}} mortar by following the necessary arc to reach the target after 1 second. Upon impact it deals 200% damage with a 0.5 proc coefficient in a radius of 9m and sweet spot damage falloff, leaving behind a lingering spherical area of effect. This deals 20% damage with a 0.1 proc coefficient every 0.25 seconds for 6.8 seconds and inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Burn}}.

If the Worm uses this skill while burrowed, it will first execute '''Breach''' and follow it up with this attack straight after.

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds and both the original projectile and its lingering effect can be blocked by {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

===Utility: Burrow===
The Worm straightens its body up and after 1 second burrows underground. During this state it can move to chase its target while also gaining {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}}. It also removes all stocks from Lava Bomb, effectively putting it on cooldown. However, if it is already on cooldown, its timer won't be reset to the full 8 seconds.

If the Worm is moving downwards on a fairly steep incline it will leave the ground and effectively be in free fall briefly. If it does so for more than 0.2 seconds a firey shockwave can be seen appearing in its position, but this is purely visual and deals no damage.

===Behaviors===
#'''Use primary''': The Scorch Worm must be within 3m from its target and looking at it. This behavior lasts for 4 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row.
#'''Use secondary''': The Scorch Worm must be within 5m-80m from its target. This behavior lasts for 2 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row.
#'''Use utility (close)''': The Scorch Worm must be within 7.5m from its target.
#'''Use utility (far)''': The Scorch Worm must be more than 7.5m from its target. This doesn't seem to have any other differences to the previous behavior and effectively the Worm can burrow from any distance to chase a target if it can't use either its primary or secondary skills.
#'''Use utility and sprint''': The Scorch Worm must be more than 80m from its target. The previous behavior ensures this will never be selected.

==Notes==
*When the Worm emerges, it gains 1 stock of Lava Bomb. However, this does not reset the skill's cooldown, so if in the meantime it uses Lava Bomb, the cooldown will continue from whatever value it had when it emerged, thus allowing the attack to be used in quick succession.
*It is possible to make the Worm use Breach while it's not burrowed. The way to trigger this is to force the Worm to emerge and be within the appropriate distance to use its Lava Bomb. Since the Worm will stay in that behavior for 2 seconds, it will give it enough time to restock Breach. The player just needs to get within 3m to ensure Breach will be the next selected skill.
*While the lingering effect of Lava Bomb lasts for 6.8 seconds, the visual indicator disappears after 3 seconds. The player must be mindful of where the danger zone is to avoid walking into it and taking damage.
*{{Color|note|Cannot be replicated}}: Not sure if this is a bug but the Scorch Worm will randomly go invulnerable and invincible in the Simulacrum, though its health bar is still visible. It will also randomly glitch and freeze underground and will cease to continue moving at all.

==Tips==
*Since the Worm can only be damaged while unburrowed, it is in the player's best interest to force this. By walking towards and past it, the player ensures the Worm gets within distance to use Breach. If the player avoids the Worm for at least 8 seconds when burrowed, it will emerge on its own to use Lava Bomb assuming it is within the appropriate distance.
**Forcing the Worm to unburrow as soon as possible is important when it is an {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Overloading}} Elite to prevent its shields from recharging.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
* Enemy Changes
**{{MonsterLink|Scorch Worm}} HP has been reduced.
**Running over a buried Scorch Worm should now be more consistent in forcing them to come above ground.

* (Undocumented) Name and Stat Changes:

** Base Damage: 17 (+3 per level) ⇒ 20 (+4 per level)

}}

==Trivia==
*[[Patch v1.3.7]] mentions the Scorch Worm's HP being reduced, but there was no such case in the data. However, its stats were silently modified in 1.3.6 and it's likely the note was simply included in the wrong patch.

[[File:Scorched acres logbook.png|thumb|220x220px|Scorched Acres logbook diorama]]
'''Scorched Acres''' is the first new map added to the game, located on [[Petrichor V]], and is found in the third set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

Large, circular platforms make up the majority of the stage, and embers float through the air.

It has two variants, which solely alter the placement of the stage's bridges and platforms. The landmass with the crashed rescue ship may be connected to the rest of the map; if so, interactables will spawn there.

== Interactables ==
{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters==
{{MonsterList}}

==Map==
The map is comprised of many floating circular islands, which are connected by bridges and [[Launch Pads#Geysers|Geysers]].

Large mountains are also found on the outskirts of the map.

==Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and excluding the guaranteed spawn 0-2 will also spawn from the remaining ones:
#On the leftmost ledge behind the wall of the lowest circular island.
#At the very top of the (sometimes) accessible mountaintop area.
# At the very end of the path atop of the larger out-of-bounds mountaintop area (Consistent spawn).

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] that spawns on all common [[Environments]]. These small machines can turn any non-[[Items#Lunar|lunar]] or non-[[Items#Equipment|equipment]] item into scraps.

Using a Scrapper will allow the player to exchange one item stack into scraps of the corresponding rarity. Exchanging '''{{Color|#FFFFFF|Common}}''', '''{{Color|#00FF66|Uncommon}}''', '''{{Color|#FF0033|Legendary}}''' or '''{{Color|#FFFF00|Boss}}''' items will give {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, White|altText=White Item Scraps}}, {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Green|altText=Green Item Scraps}}, {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Red|altText=Red Item Scraps}}, and {{ItemLink|Item Scrap, Yellow|altText=Yellow Item Scraps}}, respectively. '''{{Color|#0066FF|Lunar}}''' and '''{{Color|#C678B4|Void}}''' items cannot be scrapped.

One item exchanged will result in one scrap. The player may choose which item they want to exchange, but they will be forced to exchange at most 10 stacks of that item at once. For example, if a player holds 5 {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} and chooses the Crowbar on the selection menu of the Scrapper, then all 5 Crowbars will be consumed simultaneously, resulting in 5 White Item Scraps. However, if a player holds 15 Crowbars and chooses the Crowbar on the selection menu of the Scrapper, then 10 Crowbars will be consumed and 5 will remain.

Scraps don't offer any passive effect when held, but they are prioritized when using [[3D Printers]] and [[Bazaar Between Time#Cauldrons|Cauldrons]]. The scraps are guaranteed to be destroyed before any other item in the player's inventory. 

''See [[Item Scrap, White]] for details.''

== Notes ==
* Scrappers will not spawn with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} active.
* Multiple Scrappers can spawn on a single stage.
* Unlike most other interactables, Scrappers do not become locked during the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]].

{{EquipmentPage|Seed of Life (Consumed)}}

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion.

Seed of Life can be actively used when there is at least one dead teammate to revive any dead players. Alternatively, it is automatically used when the player killed holds this equipment but only to revive themselves.

When used it transforms into its consumed form, which can be used to spawn a sprout on any surface the player is aiming at. The sprout spawns 10 healing orbs in 5 seconds, each healing for 2% of max health.

==Notes==
*The {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Extra Life|altText=revive}} from the [[Shrine of Shaping]] takes precedence over this equipment, which takes precedence over {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} and {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}}.
*{{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets cannot revive themselves while holding this equipment.
*{{Color|note|Bug:}} the healing orbs of the sprout can only be picked up by the player and their allies, even if a monster uses the equipment.
**The player can take advantage of this against a {{MonsterLink|Scavenger}} by standing against a wall so the sprout spawns just behind them. However, the player must be careful of the Scavenger's other explosive attacks.
*There can be only one sprout active per player. If the equipment is activated before the current sprout has expired, it will expire instantly.
*Every character lacks a display for the consumed version of the equipment.
**The Scavenger also lacks a display for Seed of Life, while for the [[Equipment Drone]] it is on top of its head, making it hard to see.
*If an Equipment Drone is killed while holding Seed of Life, it will both spawn a new broken version of itself and respawn after 2 seconds with the consumed version of the equipment.
**If the Equipment Drone is holding either Seed of Life or its consumed version, it will always use it when its owner is killed which can prevent game over in single player.
*Similar to {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}}, when Seed of Life is activated it is replaced by its consumed version before the equipment cooldown is calculated, thereby making it only 15 seconds.
*{{ItemLink|Bottled Chaos}} has a chance of using Seed of Life which can revive teammates.

==Tips==
*Giving this to an Equipment Drone allows the player to free up their equipment slot for a more active equipment while still being protected from dying since the drone will automatically revive its owner upon death. However, the trade off is that the drone itself may be killed more easily than a player who would have preferred to rely on this at a more critical moment. Note that drones are quite prone to dying to any of the final bosses.
**The consumed version of this equipment can also be quite useful as a healing source since the drone will continuously cast it every couple of seconds.
*During the final phase of the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} fight in multiplayer, after he is done taking items, if you revive any dead players prior to this, the revive players will retain their items. This is because Mithrix does not take any items from dead players during the item steal phase. This can allow you to make the final phase trivial as Mithrix is quite vulnerable during this phase.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
*(Undocumented) Now works as expected when given to an equipment drone.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.6]]
*Now works as expected when given to an equipment drone, and the consumed version can no longer teleport players out of bounds.
**{{Color|note|Correction:}} This was not fixed in this update.
----
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
* Added New Items: Seed of Life, Seed of Life (Consumed)
}}

==Trivia==
*There is an unused buff called HealAndReviveRegenBuff which increases [[Health##Health Regeneration|regen]] by 50%. The most likely point the buff was supposed to have been used is when activating Seed of Life. If this buff were to have been given to any currently alive players, it would have had some benefit both for dead and alive players, while if it were to have been given to any revived players, it would have benefited them in [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse]] due the decreased starting health.

'''Seeker''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]], unlocked by default in the {{SotS}}'''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' expansion.

Utilizing spiritual forces and tranquility, The Seeker's strength is her ability to heal - or sometimes revive - her allies, providing powerful support while also able to stand her ground against powerful enemies.

The Seeker is immediately unlockable after buying the Seekers of the Storm DLC.

* {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} stacks are obtained by successfully completing the Quick Time Event when using {{Color|seeker|Meditate}} or by successfully hitting three entities with a single {{Color|u|Palm Blast}} .
* Only 6 stacks of {{Color|u|Tranquility}} can be obtained. The 7th grants {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}}, which does not directly enhance {{Color|seeker|Seeker's}} skills; however, it boosts all stats by 7% and therefore indirectly buffs her attacks. {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} will automatically {{Keyword|u|Revive}} {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} once per stage, so long as she has reached 7th {{Color|u|Tranquility}} prior to her death.

*The third hit gains 50% more damage for each stack of {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}}, making it 600% at 6 stacks.
*The first two hits go through terrain, allowing her to hit enemies from behind cover.
*Each shot has an effective range of 54m before expiring. The final hit explodes in a 7m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]] regardless of whether it has collided with an enemy, so it can still damage nearby monsters.

* Each orb can hit 11 times before expiring, with the final hit dealing 200% damage.
** Each stack of {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} grants two more hits per orb before expiring, capping out at 23 hits.
* Each orb grants 3% barrier on hit.
** Each stack of {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} grants 1% more barrier, capping out at 9% barrier on hit.
* Up to 6 orbs can be cast at a time. Casting after reaching max stacks will spin the orbs.
** At max spin speed, the orbs deal up to +50% damage.
** Ease in: 0.5s, Boost: 3s, Ease out: 1.0s

{{SkillType|Utility|
{{Skill
| name     = Sojourn
| type     = Utility
| cooldown = 8s
| proc     = 1.0
| notes    = 
* {{Keyword|d|Stunning}}.
*After a grace period of 1.8 seconds, {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} takes 5% of her max health as damage every 0.2 seconds. This is further decreased by her natural armor and any other damage-reduction method, particularly {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}. This can make {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} flight much safer in a similar way to reducing the self-damaging effects of {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}.
**The damage is dealt relative to {{Color|seeker|Seeker's}} Base HP + Level HP, ignoring shields, barrier, or any other health-increasing items.
**If {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} ever drops below 15% of max health after the grace period, she will immediately exit {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}.
*After the grace period, the blast damage increases by 500% every second.
*The blast radius initially starts at 5m and grows hyperbolically towards 20m. Both of these values are increased by 0.5m and 1.5m respectively for each {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} stack. The final blast radius is 110% of what the previous value is at that moment in time when Seeker exits the mode.
*After the grace period, every second of flight cuts your healing by 10% until 10 seconds of flight, at which point you receive 0% healing from all sources. The game will always round it to 1, but no health is actually gained. This means that after a certain point, items that reduce, mitigate, or otherwise negate damage will be the only viable methods of extending {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}.
*While in {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}, you can not activate your [https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Items#Equipment equipment] under any circumstances (even if {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} has a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} in her inventory).
*{{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} can end prematurely if the player collides with any terrain.
* While in {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}, you are {{StatusEffectLink|SojournVehicle|immune to damage}} from most damages, even including the [[Void Fog]] and the implosion effects of {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monsters.
** Two notable exceptions to this is {{ItemLink|Warped Echo|Delayed Damage}} and the Voidling's [[Voidling#Special: Nullifier Black Hole|Nullifier Black Hole]].
** Unlike Mercenary's {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}}, this immunity also includes [[Interactables]] that cost health, such as [[Shrine of Blood]], [[Void Cradle]] and [[Void Potential]]. 
* Similar to most mobility skills, when using {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}, {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} is considered to be 'sprinting', this creates some strong synergies with certain sprint based items.
** {{ItemLink|Rose Buckler}} will reduce some of the self-inflicted damage due to the armor it grants.
** {{ItemLink|Little Disciple}} can still fire tracking wisps throughout the duration of the ability.
* {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} has a strong synergy with {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} due to the rapidly inflicted self-damage.
** This is further enhanced when using the alternate secondary skill, {{Color|seeker|Soul Spiral}}, allowing {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} to prolong the duration of {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} due to the [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] provided on each orb hit.

*The player gets 5 seconds to correctly input 5 keys. Failing an input decreases the available time by 1s and failing the entire sequence causes the skill to be put on an additional 5s cooldown, regardless of any cooldown reductions.
*Upon activation, the player is suspended in air (pausing all motion) and granted 25% of max health as barrier (not counting any shields). If the max health is lower than 115, {{Color|seeker|Seeker's}} base health, it is set to that instead. The max health value used will be referred to as ''healingValue''.
*When the inputs have been successfully completed, any allies in a 12m radius are healed by 4% of ''healingValue''. This is increased by 4% for each additional {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} stack, for a maximum of 32% at 6 stacks.
*Upon completion, monsters within a 12m radius are also hit for 450% base damage. This is increased by 200% for each additional {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} stack, for a maximum of 1650% at 6 stacks.
*Upon any successful completion of {{Color|seeker|Meditate}} after 7 stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} have been reached, any dead players are {{Color|h|Revived}}, while any living ones are granted {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}}, which boosts all stats by 7%.
**Once this effect has been used on each player, it cannot be used again until {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} completes the process anew on a subsequent stage.
**Each player can be {{Color|h|revived}} via this method once per stage. 
**A player's ability to be {{Color|h|revived}} is independent of other players.
*The color of the petals in the UI at the bottom right of the screen are a shade of transparent gold for each {{Color|u|Tranquility}} level attained. Once the 7th {{Color|u|Tranquility}} has been obtained and the power to {{Color|h|Revive}} allies and bless them with {{Color|h|Saving Grace}} has been reached, a green flash of energy in the shape of blooming Lotus Blossom petals bursts forth from {{Color|seeker|Seeker}}. {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} can be revived by her passive ability after this point, and any subsequent use of {{Color|seeker|Meditate}} will {{Color|h|Revive}} dead allies who are eligible for {{Color|h|Revive}}.
**If {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} is revived, she retains any {{Color|u|Tranquility}} stacks she had prior to death. This allows her to completely negate a team wipe by passively reviving herself, then using {{Color|seeker|Meditate}} to respawn the entire team.

== Behaviors==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented, read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.'' 

#'''Use special''': Seeker must be within 20m from an ally and be aiming at it. This behavior lasts for 2 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row. This is currently bugged and cannot be selected because the AI does not properly update whether the ally is in line of sight, even if they are.
#'''Use utility''': Seeker must be within 6m from the target. Since Seeker jumps in the air at the beginning of the attack, the direction of Sojourn will be downwards and unless the player reacts extremely quick to gain some space, it will explode shortly after.
#'''Use secondary''': Seeker must be within 30m from the target and be aiming at it.
#'''Use primary and strafe''': Seeker must be within 20m from the target.
#'''Use primary and chase''': No requirements, but due to the previous behavior it will only be selected if Seeker is at least 20m away from the target.

==Tips==  
*{{Color|seeker|Seeker}} is one of the better candidates for the {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}}, as {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}, {{Color|seeker|Soul Spiral}}, and {{Color|seeker|Meditate}} all have relatively short range, allowing for immediate and effective payoff with higher stacks.  
**Because of the aforementioned short ranges of her attacks, {{Color|seeker|Seeker}} also benefits greatly from the {{ItemLink|Frost Relic}} and {{ItemLink|Unstable Tesla Coil}}, which when paired with the Focus Crystal can deliver high amounts of damage at short ranges.
*{{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} pairs great with {{Color|seeker|Unseen Hand}}, allowing for a large amount of enemies to be hit; this is enhanced with the {{ArtifactLink|Kin}}, {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}}, and {{ArtifactLink|Soul}} where multiple weak enemies can be present. 
** Additionally, {{Color|seeker|Unseen Hand}} will always trigger {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, allowing for even more potential AoE damage.
*The movement speed while using {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} is not affected by movement speed items. Instead it is based on your current health, moving faster at full health and slower at low health.
*Due to the way {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} calculates damage taken, HP-increasing items, such as {{ItemLink|Infusion}} and {{ItemLink|Bison Steak}}, are particularly useful as they can extend the amount of time you can spend during flight while taking the same amount of damage. 
**{{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}} should be avoided, as it will greatly reduce the length of time you can continuously use {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} (the damage you take is the exact same, but your HP is halved).
**{{ItemLink|Transcendence}} in particular causes the ability to end as soon as the 1.8s grace period is up, due to the 1hp meeting the automatic ability end threshold.
*Items such as {{ItemLink|Razorwire}}, {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}}, {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}, and {{ItemLink|Planula}} synergize very well with the {{Color|seeker|Sojourn's}} self-damaging ability, as they let her deal more damage while taking less.
**Taking less damage is more important than healing here because {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} ends when reaching a low health threshold (15% of survivor hp), so prolonging the duration of the skill allows to make use of its mobility for longer, as well as build up more damage which is dealt when exiting the state.
***Since healing is reduced by 10% every second, all healing sources eventually have no effect and damage reduction becomes the only method to further extend the flight duration.
*Since {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} ignores all sources of damage, one can use it to fly through a [[Shrine of Blood]], for example, and activate it in-mid flight to negate its health cost. 
**The same can be done for [[Void Cradle|Void Cradles]], which can also be timed to exit {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} as soon as any {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}} come out to instantly kill them.
*{{Color|seeker|Seeker}} should avoid using {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.}}, as the gummy Seeker spawned from it tends to use {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} for far longer than it should, resulting in it dying far faster than it does on other survivors.
*Seeker's {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} synergizes quite well with her {{Color|seeker|Soul Spiral}}, as they do not expire upon entering {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}. If done skillfully enough, the player can effectively remain in {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} so long as {{Color|seeker|Soul Spiral's}} orbs are present, as the barrier production outspeeds the damage intake from {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}}.
*It is important to use {{Color|seeker|Meditate}} as soon as it is on cooldown since {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} can massively enhance her damage, while {{StatusEffectLink|Saving Grace}} can also act as a single-use {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}} once per stage.

==Sojourn vs Repulsion Armor Plate==
The following table details (in two columns) the number of {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} stacks needed to mitigate {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} damage to the minimum value of 1 and below the 2.5% {{StatusEffectLink|Permanent Curse}} threshold of [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 8]] respectively. This assumes no other armor- and health-modifying factors other than Seeker's natural 20 armor are in play.

Keep in mind some of these stack amounts can be slightly superfluous, for example at Level 2 {{Color|seeker|Sojourn}} deals 1.21 damage per tick with 1 stack, so obtaining a second repulsion armor plate to only mitigate 0.21 damage per tick leads to a reduction overkill. However at Level 4 where it deals ~9 damage, the second stack almost gains full value.

;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
*Seeker
**Added alternate abilities {{SkillLink|Reprieve}} and {{SkillLink|Palm Blast}}, including Unlock [[Challenges]].
**Any successful {{SkillLink|Meditate}} from the 7th stack onwards will now revive teammates in multiplayer (previously it was only the 7th stack.)
**Can now self-revive once 7 stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|Tranquility}} are achieved.
**Increased range of Meditation Explosion by 2m per Tranquility Stack.
**{{SkillLink|Sojourn|altText=Sojourn's}} cooldown has been slightly reduced from 9 seconds to 8 seconds.

----
;[[Patch v1.3.5]]
*As a connected client, some players reported that {{SurvivorLink|Seeker|Seeker’s}} {{SkillLink|Spirit Punch}} had a chance to collide twice with the enemy and deal double damage. That has now been addressed.
*Resolved an issue were using {{SkillLink|Sojourn}}, {{ItemLink|Eccentric Vase}}, or {{ItemLink|Volcanic Egg}} could lock you out of viewing the {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|False Son}} fight into or teleporting up to the platform.
----
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]

'''Seekers of the Storm''' is the second expansion for Risk of Rain 2. It introduces a new antagonist, the False Son, as well as new [[Survivors]], [[items]], and six new [[environments]].&lt;ref&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/ Steam page for Seekers of the Storm&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Survivors of the Void]], only one player in a multiplayer lobby will need to own the expansion for all players to access its content (excluding Survivors and unlocks),

Prior to its official reveal in the Festival of Gup showcase&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD6OqI1On4Y The Festival of Gup&lt;/ref&gt; on November 8, 2023, the expansion was titled "'''EXXXXXXX-X'''" on the Steam store and a patch was released for Risk of Rain 2 on November 6 which added blue comets to various stages. Later on August 27th, 2024, it would be released.

==Description==
'''A False Savior'''

Bring retribution to Petrichor V and forge a path to the Colossus to face an ancient threat!


A Soul, born without purpose, locked away and forgotten. The prison was both her sanctuary and shackle. Her fate: doomed by her flawless design. Millennia passed. Her desperation grew, and from the depths of her solitude, she brought another into the world she lost. Now, The False Son walks Petrichor V, bound by the betrayal of his forebearer and the corruption of a King’s blind ambition.


Only one player is required to own Seekers of the Storm to enable the expansion for the whole lobby. Players without Seekers of the Storm will be unable to select the new survivors or permanently unlock new items, logbooks, or other content.


'''Conquer the Path of the Colossus'''

Prepare for an expedition deep into Petrichor V’s lost regions! Ancient Lemurian temples and crashing waterfalls lead the way across new stages. Explore the caverns and take in the suspicious smell of strawberries in [REDACTED]. Fend off scores of Lemurians within their Reformed Altar. Or drop into the lush green canopy of the Treeborn Colony.


But the true threat towers overhead… Travel the path of the Colossus and ascend its levels in a race to confront The False Son. Defeat him and unlock the true power of his Soul!

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder damages an enemy, there is a 20% chance (''+20% per stack'') that a burst of hooks will shoot out from that enemy, pulling in up to 10 other enemies (''+5 per stack'') within 30m and dealing 100% [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|total damage]] to each.

Each hook has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.33.

This item stacks [[Item Stacking#Hyperbolic Stacking|hyperbolically]] in the chance to fire hooks, and [[Item Stacking#Linear Stacking|linearly]] in the number of hooked enemies.

== Math ==
The chance to activate is determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;1 - 1 / (1 + 0.2 \bullet x)&lt;/math&gt;, with ''x'' being the amount of Sentient Meat Hooks.

== Tips ==
* Similarly to the {{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}}, this item is useful for gathering up many enemies into one spot to strike them all with area-of-effect items or abilities. 
* Because a large number of enemies are hooked at once, it is possible for just a single activation of the Sentient Meat Hook to activate other total damage items easily, even though its own proc coefficient is low.
* Due to the hyperbolic stacking, a single Sentient Meat Hook will activate more frequently when stacked with {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover|altText=57 Leaf Clovers}} than additional stacks of Sentient Meat Hook. Unlike additional stacks of Sentient Meat Hooks, 57 Leaf Clovers do not boost the number of enemies the item can hook, but this is often outweighed by the increased activation of other chance-based items.
**To get an even higher chance, you can get more meat hooks along with clovers.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

The holder's base damage is doubled (''x2 per stack''), but in exchange, their total maximum health is ''halved'' (''x0.5 per stack''). Both these effects stack exponentially, meaning that stacking Shaped Glass will dramatically increase damage but reduce the holder's health to nearly nothing.

== Notes ==

* The main drawback of Shaped Glass is the removal of [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]], meaning the player is always in danger of dying from a single attack. Strong-hitting enemies like the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Stone Golem}} become more threatening when holding this item.
** Due to this effect, having both a Shaped Glass and a {{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} will restore your maximum health to normal, but you will not get your [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]] back.
* Barrier items like the {{ItemLink|itemName=Topaz Brooch}} pair well with Shaped Glass, as barrier decays slower with lower maximum health and provides much-needed survivability.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate}} are invaluable items to use with Shaped Glass. The Armor Plate mitigates damage-over-time effects such as{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire}}, and attacks from light-hitting enemies like the{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Lesser Wisp}}. 
* Tougher Times's [[Items#Void|void counterpart]], {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}, may prove more reliable than its uncorrupted version, as it is guaranteed to block a hit. The {{ItemLink|itemName=Oddly-shaped Opal}} provides a similar benefit, drastically reducing the damage from a single hit. However, players must be aware of these items' cooldowns.
* Fixed damage, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Opinion}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}}, is ''not'' increased by the Shaped Glass, since these items do not use the [[Survivors|Survivor's]] base damage stat.
** This also means that any [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] items activated by these sources, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Ukulele}}, are not increased by the Shaped Glass.
* Due to the limits of the floating-point number system, Shaped Glass has a stacking limit of 127. When holding 128 or more, the holder's health rounds to 0 and they immediately die.

== Math ==
The damage is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;damage &amp;sdot; 2 ^ amount&lt;/code&gt;

The maximum health is determined by the formula &lt;code&gt;health &amp;sdot; 0.5 ^ amount&lt;/code&gt;

* Gameplay Changes
** 🌧Add special death message for dying while carrying Shaped Glass
}}

== Trivia ==
* Prior to the ''1.0'' Update, one-shot protection was unaffected by Shaped Glass, but now Shaped Glass removes the player's one-shot protection entirely.
* Obtaining Shaped Glass does not cause the player to take damage, despite the health bar's red animation.
* Shaped Glass may be based upon Rupert's Glass, a strange phenomena where a droplet shaped piece of glass is borderline invulnerable from one side, but absolutely vulnerable on the other.
* Dying while holding Shaped Glass results in a unique death animation, where the player's Survivor shatters into shards of glass. Additionally, the death message while holding Shaped Glass is unique, displaying "You have shattered into innumerable pieces."
** This animation is identical to the one used when the player obliterates themself at the [[A Moment, Fractured#Obelisk|Obelisk]] in [[A Moment, Fractured]]. However, the character's model will ragdoll as if they died normally for a moment before shattering.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]]. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}} [[Monsters#Perfected|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Perfected Elite, but this chance is affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with the Shared Design gains the powers of a Perfected Elite: 

* Their attacks{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cripple}} enemies. 
* Every 10 seconds in combat, they fire 4 bombs dealing 30% damage each. 
* They get +30% [[Movement Speed|movement speed]].  
* They gain 25% maximum health, but have all but 1 of their health replaced with [[Health#Shield|shields]], similar to {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}. 

Although the Shared Design is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|alt=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

== Notes ==
* Converting all health into shields that cannot be healed normally is not to be undertaken lightly. See {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} for an exhaustive list of effects.
* Giving the Shared Design to an {{EntityLink|entityName=Equipment Drone}} can be very helpful, since it can damage and Cripple enemies, and the player will not have to replace all their health.
** Equipment Drones do not spawn on {{EntityLink|entityName=Commencement}}, so the player must repair one and bring it with them to Commencement, then allow it to be destroyed. After this, they must give it the Shared Design when obtained.
** Alternatively, the Shared Design can drop during a Lunar Chimera [[Family Events|Family Event]] on [[Sky Meadow]]s after stage 6, making it possible (albeit extremely unlikely) to give it to an Equipment Drone before heading to Commencement.

== Trivia ==
* {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}} are the only [[Survivors]] who do not have the glowing halo of a Perfected Elite while they are Perfected.
* This equipment can be exploited by {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} when paired with the ability {{SkillLink|skillName=Retool}}. Damage taken without the Shared Design can be recovered when switching to this equipment and back again. (Last tested V1.2.4.1)
** This is also the case with {{EntityLink|entityName=Silence Between Two Strikes}}.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Shattering Justice|returning]] item introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''.

Upon hitting an enemy 5 times, that enemy receives the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Pulverized}} debuff for 8 seconds (''+8 seconds per stack''), which reduces their [[armor]] by 60 points. Since most enemies don't have any or have very little armor, this item usually sets their armor to a negative value.

The build-up effect, a stacking debuff known as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PulverizeBuildup}}, lasts for 2 seconds, multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the hit. Once Pulverize Buildup has stacked 5 times, all buildup stacks are removed, Pulverized is applied, and that enemy cannot receive more buildup debuffs. Because the duration of the build-up is affected by the proc coefficient, [[Damage|damage-over-time]] effects like the {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}} do not put any build-up on enemies.

== Notes ==
* This item can be seen as a mostly consistent damage buff for almost all characters, as the way the game calculates damage through armor also accounts for negative armor and greatly increases damage accordingly. The value is approximately 38% more damage for normal monsters and about 55% more for average bosses (depending on their armor).

== Tips ==
* The Shattering Justice pairs well with the {{ItemLink|Death Mark}}, since Pulverized and Pulverize Buildup both count towards getting even more bonus damage from the Death Mark.
** Note that Pulverized and Pulverize Buildup are mutually exclusive, so an enemy cannot be afflicted with both at once.
* In multiplayer, it is wise to give this item to the player with the highest attack speed whenever it appears, as the debuff is applied after 5 hits from ''any ability'' regardless of its damage. This means Shattering Justice is best on {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} with {{SkillLink|Phase Blast|Commando}} or {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}, as the 8 shots fired by both will instantly cause an enemy to be affected by the debuff, allowing the rest of the team to focus on the afflicted monster for serious damage.
** Conversely, this item is weaker on {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, since her slow base attack speed combined with her focus on her utility skill makes it difficult to apply the debuff without going out of her way to apply extra hits.
*** A critical hit from {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} with {{SkillLink|Flurry|Huntress}} can also apply the debuff, since it fires 6 projectiles.
*** Any attack from {{SurvivorLink|Captain|Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Vulcan Shotgun|Captain}} that lands at least five bullets will also instantly apply the debuff.
*** {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} using {{SkillLink|Burst|Bandit}} can instantly activate the debuff if all five bullets hit.
*** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} with {{SkillLink|skillName=Auto-Nailgun|survivorName=MUL-T}} can rapidly reach 5 stacks of buildup, especially when using {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode|survivorName=MUL-T}}. However, this is somewhat less effective against long-range targets due to damage falloff.
**** {{SkillLink|skillName=Power-Saw|survivorName=}} can also build up 5 stacks easily, but only against nearby targets.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Imp Overlord}}. 

The player gains 5% critical strike chance, and all critical strikes will inflict {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding}} on enemies. Additionally, any enemy that dies while bleeding will explode, inflicting 400% (''+400% per stack'') damage plus 15% (''+15% per stack'') of its maximum health to nearby enemies within 16m.

== Notes ==
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description does not specify the +5% critical strike chance.
* The Bleed applied by the Shatterspleen is the same as the Bleed inflicted by the{{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}; if both items are held, only one instance of bleed can be applied at a time.
* Corrupting any Tri-Tip Daggers into {{ItemLink|Needletick|Needleticks}} will not replace the Bleed from Shatterspleen with {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Fracture}}.
* When paired with the {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD|altText=Ocular HUD’s}} effect, all damage the player deals will stack Bleed for the duration.

* If the target is killed in one shot by a critical hit, it will ''not'' explode, since it dies before any Bleed is applied to it.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

When entering a new stage, if any player has this item, a [[Chests#Crashed Multishop "Delivery"|Crashed Multishop "Delivery"]] will spawn somewhere in the stage (one per player who has a Shipping Request Form). The "delivery" is a burning Multishop Terminal which is different from a normal one in a few ways: it costs ''no'' [[gold]] to use, it has only 2 choices instead of the usual 3, and one of those 2 choices is a question mark icon (meaning the item of that rarity is unknown).

== Notes ==
* The crashed Multishop will never display any [[Items#Equipment|equipment]].
* Terminals spawn even when the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice|Artifact of Sacrifice}} is active.
* Giving a '''Shipping Request Form'''  to a Lemurian Egg (See [[Artifacts|Artifact Of Devotion]]) causes every lemurian spawned to have one as well, leading to a multishop terminal in every stage dependent on the amount of living lemurians.

==Math ==
The weight for each tier of item is calculated as follows:
*&lt;code&gt;.79&lt;/code&gt; for [[Items#Common|{{Color|common|common}}]]
*&lt;code&gt;.2 * n&lt;/code&gt; for [[Items#Uncommon|{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}]]
*&lt;code&gt;.01 * n^2&lt;/code&gt; for [[Items#Legendary|{{Color|legendary|legendary}}]]

Where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the amount of Shipping Request Form.

To calculate the chance for a tier, add together all weights then divide that tier's weight by the total sum of all weights.

For example, if a player has 2 Shipping Request Form items, then the weights are 0.79 (common), 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 (uncommon), 0.01 * 2^2 = 0.04 (legendary). Then, the chance an item is legendary is 0.04 / (0.79 + 0.4 + 0.04) = 0.04 / 1.23, or approximately 0.0325, around 3%.

The table below shows the probabilities calculates for each value of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. Note however that each delivery includes 2 choices. See [[#At least 1 Legendary|the section below for odds of at least one legendary.]]

==Graph==

[[File:Shipping Request Form Stats.png|none|thumb|715x547px|Chance for an item in a Crashed Shipping Delivery to be of a given tier. The amount is the amount of Shipping Request Forms a player has.]]

==At least 1 Legendary==

Each item tier is independent of each other, but each delivery drop contains 2 items. You can calculate the probability of getting ''at least'' one item from a tier by using the complement: &lt;code&gt;1 - (1 - x) ^ 2&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is the probability of getting at least one that tier (shown above).

For example, with a stack of 3, the chance of one item being chosen as legendary is 6% = 0.06. The chance that it is ''not'' legendary is &lt;code&gt;1 - 0.06&lt;/code&gt;, so the chance that ''both'' are not legendary is &lt;code&gt;(1 - 0.06)^2&lt;/code&gt;. The complement of this is the chance that at least one is legendary: &lt;code&gt; 1 - (1 - .06)^2&lt;/code&gt;, roughly 11.5%.

The table below shows the probability that at least one {{Color|legendary|legendary}} item will appear a given stack of Shipping Request Form.

==Tips ==
*Having the {{ItemLink|Executive Card}} allows the player to obtain both items from the delivery, instead of choosing one over another.
**This is even more effective in multiplayer when multiple players have Shipping Request Forms; the player with the Executive Card can open each of the other players' deliveries for them.
*Using the {{ItemLink|Radar Scanner}} allows the player to find the [[Chests#Crashed Multishop "Delivery"|Crashed Multishop "Delivery"]] faster, as it will be represented as two adjacent chest icons ([[File:InventoryIconOutlined.png|24px]]) upon scan.
*In multiplayer, all stacks of Shipping Request Form from every player will increase the item rarity of each Multishop spawned from this item. For example, if a player has 5 stacks of this item while another player has 1, both multishops that spawn from the two players holding it will have the item rarity of having 6 Shipping Request Form. So it is not advised for one person in multiplayer to horde all the Shipping Request Forms, as you lose out on more loot.

The '''Shrine of Blood''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. Upon activation, the player will sacrifice a percentage of their HP to receive [[gold]]. Generated gold is equal to half of the HP taken (e.g. 50 HP yields 25 gold). Upon purchase the HP cost is scaled by &lt;math&gt;(1 - cost)^2&lt;/math&gt; and it can be purchased up to 3 times.

! HP Cost
|-
| First
| 50%
|-
| Second

|-
| Third
| 93%
|}

== Notes ==
* [[Health#Shield|Shields]] count as health for the cost requirement and gold received. For instance, a player with 100 health and 20 shield will take 60 damage when using a Shrine of Blood for the first time, gaining 30 gold.
*Having [[Health#Barrier|barriers]] will not increase the amount of health taken, but it will still be depleted before shields and health. Following the above example, a player with 100 health, 20 shield, and 120 barrier (the maximum possible in this example) will take 60 damage and lose 60 barrier. If the player can reliably generate barriers, they can use Shrines of Blood consecutively very quickly without much risk.

* {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, as well as its void counterpart, {{ItemLink|Safer Spaces}}, can block incoming damage from the Shrine of Blood. Gold is still awarded when the damage is negated.

* Damage dealt by the Shrine will cause the {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}} to take the player's gold.
** The amount of gold received will not be part of the gold lost due to the downside.
*** For example, if a player has 1 Brittle Crown, 100 health, and 100 gold, using the Shrine of Blood once will leave the player with 75 gold. 50 gold was lost for taking 50% damage, but 25 gold was still gained for losing 50 health.

* Shrines of Blood deal damage based on maximum health ''after'' any health reduction from curses, so it is possible to use them even while under the effects of{{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction|altText=Tonic Afflictions}}, and/or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PermanentCurse}} on {{entityLink|Eclipse8|Eclipse 8|Eclipse#Eclipse 8}}.
*The third use will only deal 90% damage due to [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]], but the player must still have at least 93% current health to activate the Shrine.
**However, if the player has Shaped Glass, the Artifact of Glass, 3+ Tonic Afflictions, or 11+ Permanent Curse stacks, they will lose one-shot-protection and the shrine will deal the full 93% damage to them.

* When the player interacts with a charged [[Teleporter]] or a [[Interactables#Portals|Portal]], the player's gold is converted into experience over 4.5 seconds. The teleportation sequence then starts, which lasts for about 2 seconds. If a Shrine of Blood is used during that part, the gold gain won't be lost and will be kept for the next stage. The best cue for the initiation of the teleportation sequence is the survivor glowing white. If any gold is gained during the money to EXP conversion phase, that phase will be extended until all gold is used up so it is important to not do this trick too early.&lt;ref&gt;https://youtu.be/h-C5D2lbjy4&lt;/ref&gt;
**Keeping gold for the next stage can also be achieved in the same time window by killing an enemy or picking up gold nuggets dropped from {{ItemLink|itemName=Ghor's Tome}}.

* Avoid using Shrines of Blood while equipped with a {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}, as even the first purchase, costing 50% HP, is sufficient to trigger the explosion.
**However, if one uses a Shrine of Blood less than 2 seconds before teleporting out (see note from above), the explosion will be interrupted and the player will get to keep both the equipment and the gold for the next stage.

* Shrines of Blood will not spawn in {{EntityLink|entityName=Abyssal Depths}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}, presumably because they provide an easy way to gain gold to open the guaranteed [[Legendary Chest]]. &lt;!-- Is this note really relevant? Said environments have Shrines of Combat, which provide similar income boosts. --&gt;
*Since the gold gained is linked to the player's health, Shrines of Blood become useless (and very risky for little reward) the longer the run goes. This is because the player's [[level]] scales logarithmically, but the gold dropped by killing enemies scales exponentially (see [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|scaling difficulty]]).

The '''Shrine of Chance''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is shaped like a {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem}}. Upon purchase, the player will have a chance to receive an [[Items|item]] of a random rarity or a random equipment.

The base cost is $17, increasing by 40% with each activation. Receiving two items from a Shrine of Chance will prevent any further interaction with it. However, until both items are obtained, there is no limit—save the amount of gold in the player's possession—to the number of times a Shrine of Chance can be activated.

==Notes==
* The first use of a Shrine of Chance is less expensive than a small chest, making it a cheap way to obtain items if lucky.
* Failing a Shrine of Chance three times in a row will complete the [["Is This Bugged?"]] Challenge.
* The chance to receive an item is '''not''' affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} or {{ItemLink|Purity}}.
* Shrines of Chance cannot spawn on {{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}}.
*Shrines of Chance will not spawn if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is active.

==Math==
The possible chains of independent random binary events where termination occurs after two successes can be represented as a tree &lt;math&gt; T_2 &lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;T_2 = (T_2, T_1);\text{ } T_1 = (T_1, T_0);\text{ } T_0 = () &lt;/math&gt;

The expected cost of getting 2 items out of a Shrine of Chance is then &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;C_0 = 0;\text{ } C_1 = 0.55(1 + 1.4C_0) + 0.45(1 + 1.4C_1);\text{ } C_2 = 0.55(1 + 1.4C_1) + 0.45(1 + 1.4C_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; here represents the expected cost of getting &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; items out of a Shrine of Chance as a multiple of the current cost of activating the shrine. Successive simplification gives

&lt;math&gt;C_0 = 0;\text{ } C_1 = \frac{100}{37} \approx 2.7;\text{ } C_2 = \frac{11400}{1369} \approx 8.3&lt;/math&gt;

This means that getting one item out of an unused Shrine of Chance is initially expected to be about 1.8 times as expensive as a small chest for a slightly rarer reward on average; emptying a Shrine of Chance costs on average about 1.5 times as much as opening two large chests for a more common reward.

The '''Shrine of Combat''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. It resembles an alien head on a plate. Upon activation, it spawns a group of a [[Monsters|monster]] found in the current [[Environments|Environment]]. 

Completing three of these in the same stage will complete the [[Warmonger]] challenge, unlocking the {{ItemLink|War Horn}}.

''See also: [[Directors]]''

==Environments==
* [[Titanic Plains]]
* [[Abandoned Aqueduct]]
* [[Rallypoint Delta]]
* [[Sundered Grove]]
* [[Abyssal Depths]]
* [[Sky Meadow]]

==Tips==
* These shrines are useful in the early game to easily gather [[gold]], but can become risky after [[Environments#Looping|looping]] since multiple Malachite and Celestine [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]] can spawn from one.
* Shrines of Combat always spawn enemies based on what the ambient difficulty was when entering the current stage, not the difficulty when the Shrines are activated.

The '''Shrine of Order''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is a rare Shrine that can only be found on [[Rallypoint Delta]] and [[Commencement]].

Upon donating a [[Lunar Coins|Lunar Coin]], the following process is applied to the player's items:
# For a given item rarity tier ({{Color|common|Common}}, {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}, {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}, {{Color|boss|Boss}}, {{Color|void|Void}} or {{Color|lunar|Lunar}}), an item in the player's possession is randomly selected.
#All the other items of that rarity tier become that selected item, leaving only one stack of the same item.

The process is repeated separately for each rarity tier.

==Notes==

*It is important to note that the chance of one item to be selected is evenly distributed between each ''type'' of item in the possession of the player, regardless of the quantity of each item held. For instance, if a player has 20 {{ItemLink|Medkit|altText=Medkits}} and 1 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}, using the Shrine of Order will give a 50% chance for them to end up with 21 Medkits, and a 50% chance to end up with 21 Syringes.
* This Shrine does not affect hidden items like [[DrizzlePlayerHelper]] or items without a given rarity tier like {{itemLink|Tonic Affliction|Tonic Afflictions|altUrl=Spinel Tonic#Tonic Affliction}}.
*One Shrine of Order is guaranteed to spawn on {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement|altUrl=Commencement#Shrine of Order}}.
*[[Item Scrap, White|Scraps]] are considered normal items of their respective rarity tier. If a player holds any scraps, using a Shrine of Order has a chance to convert all their items of that rarity into scraps.
*Shrines of Order can convert {{ItemLink|Pearl|Pearls}} into {{ItemLink|Irradiant Pearl|Irradiant Pearls}}, granting a huge boost in stats. However, it can also convert Irradiant Pearls into regular Pearls.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' expansion. It is much taller than other shrines, resembling an obelisk with a cauldron at its base.

It can only be encountered on {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} by defeating {{MonsterLink|False Son (Boss)|False Son}} and then offering an item to it, which instantly ends the run. The offered will be available at the beginning of the next run when the {{ArtifactLink|Rebirth}} is enabled.

By interacting with it once, the [[Prime Meridian#Destination Portal|Destination Portal]] appears to its right, which instead allows the player to travel to {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} and continue their run.

==Notes==
*While the majority of the other [[Artifacts]] require finding a code somewhere hidden in an Environment and then completing a trial in {{EnvironmentLink|envName=Bulwark's Ambry}} in order to be unlocked, the Artifact of Rebirth has no such code and is instead unlocked by offering an item to it for the first time.
*Even activating the Destination Portal first and then offering an item to the shrine just before the player has teleported out will end the run instead of advancing to Helminth Hatchery.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the [[Interactables#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the [[Seekers of the Storm]] expansion.

Upon activation, it gives the {{StatusEffectLink|Immune}} buff for 3 seconds, takes away 30% of max [[Health]] of any alive players in a [[Health#Curse|Curse]] style and gives an extra life. Both the Curse and the extra life are indicated by the {{StatusEffectLink|Soul Cost}} and {{StatusEffectLink|Extra Life}} buffs, which are temporary effects and go away when the player respawns by any means. If any players are dead during the shrine's activation they are revived instead.

There can be only up to one Shrine of Shaping spawned in a stage at any given point, which upon activation becomes inactive.

==Notes==
*The Extra Life buff takes precedence over consuming any {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}}, or {{ItemLink|itemName=Seed of Life}} since it would be removed upon respawning anyway.
**However, if a player has just died and is set to be revived by any of the aforementioned items or equipment, activating the shrine in the meantime will '''not''' instantly revive the player and prevent their consumption.
*While the shrine has a collision and players can not go through it, attacks and projectiles are not blocked by it.

==Tips==
*Activating the shrine whenever encountering it makes sense as it is another form of preventing a game over, or conserving other revival consumables.
*Similarly, waiting to activate it after the [[Teleporter|Teleporter Event]] in multiplayer can be of strategic significance to ensure all players can benefit from the boss drops.
*A timely activation of the shrine can prevent damage from a [[Shrine of Blood]], [[Void Cradle]], or a [[Void Potential]] due to the Immune buff.

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
*Added new Shrine: Shrine of Shaping
}}

==Trivia==
*While the Extra Life buff is stackable, it is impossible to stack it without mods as there cannot be multiple shrines in a stage.
**Notably, if one were to activate multiple shrines, Soul Cost would not stack. Additionally, multiple stacks of Extra Life would have no further impact as they are all removed when the player respawns.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the [[Interactables#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. Upon activation, the difficulty of the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] will be increased by spawning additional bosses, turning bosses into [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]], and/or spawning more difficult bosses. Upon defeating all the bosses, the players will be rewarded with an additional copy of each item dropped by the Teleporter. 

Activating multiple Shrines of the Mountain will increase the boss difficulty even further but will also reward the players with even more items. The number of items dropped by the Teleporter is equal to &lt;code&gt;number of players &amp;sdot; (1 + number of activated shrines)&lt;/code&gt;.

All the items rewarded are the same. However, if a boss can drop [[Items#Boss|boss items]], the random chance to replace a reward with a boss item is rolled for each extra item dropped as well. This makes tackling the challenge of the Mountain an excellent way to obtain boss items.

== Notes ==

* Technically speaking, the Shrine of the Mountain gives the Teleporter Boss [[Directors|director]] 100% more credits per activation. This is why a Teleporter Boss consisting of multiple bosses may be replaced with a few Elites or even higher-tier bosses, since the director can now afford those more expensive options. 
** For instance, if the director originally only had exactly enough credits to spawn one {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Imp Overlord}} (800 credits), but the player has activated 5 Shrines of the Mountain (giving the director a total of 4800 credits), it might spawn a single {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Overloading Worm}} as the Teleporter Boss instead of 6 Imp Overlords, or it might spawn a single tier 1 Elite Imp Overlord instead. 
* Shrines of the Mountain never spawn on the third stage of a loop, i.e. {{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}, or {{EnvironmentLink|Sulfur Pools}}.
* The inspiration of the shrine of the mountain comes from when Paul Morse was walking his dog up a hill and his dog "Ran all the way up like I was holding a treat at the top" and as it came back down an almost identical dog followed and Paul had the though "What if you go to the boss expecting one and get two?" although this feature was later changed from originally being a random chance to a shrine.

The '''Shrine of the Woods''' is one of the [[Interactibles#Shrines|Shrines]] in Risk of Rain 2. Upon purchase, it will create a circular field on the ground around it that heals all allies.

The base cost is $25, increased by 50% for each upgrade. Upgrading the Shrine with additional [[Gold]] will increase its area of effect. It can be upgraded up to two times after the initial purchase.

The healing effect is similar to the {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}, the differences being a higher frequency of the healing ticks but a lower amount of HP restored per tick.

*[[Distant Roost]]

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

The item grants the {{StatusEffectLink|PrimarySkillShuriken}} buff, which stacks up to 3 (''+1 per stack'') times over 10 seconds. When the holder's primary skill is used, a shuriken projectile is launched forward at the same time, dealing 400% (''+100% per stack'') damage with a 1.0 [[Proc Coefficient]] and consuming one stack of the Shuriken buff.

== Notes ==
* The projectiles curve, making it difficult to hit enemies at longer ranges.
* Technically, the trigger to throw a shuriken is pressing the primary attack input, not necessarily just using a primary skill. As a result, non-primary skills that use the primary input will also throw Shurikens. This means that {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}} will always activate the Shuriken when shooting, as her other skills simply change the effect of her primary. The same applies when aiming {{SurvivorLink|Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Orbital Probe}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}}, and when firing {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Thermal Harpoons}}. 

== Math ==
The charge cooldown is determined by the formula &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{10}{(amount + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Tips==
* Shurikens on melee-based characters like {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} or {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} can give them a ranged attack while activating their primary.
**However, {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} does not gain barrier from Shurikens, as her passive only affects her gauntlets.
**Shurikens on {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} are harder to utilize, as they activate as soon as he charges his primary, rather than when he releases the shot.
**The lock-on attacks for {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} can activate Shurikens, but will only work with a target in sight.
*A single stack of Shurikens deals enough damage to activate the {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band|Kjaro's}}, {{ItemLink|Runald's Band|Runald's}}, and {{ItemLink|Singularity Band|Singularity Bands}}, allowing characters such as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} and {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} to more consistently activate them. Conversely, characters with strong single-hit skills can lose out on damage output if Shurikens activate bands instead. 
**Notably, Engineer's turrets can use Shurikens with their attack, allowing them to use the Bands as well.
* The damage dealt by firing all the max number of Shurikens can be found with the following equation &lt;math&gt;D=(x+2)(x+300%)=x^2+5x+6&lt;/math&gt; where x is the number of stacks of the item you have. This quadratic equation means that stacking many Shurikens can become very powerful.
** Stacking low amounts of Shurikens can create temporary diminishing returns, as the first stack adds 1200%, the second stack adds 800%, the third stack adds 1000%, the fourth stack adds 1200%, then every stack after that adds more than the first stack. Out of all stacks of Shurikens, the second and third stacks add the least damage.
*Shurikens are extremely dangerous if monsters gain them (such as in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}, with the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} enabled, or if the monster is a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}} or the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=final boss}}), as they deal large amounts of damage and are difficult to avoid due to their high velocity. If the monsters also have Kjaro's or Runald's Band, even a single shuriken can kill the player.

The '''Silence Between Two Strikes''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from an {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} [[Monsters#Overloading|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Overloading Elite, but this chance is affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with the Silence Between Two Strikes gains the power of an Overloading Elite; 50% of their health is replaced by [[Health#Shield|shields]], and their attacks attach lightning bombs to enemies, which explode after a brief pause dealing 50% [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]]. The bombs do not have a proc coefficient. 

Although the Silence Between Two Strikes is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated.  Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

== Notes ==

* The 50% shield is gained when picking up the Silence Between Two Strikes, regardless of the player's current health. For instance, while a player at full health will immediately lose half of their health and have it replaced with shields, a player at 1 health out of 300 total will simply gain 150 shield points instantly.
* While this equipment gives an effective 50% boost to damage output, converting half of the holder's health into shields can be a nuisance. Shields cannot be healed through normal means and only replenish after avoiding damage for 7 seconds, so players who take damage frequently will virtually always be at half health.
** This is very important to keep in mind while playing as {{SurvivorLink|REX}}.
* This equipment has no passive shield effect if the survivor has a {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} in their inventory. 

== Trivia ==
* The name refers to the silence between lightning striking and hearing thunder. This name is further reflected by the lightning bombs (the silence between the player landing a hit, and the bomb exploding).
* This equipment can be exploited by {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} when paired with the ability {{SkillLink|Retool|MUL-T}}. Damage taken without the Silence Between Two Strikes can be recovered when switching to this equipment and back again. (Last tested V1.2.4.1)
** This is also the case with {{ItemLink|itemName=Shared Design}}.
** When an enemy is killed, it’s whole body is covered in blue energy and disintegrates into blue splinters of light instead of falling over or exploding like they normally would.  If the bombs placed on an enemy have not detonated, they stay in the air until they explode.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}} and {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}. 

When striking an enemy with an attack that deals 400% or more base damage, the Band creates a 15m black hole, which pulls enemies in its radius into its center. After 5 seconds, the black hole explodes, dealing 100% (''+100% per stack'') [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] to all enemies inside its radius. This bonus attack has a cooldown of 20 seconds and a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

==Notes== 
*The cooldown for the Singularity Band can be seen above the player's health bar as a {{StatusEffectLink|ElementalRingVoidCooldown|altText=status effect}} with up to 20 stacks. 1 stack is removed every second, and when the last stack is removed the Band is {{StatusEffectLink|ElementalRingVoidReady|altText=ready}} and can be activated again.
** Because this status effect is considered a debuff, activating the {{ItemLink|itemName=Blast Shower}} will reset the cooldown immediately. However, {{ItemLink|Ben's Raincoat}} does ''not'' prevent it from being inflicted.

== Tips==
*The Singularity Band deals only 100% damage, and has double the cooldown of the uncorrupted bands. This makes it much more niche, as the uncorrupted bands will deal much more damage on average.
*While it has double the cooldown of its uncorrupted counterparts and a 5-second delay when dealing damage, this item has neither the single-target limitation of Runald's Band nor the need for targets to stay close to the activation point of Kjaro's Band.
**However, since it cannot pull {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm|Magma}} and {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm|Overloading Worms}}, they are very likely to avoid the explosion.
*Since the Singularity Band deals considerably less raw damage than its uncorrupted counterparts, it can be useful for [[Survivors]] who lack extremely powerful single-hit skills but who can still activate the Bands with their skills. In this case, the Singularity Band's utility for grouping up enemies may be more useful than the pure damage of Kjaro's and Runald's Bands.
*Unlike its uncorrupted counterparts, this item has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0, so it can activate certain items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Sticky Bomb}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Ukulele}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Brilliant Behemoth}}. Because both Sticky Bomb and Brilliant Behemoth deal area-of-effect damage, they pair extremely well with the black hole effect of the Singularity Band. A single stack of Brilliant Behemoth, for example, will increase the single enemy damage to a total of 160% of the value of the attack that brought the Singularity into existence. More enemies will further increase this value by 60% per enemy (or squared when it comes to total damage). 
**In this situation, it takes just 5 enemies for the total damage of Singularity Bands to surpass that of an equal number of stacks of Kjaro's Band, and just 2 enemies to deal almost as much single-target damage as an equal number of stacks of Runald's Band. However, having double the cooldown means that it would require 10 enemies with Kjaro's band/4 enemies with Runald's band to make the Singularity Band have superior DPS.

{{VersionHistory|
;[[PC Patch v1.2.4.0]]

}}

==Trivia==
* Prior to Patch 1.2.4, the Singularity Band did not have a proper proc chain mask. Because the black hole has a proc coefficient, by clearing the cooldown debuff with the Blast Shower before it collapses, the Singularity Band could activate itself again. With more than 1 stack, each subsequent black hole would deal multiple times as much damage as the previous one.

[[File:Siphoned Forest logbook.png|thumb|220x220px|Siphoned Forest logbook diorama|link=Special:FilePath/Siphoned_Forest_logbook.png]]
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is one of the five new environments added to the game with the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'', located on [[Petrichor V]], and is found in the first set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

The map is blanketed in a layer of snow, with large trees surrounded by platforms spanning multiple levels. Several frozen rivers cross through the center of the map, where characters will glide across the surface. A fire pit can be found, which does not deal damage to players if stood upon. The outer edge of the map has a raised cliff face, with a shallow inner cave system, which is either blocked off or open to the player; if open, the cave can spawn interactables such as the teleporter. 

==Interactables ==

==Monsters ==

== Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and exactly 1 will spawn:

== Notes ==
*Sap from the trees appears to be flowing upward.
*"Siphoned" appears to relate to the taps on the trees.
*Siphoned Forest shares many similar design aspects with [[Scorched Acres]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an environment introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]'', located on [[Petrichor V]]. The stage is a part of the fourth set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

This is the only area where the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, a stronger variant of the {{MonsterLink|Solus Control Unit}}, can be found.

==Monsters==

==Alloy Vulture Nests==
[[File:Alloy Vulture Nest.png|thumb|192px|An Alloy Vulture Nest with eggs intact]]
Several Alloy Vulture Nests will spawn at random locations around Siren's Call. Destroying the eggs of a nest activates any on-kill effects the player has and drops a healing orb that heals 40% of the player's max health when collected.

Destroying 6 nests will spawn the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, a boss unique to Siren's Call. Upon defeat, it will drop a [[Items#Legendary|legendary item]] for each player in the game (dead or alive) around the central pillar. The item dropped is the same for all players.

The warning message {{Color|#FF69B4|"You hear a distant whirring"}} will appear in the chat upon destroying the 5th nest. Destroying a 6th nest will trigger the message {{Color|#FF69B4|"The whirring grows loud"}} and the spawn of the boss.

Players might want to be careful with their attacks, as a lot of items granting large areas of effect can easily destroy nests against their will. Some such items are {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}, {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}, {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}, {{ItemLink|Unstable Tesla Coil}}, and {{ItemLink|Glowing Meteorite}}.

== Notes== 
*[[Shrine of Chance|Shrines of Chance]] cannot spawn on Siren's Call.

==Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and exactly 1 will spawn:
#Behind the arc near the obelisk where the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}} spawns.
#Spike/Stalagmite in cave (there are a few including one vertical one the player can jump on to access it)
#Atop the hanging crate.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is the 5th stage [[Environments|Environment]] added in the ''[[Early Access Artifacts Content Update|Artifacts Content Update]]'' and the first returning stage from Risk of Rain 1. It is located within the upper atmosphere of [[Petrichor V]].

The {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}} can be accessed from this stage which is where the 16 [[Artifacts]] are unlocked.

The teleporter in this Environment is a unique version called the [[Teleporter#Primordial Teleporter|Primordial Teleporter]] which has outer rings that can be interacted with prior to starting the Teleporter Event to either align with the moon to access {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} or to align with the planet to [[Environments#Looping|Loop]].

{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters==

==Compound Generator==
An island below the main area shelters the Compound Generator, a large machine used to spawn the Artifact Portal leading to {{EnvironmentLink|Bulwark's Ambry}}. It is accessible by going through one of the 2 floor doors or by dropping down from the correct edge of the main landmass. 

Monsters will not spawn on the island housing the Compound Generator, but they can follow you down from above.

The Compound Generator can be interacted with in two ways:

*9 switches can be cycled through displaying one of four shapes: square, circle, triangle, diamond (■ ● ▲ ♦). In a specific sequence, these 9 shapes can generate the artifact portal.
*The computer can be used to submit the current code to the Generator that will then try to open the Artifact Portal.

If the wrong code is submitted, the Portal's opening will fail and players can put in another code.

Using the Artifact Portal will lead to Bulwark's Ambry where the players will face a trial to unlock the Artifact corresponding to the code entered in the Compound Generator. It is possible to completely skip the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] of Sky Meadow by going through this teleporter, but players can still use the Artifact Portal after completing the Teleporter Event.

''For a spoiler free way to find the Artifact Codes, see [[Artifact Hints]]. Otherwise, see [[Artifacts]] for more information.''

==Newt Altars==
There are 5 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and exactly 1 will spawn:

# On the big sloping piece of land at the center of the map, under the big round rock.
#Near the other floor door leading to the [[Sky Meadow#Compound Generator|Compound Generator]].

==Trivia==
*The music playing on Sky Meadows is titled "''The Rain Formerly Known as Purple''" this is a reference to both the song [[wikipedia:Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]] by [[wikipedia:Prince (musician)|Prince]] as well as Prince changing his stage name to "''The Artist (Formerly Known as Prince)''" in 1993 due to a legal dispute with Warner Bros. Records.
** Additionally the guitar riff that starts being repeated at around [https://youtu.be/EGXPAoyP_cg?t=286 4:46] is a cover of the same guitar riff being played in Purple Rain [https://youtu.be/edDiY323768?t=279 around the same time].
**Similarly the piano that can be heard around [https://youtu.be/EGXPAoyP_cg?t=395 6:35] is replicating the piano heard [https://youtu.be/edDiY323768?t=403 near the end of the song].
**Additionally [[wikipedia:Prince (musician)#/media/File:Prince_logo.svg|the symbol]] that prince used can be seen faintly [https://youtu.be/EGXPAoyP_cg?t=467 at the end] of the youtube video of the song uploaded by the song's artist Chris Christodoulou.

*The {{MonsterLink|Grandparent}} is twice as likely to be chosen as the [[Teleporter|Teleporter Boss]] than the other bosses. The same also applies to its [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] counterpart.

The '''Soldier's Syringe''' is a [[ror:Soldier's Syringe|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item increases attack speed by 15% ''(+15% per stack)'', decreasing the intervals between individual attacks and increasing the animation speed of all skills. This also means that any attack that needs to charge, such as Artificer's {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Nano-Bomb|survivorName=}} will charge faster as well.

== Notes ==

* The Soldier's Syringe only increases the animation speed of skills; it does not affect their cooldowns. Most primary skills have no cooldown, the exceptions being {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}, {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}}, and{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Heretic}}. This does not mean that Syringes are useless on these [[Survivors]], though. Their primary skills will still be used faster (aside from Bandit), and there are other tangible benefits. 
**Higher attack speed will shorten the charge time for Artificer's {{SkillLink|Charged Nano-Bomb|Artificer|Charged Nano-Bombs}}  and {{SkillLink|Cast Nano-Spear|Artificer|Cast Nano-Spears}}  and increase the number of times {{SkillLink|skillName=Flamethrower}} hits. Even a slight increase in attack speed can drastically enhance Flamethrower and allow faster bombs and spears.
**{{SurvivorLink|Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|Vulcan Shotgun|Captain}}, narrows its spread more rapidly with greater attack speed, in addition to having reduced ending lag between shots.
***Notably, attack speed does ''not'' affect how long it takes for {{SkillLink|skillName=Orbital Probe}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike}}, or {{SkillLink|skillName=Orbital Supply Beacon}} to land.
**Bandit's primaries {{SkillLink|Burst|Bandit}} and {{SkillLink|Blast|Bandit}} can be used as fast as the player can press the button, which is not affected by attack speed boosts. However, more attack speed will allow them to reload faster.
***Higher attack speed also speeds up the animations for {{SkillLink|Lights Out|Bandit}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado|survivorName=}}, reducing the delay between activating the skill and dealing damage.
** MUL-T's {{SkillLink|skillName=Scrap Launcher|survivorName=}}  can be fired faster with greater attack speed, and the Syringe applies to both of MUL-T's selected primary attacks.
** Both {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner|altText=Railgunner's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Supercharge}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Cryocharge}} will prepare to fire and fire faster with increased attack speed, and Supercharge's reboot time is shortened by attack speed improvements.
** Railgunner's {{SkillLink|skillName=Active Reload}} presents a larger perfect reload window with increased attack speed.
**Heretic's {{SkillLink|skillName=Slicing Maelstrom|survivorName=}} secondary will charge faster with Syringes, allowing her to dispose of groups of monsters more quickly.
***This also applies for any Survivor equipped with the {{ItemLink|Hooks of Heresy}}.
** As a consequence of the game engine, the max attack speed is capped at 60 attacks per second, but it may vary depending on the survivor.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''. Being a Boss, the Solus Control Unit may be encountered after initiating a stage's Teleporter Event. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Charged Shot ===
The Solus Control Unit charges for 1.5 seconds (scales with [[Damage|attack speed]]) and fires 6 light blue orbs at the player in either a horizontal or vertical 24° arc. The orb are fired in timespan of 1.5 seconds (scales with attack speed) and since the Solus Control Unit can rotate to face the target during the attack, the orbs can fan out more. Each orb moves at 60m/s and explodes upon impact in a radius of 6m with no [[Damage#Falloff Damage|falloff]]. They can also be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

Each shot deals 100% damage and has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. The skills has a cooldown of 6 seconds.

=== Utility: Probe Launch ===
The Solus Control Unit summons up 3 {{MonsterLink|Solus Probe|Solus Probes}} nearby every 0.66 seconds. If there are already 3 Solus Probes on the field, the move will be wasted.The skill animation lasts for a total of 6 seconds including the ally spawning. Aditionally, the spawned monsters will inherit the [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] type if the boss has one, similar to {{MonsterLink|Beetle Queen}} and her guards.

The skill has a cooldown of 45 seconds.

=== Special: Charged Detonation ===
The Solus Control Unit acquires any targets up to 200m away and selects the one closest to its aiming direction. It then summons a large blue circle on the ground at a random point within a 5m radius from its target. The circle has a radius of 30m but when it explodes after 3 seconds, it deals damage only in a radius of 20m with no falloff. Captain's Defensive Microbots can delete this circle before it explodes.

The circle constantly applies a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50|altText=slow debuff}} for 0.5 seconds for any targets within. The explosion deals 400% damage, has a proc coefficient of 1.0, and applies the same debuff for 2 seconds. It also launches any targets high up in the air with a force of 9000.

The skill has a cooldown of 15 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special''': the Solus Control Unit must have less than 25% health.
# '''Use utility''': the Solus Control Unit must have less than 90% health.
# '''Use primary and flee''': the Solus Control Unit must be within 15m from its target. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds every time it is selected. If the player jumps on its head, the Solus Control Unit will lower itself on the ground in an effort to "move away" from the player. It will also spin wildly depending on what angle player is compared to its aiming direction.
# '''Use primary and stop''': the Solus Control Unit must be within 15-50m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: [[Empathy Cores]]''

If the Solus Control Unit is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Solus Control Unit) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}.

== Notes ==
* Due to their mechanical status, Solus Control Units cannot become {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}}.

== Tips ==
* Fighting the Solus Control Unit in melee range can be dangerous. It can turn around very quickly, and players will suffer severe damage if hit by multiple Charge Shots at once.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an airborne mechanical-eye [[Monsters|monster]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''. It is a smaller version of the {{MonsterLink|Solus Control Unit}} and {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}.

These bosses spawn Solus Probes in groups of three at a time. These monsters otherwise do not spawn naturally, except in the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}} Hidden Realm, {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} in the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] game mode, or while the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} is active.

== Environments ==
*{{EntityLink|Void Fields}}
* Only spawned by Bosses:
** {{EntityLink|Siren's Call}}
** {{EntityLink|Sky Meadow}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Primary: Beam Attack ===
The Solus Probe attacks by firing a blue beam at the player, similar to the {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|Stone Titan's}} laser attack but slower. This beam rapidly deals 20% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.2 per tick. The beam ticks every 0.2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and has a range of 60m. 

There is a 2 second cooldown between turning the beam off and back on.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary and flee''': the Solus Probe must be within 20m from its target. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Solus Probe must be within 20-40m from its target. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds.
# '''Chase''': no requirements, as long as the acquired target is alive. This behavior will be active for 2 seconds.
# '''Return to leader''': the Solus Probe must have an owner and be more than 10m away. It will try to acquire a new target on the next frame, so it will stay near the leader until it successfully does so. If the leader dies before the Solus Probe has found a new target, this behavior will not be selectable and as such it will switch to the [[Enemy AI#Wander|Wander]] AI state.

== Notes ==
* Due to their mechanical status, Solus Probes cannot become {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}}.

== Tips ==
* The Solus Probe is not particularly dangerous, as its beam deals relatively low damage compared to other monsters. However, the beam can very easily chip the player, which can prove dangerous if reliant on [[Health#Shield|shields]] or regenerative items such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Cautious Slug}}.
* Generally the Solus Probes will not be a large threat to the player, but they can become overwhelming in the beginning of a run due to their relatively high max health.
** Normally this is not an issue due to them only appearing from {{MonsterLink|Solus Control Unit|Solus Control Units}} in normal stages.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

When a large monster is killed it will always drop an item. All [[Monsters#Elites|elites]] have a 5% ''(+1% per item stack)'' chance of dropping an item. 

==Notes==
*{{Color|note|Correction:}} The Logbook Entry for Sonorous Whispers is incorrect. The formula is actually &lt;math&gt;4 + (1 \times stacks)&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the item actually is 5% (+1% per stack).
*Sonorous Whispers is affected by [[Luck]].
*The rarity chances for the item drop are 89.91%/{{Color|Uncommon|9.99%}}/{{Color|Legendary|0.1%}}. This is affected by the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]].
* "Large Monsters" are classified as [[Monsters#Bosses|boss-type]] enemies, whether they be world-spawn or event bosses.  
**In addition, both {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}} and [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special bosses]], with the exception of {{MonsterLink|Artifact Reliquary}}, can drop items.
***{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} only drops an item in his final phase.
*It is possible to obtain two items if the boss is also an elite and the roll succeeds.
**This can stack on top of the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} and {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}}, effectively netting up to 4 items per kill.
*The player can get twice as many drops with the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} since each spawned monster is doubled.

==Lore==
{{Lore}}

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
*Item Changes
**Loot chance from {{ItemLink|Sonorous Whispers}} has been rebalanced to favour white items.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.2]]
*Elite item drop chance: 15% (+5% per stack) -&gt; 4% (+1% per stack).
----
;[[Seekers of the Storm]]
*Added New Item: Sonorous Whispers
}}

==Trivia==
*The chance of getting a {{Color|Legendary|legendary}} drop from an elite with 1 stack of Sonorous Whispers is approximately 1 in 27283 elite kills, making it an even rarer drop that its [[Items#Elite Equipment|aspect]].
*While the item's functionality has not changed since the release of Seekers of the Storm, initially the internal name for the item was ResetChests, which may hint to a reworked functionality before the expansion's release. Its internal name was finally updated in [[Patch v1.3.7]] to better represent its actual functionality.
** In the code for the{{ArtifactLink|Delusion}} the method that resets chests after the Teleporter Event is also called ResetChests. It is possible this item's original concept had some links to what eventually became the aforementioned artifact.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder kills an enemy, the cooldown for their held [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] instantly decreases by 4 seconds (''+2 seconds per stack'').

== Effective limit ==
The following amount of stacks of Soulbound Catalyst is needed to instantly recharge equipment on kill.

== Notes ==
* The {{ItemLink|Fuel Array}}, {{ItemLink|The Crowdfunder}}, {{ItemLink|Executive Card}}, and the Elite Equipment do not have cooldowns, and thus do not benefit from {{PAGENAME}}.
* Destroying clay pots or barrels will count towards the cooldown reduction.
* Kills scored by {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Turrets}} will not reduce Engineer's equipment cooldown.
* Using this item with the {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} reduces its cooldown by a total of 32 seconds over a period of 8 seconds. This allows the player to activate the Forgive Me Please equipment every 5 seconds.

== Trivia ==
* The shape of the skull is a reference to Reaper from another Hopoo game, [https://hopoogames.com/deadbolt/ DEADBOLT].
* The phrase from the logbook entry, "another night", may also be referencing DEADBOLT, as the same phrase serves as an introduction to the protagonist.
* The phrase "if you thought the ring was a rare find" is in reference to the [[Ror:Wicked Ring|Wicked Ring]] from Risk of Rain 1. The Wicked Ring functions similarly to the Soulbound Catalyst, but it reduces ''all'' cooldowns upon landing a critical hit.

==Namesakes==
Just like in Risk of Rain 1, composer Chris Christodoulou has given every song in the soundtrack a name related to rain.

Whether it’s in plain sight or a bit more elaborate.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Risk of Rain 2 song!!Meaning
!Explanation/Quote
|-
|'''Through a Cloud, Darkly'''||Dark clouds are associated with rain.
|Could be a reference to the UES Safe Travels approaching Petrichor V, as seen in the start-up cinematic.
|-
|'''Risk of Rain 2'''||The name of the second game.
|A risk of failure or bad things happening.
|-
|'''Evapotranspiration'''||The process of water moving from the earth’s surface into the atmosphere.
|Evapotranspiration is generally what causes rain to happen, since it’s a part of the water cycle.
|-
|'''Thermodynamic Equilibrium'''
| An axiomatic concept of thermodynamics.
|It is observed that some property of an object, like the pressure in a volume of gas, the length of a metal rod, or the electrical conductivity of a wire, can change when the object is heated or cooled. If two of these objects are brought into physical contact there is initially a change in the property of both objects. But, eventually, the change in property stops and the objects are said to be in thermal, or thermodynamic, equilibrium. 
|-
|'''Terra Pluviam'''||Latin for “Earth” and “Rain”, respectively.
| Could be translated to “Land of Rain”.
|-
|'''Köppen as Fuck'''||May be a reference to the "Tropical Rainforest Climate", which is designated as "Af" in the Köppen climate classification (Köppen Af).
|In this context, Af is used as AF, written abbreviation for “as fuck”. 
|-
|'''Disdrometer'''|| An instrument used to measure the drop size distribution and velocity of falling hydrometeors.
|Hydrometeors like graupel, hail and, of course, rain.
|-
|'''Into the Doldrums'''||“Doldrums” refers to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a stripe or band area near the thermal equator where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge.
The doldrums, specifically, is an area of the ITCZ known by sailors for its calm, windless nature.
|The ITCZ in general has a drastic effect on the weather, affecting rainfalls in multiple equatorial nations. There’s even an area inside the ITCZ known as the Monsoon Trough, which plays a role in creating many of the world's rainforests.
|-
|'''A Glacier Eventually Farts (And Don't You Listen to the Song of Life)'''||A direct quote from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkJiasC3cRI Werner Herzog's Minnesota Declaration]. This is the second time Werner Herzog is referenced in this song, since Chris Christodolou sampled a narration by Herzog from the documentary Burden of Dreams for this track.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Mother Nature doesn’t call, doesn’t speak to you, although a glacier eventually farts. And don’t you listen to the Song of Life”'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''Nocturnal Emission'''||Also known as a wet dream.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Another one of those great titles of mine. Google it.”'' - Chris Christodoulou (Risk of Rain 2 Album Commentary)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''The Dehydration of Risk of Rain 2'''||The intended name of this track was “The Dehydration of Risk of Rain 2's Main Theme by the Composer Chris Christodoulou”.
|This is a reference to the long titles of old novels of the likes of “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford”.
|-
|'''Hydrophobia'''|| Contrary to what one might believe, Hydrophobia is not the fear of water. This was an old name for Rabies, a viral disease that causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in humans and other mammals.
|Hydrophobia its the technically correct term for fear of water (now known as Aquaphobia). But Hydrophobia now refers to a symptom of later-stage rabies, which manifests itself in humans as difficulty in swallowing, fear when presented with liquids to drink, and an inability to quench one's thirst. 
|-
|'''Antarctic Oscillation'''||Refers to a variation of the atmosphere in the form of a belt of strong westerly winds or low-pressure surrounding Antarctica. 
| It’s known for having two phases that bring positive and negative effects on the weather, all related to humidity, snowfalls and rainfalls.
|-
|'''The Rain Formerly Known as Purple'''||The name is a play on the song Purple Rain by Prince, and one of Prince's appellations ("The Artist Formerly Known as Prince"). In fact, the whole track IS the play, featuring similar motifs from the original song.
On a deeper level, the meaning of the purple rain refers to the end of the world.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''"When there's blood in the sky... red and blue = purple. Purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/God guide you through the purple rain."'' - Prince&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''The Raindrop that Fell to the Sky'''||Not confirmed.
| On another level, and as Chris says in the album commentary, at the mid-point of the production of the soundtrack he felt tired and even started to think he might not complete the project. But also the need to create something special was there, so this song was kind of an outlet to that frustration. 
|-
|'''You're Gonna Need a Bigger Ukulele'''||A reference to a quote from the movie Jaws. And likely a reference to how iconic the Ukulele is within the Risk of Rain media.
And also, maybe a reference to how no one has what it takes when facing the final boss of the game, [[Mithrix]].
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“You’re going to need a bigger boat.”'' - Martin Brody&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''...con lentitud poderosa'''
|The three last words of a paragraph from '''El Inmortal''', a short story about a human who accidentally achieves immortality, and the metaphysical paradoxes he has to face. Written by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.
|
{| class="fandom-table"
!'''Original (Spanish)'''
|"Pensé en un mundo sin memoria, sin tiempo, consideré la posibilidad de un lenguaje que ignorara los sustantivos, un lenguaje de verbos impersonales o de indeclinables epítetos.
Así fueron muriendo los días y con los días los años, pero algo parecido a la felicidad ocurrió una mañana. Llovió, '''con lentitud poderosa.'''"
|-
!'''English Translation'''
| "I thought of a world without memory, without time, I considered the possibility of a language that ignored nouns, a language of impersonal verbs or indeclinable epithets.
Thus the days died and with the days the years, but something similar to happiness happened one morning. It rained, '''with powerful slowness.'''"
|}
|-
|'''Petrichor V'''
|The smell of the earth after the rain.
|Despite the simple meaning, there’s a longer story behind the name.
Upon releasing the Risk of Rain 1 soundtrack, a YouTube comment gave Chris Christodoulou the idea of using the word “petrichor” for a song title. Chris remembered this comment even when he lost the bookmark for it.

When the time came to make the Risk of Rain 2 soundtrack, Chris was going to use the title “Petrichor” for this song, but a song with the same title was featured in the Hyper Light Drifter soundtrack by Disasterpeace. So, he had to come up with something else, which was the “V” in the title.

The V has multiple meanings that Chris has mentioned in the album commentary: 

*The Roman number five.
*The number five itself being a big thing within the whole soundtrack, since Chris uses that kind of tempo several times.
*A reference to Vangelis, the composer of the Blade Runner soundtrack. Blade Runner being one of Chris’ and Hopoo Games’ main inspirations for the game.

Petrichor V inside the Risk of Rain lore is also the planet on which both games take place.
|-
|'''Lacrimosum'''
|Latin for “tearful”. 
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''"I remember the old days and I cry; and I go in the ill wind that carries me. Here, there, like the dead leaf."'' - Chanson d'Automne by French poet Paul Verlaine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|}

===&lt;u&gt;Survivors of the Void&lt;/u&gt;===
The deeper meaning behind the names is also featured in the Survivors of the Void soundtrack. With the added bonus of not only featuring names related to rain, but also names related to eldritch horrors and abominations. Which is itself a reference to the Void thematic of the SOTV expansion.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!SOTV song!!Meaning
!Explanation/Quote
|-
|'''Prelude in D Flat Major'''||The name of the song by Chopin that Chris Christodoulou re-arranged in the Risk of Rain style.
|This Chopin song is also known as the “Raindrop” prelude, which is probably the main reason why Chris used it.
|-
|'''A Placid Island of Ignorance'''||A quote from '''The Call of Cthulhu''', a short story by American writer H. P. Lovecraft.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on '''a placid island of ignorance''' in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''Having Fallen, It Was Blood'''|| A quote from '''Silence: A Fable''', a book by American writer Edgar Allan Poe.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, '''having fallen, it was blood.'''”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''Out of Whose Womb Came the Ice?'''
|A quote from the Bible. Specifically, from Job 38:29.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew? '''Out of whose womb came the ice?''' And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''Once in a Lullaby'''||Part of the lyrics from '''Over the Rainbow''' by Yip Harburg.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high''
''There’s a land that I heard of '''once in a lullaby'''''

''Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue''

''And the dreams that you dare to dream''

''Really do come true''&lt;/blockquote&gt;On a deeper level, the song Over the Rainbow talks about a “rainbow world”. An idealization of the world the current generation wants to live in and give to the next generation.
But at the same time, talks how the current generation has failed at making this rainbow world, and how they might never see it. Which kind of defines the Risk of Rain story as a whole.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“But we could hand down our songs, which still hand down to hope and laughter. So, in times of confusion like these, when the whole world is a hopeless jumble and the raindrops tumble all around, Heaven opens a plane. When purple clouds darken up the skyway, there’s a lovely highway to be found, leading from your windowpane to a spot behind the sun. Just a step beyond the rain.”'' - Yip Harburg&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''A Boat Made from a Sheet of Newspaper'''
| A quote from '''IT''', a horror novel by American writer Stephen King.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The terror, which would not end for another 28 years -if it ever did end- began, so far as I know or can tell, with '''a boat made from a sheet of newspaper''' floating down a gutter swollen with rain”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''They Might As Well Be Dead'''
|Part of the lyrics of the song '''Rain''', by The Beatles.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;If the rain comes
They run and hide their head

'''They might as well be dead'''

If the rain comes&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''The Face of The Deep'''
|A quote from the Bible. Specifically, from Job 38:30.
This is the second time Chris Christodoulou has quoted this specific Job chapter.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The waters are hid as with a stone, and '''the face of the deep''' is frozen”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;


This title could also be a wordplay. Not only you’re on the Deep Void, the face of the deep, when this song plays. You’re also facing the literal Face of the Deep, [[Voidling|the Voidling]].
|-
|'''Who Can Fathom the Soundless Depths?'''
|A quote from '''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''', a book by French writer Jules Verne. Specifically, from the ending of the book.
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“Accordingly there are two men out of all mankind who are now qualified to answer that question asked 6,000 years ago in the Book of Ecclesiastes: '''‘Who can fathom the soundless depths?’''' Those two men are Captain Nemo and myself.”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|}

! SOTS song!!Meaning
!Explanation/Quote
|-
|'''A Tempestuous Noise of Thunder and Lightning Heard'''||This title is a stage direction quoted from William Shakespeare's '''The Tempest'''.
|Scene 1
'''''A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.'''''

''Enter a Shipmaster and a Boatswain.''
|-
| '''Oṃ Maṇi Padme Hūṃm, part I-III'''||"Oṃ Maṇi Padme Hūṃm" is a Sanskrit mantra.
|The literal meaning in English has been expressed as "praise to the jewel in the lotus", or as a declarative aspiration, possibly meaning "I in the jewel-lotus". &lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om_mani_padme_hum&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| '''屋根の漏り (Yane No Mori)'''
|The final line from a haiku. Translates to "'''a roof that leaks'''".
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“春雨や 蜂の巣つたふ '''屋根の漏り'''”''

"Spring rain –
running down a wasp’s nest

from '''a roof that leaks'''"&lt;ref&gt;https://matsuobashohaiku.home.blog/2021/03/14/does-your-roof-leak/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

|
|-
|'''I Should Build the Man a Statue'''||Not confirmed.

'''''Forgot the cry of gulls''', and the deep sea swell''

''And the profit and loss.”''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|-
|'''(The Song of Life)'''||Not confirmed, but most likely the latter half of the aforementioned [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkJiasC3cRI Werner Herzog's Minnesota Declaration] quote. Likely bracketed to match the previous song name's formatting.
|''“Mother Nature doesn’t call, doesn’t speak to you, although a glacier eventually farts. And don’t you listen to '''the Song of Life'''”''
|-
|'''It Can't Rain All The Time'''
|A quote from the 1994 movie '''The Crow''', as uttered by the titular character, played by Brandon Lee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTw3GCCeH4Q&lt;/ref&gt;
|&lt;blockquote&gt;''“I wish the rain would stop just once.” ~Sara''

"'''It can't rain all the time."''' ~Eric Draven/The Crow

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motifs ==
Along with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xDVomMgvqw the basic Risk of Rain motif] that is found throughout both soundtracks, a number of songs also borrow motifs from the first Risk of Rain soundtrack, or even other songs in and outside of Risk of Rain 2:

==Trivia ==
*'''Through a Cloud, Darkly''', '''You're Gonna Need a Bigger Ukulele''', '''...con lentitud poderosa''' and '''Lacrimosum''' were added with the [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/2744334079861093223 1.0 update].
* The main melody of '''Risk of Rain 2''' and '''The Dehydration of Risk of Rain 2''' is adapted from the melody of "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9G1Eok4zRk The Ghost Writer]" from Alexandre Desplat's score for [[wikipedia:The Ghost Writer (film)|the film of the same name]].
*'''Nocturnal Emission''' was previously used on [[Sundered Grove]] before the release of [[Survivors of the Void]].
*The ending of '''Terra Pluviam''' is an adaptation of the opening chords of "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GVGWWR4HYU Mission to the Asteroid]" from Michael Land's score 1995 game [[wikipedia:The Dig (video game)|The Dig]], made to fit the RoR2 sound pallette.
*'''Köppen As Fuck''' was added with the [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/1595878665982945764 Scorched Acres update].
*'''A Glacier Eventually Farts (And Don't You Listen to the Song of Life)''' was added with the [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/3724971346869698315 Hidden Realms update]. The voice featured on the track (but not present in-game) is the one of Werner Herzog from the "making-of" documentary film [[wikipedia:Burden of Dreams|Burden of Dreams]] (1982). The sampled dialogue is not featured in-game, and the instrumental version is a bonus track on the soundtrack.
*'''A Glacier Eventually Farts''' samples the outro of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysPtBjY8o_A Coalescence] from RoR at around 2 minutes in.
* '''The Dehydration of Risk of Rain 2''' was originally titled '''The Dehydration of Risk of Rain 2's Main Theme by the Composer Chris Christodoulou''' up until the 1.0 update. Christodoulou explained that the song's title was shortened as some distribution platforms may return errors if a song title includes the artist's name in it.
* '''Antarctic Oscillation''' and '''The Rain Formerly Known as Purple''' were added with the [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/2098055393562282872 Artifacts update]. The latter was initially called '''The Rain Previously Known as Purple'''.
*'''The Rain Formerly Known as Purple''' incorporates an arpeggiating piano motif and an ascending guitar motif from "[https://youtu.be/S6Y1gohk5-A?t=281 Purple Rain]", a song by the late artist [[wikipedia:Prince (musician)|Prince]]. The outro to both songs are also similar, including the use of piano and cymbals. The song also uses manipulated samples of the electric piano and clarinet from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSnOWqTPUNQ Chanson d'Automne] from RoR.
*'''The Raindrop that Fell to the Sky''' was added with the [https://steamcommunity.com/games/632360/announcements/detail/3629261603725096696 Skills 2.0 update].
*The YouTube release of '''Prelude in D flat major''', as well as the release of the full Soundtrack of SOTV in Bandcamp and Spotify and also the release of the DLC itself, happened the same day: March 1st, Frédéric Chopin's birthday.
*In a first for the franchise, '''Prelude in D flat major''' and '''Who Can Fathom the Soundless Depths?''' are the first songs that are not composed by Christodoulou, but are rather his arrangements of Frédéric Chopin's Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 (appropriately named the "Raindrop" prelude).
*'''Out of Whose Womb Came the Ice?''' contains a breif section of the RoR song "Arctic Oscilation"
*The transition between '''Om Mani Padme Hum, Part I ''' and '''屋根の漏り (Yane No Mori)''' is likely an homage to Pink Floyd, as many of their albums contain similar seamless transitions between songs when listened to in order.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

The holder gains an ally, Colonel Droneman, who respawns every stage if destroyed. All the holder's allied [[Interactables#Drones|drones]] get +50% attack speed (''+50% per stack''), have their cooldowns reduced by 50% (''-50% per stack''), have a 10% chance to fire a missile on hit that deals 300% [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] (similar to the {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}), and get a chain gun that fires 6 shots for 100% damage each which can ricochet to 2 other enemies.

== Notes ==
* This item benefits all ''mechanical'' allies of the holder. This means that, in addition to the usual drones, these allies are also empowered:
** The {{EntityLink|entityName=Strike Drone|altText=Strike Drones|altUrl=The_Back-up}} summoned by {{ItemLink|The Back-up}}.
**{{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets.
***Since the turrets have items in their inventory, both the chain gun and the missile can proc them.
**The probes summoned by the {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}. Although no visible gun is added to the probes, they will still utilize its attack.
**Gummy clones of {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}} spawned with {{ItemLink|itemName=Goobo Jr.}}, since MUL-T and REX are considered mechanical. Gummy Engineer turrets also benefit.
* Although they may seem like they should benefit, the {{EntityLink|entityName=Squid Polyp Turret|altText=Squid Turret|altUrl=Squid_Polyp}} summoned by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Squid Polyp}} and the allied {{EntityLink|entityName=Alpha Construct (Ally)|altText=Alpha Constructs|altUrl=Alpha Construct}} from the {{ItemLink|itemName=Defense Nucleus}} are ''not'' affected by the Spare Drone Parts.
* Since the {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}} is affected by the Spare Drone Parts, it can attack enemies without using its equipment. This also means equipment that were previously useless for Equipment Drones, like the {{ItemLink|Ocular HUD}}, may have newfound purpose.
** If the Equipment Drone has a Goobo Jr., the Gummy Equipment Drones spawned will also be affected by the Spare Drone Parts. The same goes for Strike Drones summoned if the Equipment Drone has The Back-up.
* If the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, one Spare Drone Parts will result in two Col. Droneman spawning with half health.
* The chain gun gained from the Spare Drone Parts is attached to the existing spinning guns on {{EntityLink|entityName=Gunner Drone|altText=Gunner Drones}} and {{EntityLink|entityName=TC-280 Prototype|altText=TC-280 Prototypes}}, meaning the extra gun will flail wildly when the main one is firing.
*When this item is lost, e.g., with a [[Scrapper]], [[Shrine of Order]], or [[3D Printers|3D Printer]], Col. Droneman will not be removed as an ally. Whenever getting this item, the player will always gain a copy of Col. Droneman, even if they already have one. This can be observed when the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}} steals the item in his final phase and it is later returned to the player.

==Tips==
*Be advised that when Mithrix steals this item during his fourth phase, he ''' will not''' gain a Col. Droneman himself but will leave the player's droneman defenceless by removing all bonuses to any drones the player has. (Col. Droneman does not actually have any attacks and its only source of damage is the generic chaingun that every drone gets when holding this item)
**When the item is returned, the player will obtain a second Col. Droneman and both drones will obtain the chaingun as well (assuming the first one survives until then).
**There is currently a bug on all console editions of ror2 where Mithrix will steal this item and will gain a Col. Droneman, so pick up spare drone parts at your discretion.
*This item augments damage drones, while providing healing and utility drones an attack to contribute in offensive ways.
*This item synergizes well with a {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} drone build. While {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|Captain|his passive|altImg=Defensive Microbots (Skill)}} provides defensive measures against most monsters, the Spare Drone Parts allows drone minions to deal considerably more damage. In addition, Spare Drone Parts' attack speed boost means Defensive Microbots can delete projectiles more frequently.
* Although it is tempting to gather as many drones as possible, keep in mind the ally limit of 15; past this point, allies cannot be spawned by items or equipment (e.g. the Empathy Cores or The Back-up). If too many small drones or non-drone allies are on the team, these more powerful drone allies cannot be summoned once destroyed, lowering the team's damage output. This may not be much of an issue, however, since the weaponry provided by the Spare Drone Parts is so powerful to begin with.

==Trivia==
*The Spare Drone Parts are the successor to an item in the first Risk of Rain, the [[Ror:Arms Race|Arms Race]], which worked in a similar manner.
*Prior to 1.2.2.0, it was possible for an Engineers' Turret to obtain their own Colonel Droneman. This is no longer the case.
*There is a 10% chance for the chaingun and missile to be replaced with a handgun attached to an arm. This difference however, is purely cosmetic.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Elite Equipment|Elite equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. It can only be found as a rare drop from a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixHaunted}} [[Monsters#Celestine|Elite]]. The drop chance is 1/4000 from each Celestine Elite, but this chance is affected by the {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} and {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

A player equipped with the Spectral Circlet gains the power of a Celestine Elite; their attacks{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow80|altText=greatly slow}} enemies, and they gain a 30 meter radius aura that grants the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixHauntedRecipient}} buff to non-Celestine allies within, turning them invisible. 

Although the Spectral Circlet is held in the equipment slot, it works passively and cannot be activated. Equipment cooldown reduction and additional equipment charges from {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} do not affect its behavior.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} can make better use of this equipment than most [[Survivors]], since his purchased drones and turrets will become invisible as long as they stick close to him. However, it still may not be worthwhile compared to what other equipment can do for him.
*Keep in mind that invisible allies, particularly invisible drones, will ''not'' be able to draw enemies' attention away from the player. Although the holder's allies will be relatively safe from enemy attacks, the holder may find themself on the receiving end of more aggro than they bargained for.
* Giving this equipment to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}} is a decent idea, as it will turn the player and other allies invisible and alleviate the above problem.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar Equipment|lunar equipment]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''.

Activating the Tonic will {{statusEffectLink|TonicBuff|dramatically increase}} all the player's stats for 20 seconds, but after this buff wears off there is a 20% chance to gain a {{itemLink|Tonic Affliction|altUrl=Spinel Tonic#Tonic Affliction}}; the affliction ''reduces all stats'' by 5% (''-5% per stack'') if the player is not under the Tonic's buff''.'' 
== Notes ==
* While the {{statusEffectLink|TonicBuff}} is active, the in-game character model emits dark bursts of liquid, the screen becomes tinted blue, and the camera's FOV increases.

* The stat bonuses (other than armor) for this buff are unique in that they are multipliers. For example, not only does the attack speed buff give 70% bonus attack speed, it makes all other attack speed buffs 70% stronger, so a {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}} would give 25.5% bonus attack speed instead of the normal 15%.

* The chance to get a {{itemLink|Tonic Affliction|altUrl=Spinel Tonic#Notes}} is affected by [[Luck]]. This means that with a single {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}, the player's chance to get an affliction is reduced to 4%. However, having a single {{ItemLink|Purity}} instead will increase the affliction chance to 36%.

* Having enough Tonic Afflictions can reduce a survivor's maximum health to 1 HP. Unlike {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}, further stacks do not kill the player.

* The chance to acquire an affliction is determined when the Spinel Tonic is activated. 
** The Tonic Afflictions are not given to the player until the tonic buff wears off, meaning that if the equipment is activated multiple times and then the tonic buff ends, multiple stacks of Tonic Affliction can be gained at once.
*** This can be avoided by advancing to the next stage, which removes the tonic buff without giving any Tonic Afflictions.
** The Tonic Affliction is added directly to the player's inventory.

* Tonic Afflictions can be avoided if the buff is kept up continually, and all afflictions have their effects negated while the buff is active.

== Tips ==
* The +300% regeneration applies to {{ItemLink|Cautious Slug}}, {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}, and {{SurvivorLink|Acrid|Acrid's Regenerative}} buff, making them all 4 times as powerful.
*Extremely powerful when paired with the {{ItemLink|War Horn}}, as it's 70% attack speed buff becomes 119%, and if you have 4 {{ItemLink|War Horn|War Horns}} the attack speed buff will last for the entire duration of the tonic.

*This equipment is not as effective when playing as {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}, as his turrets are not affected by the buff but still inherit all of his afflictions.

* Using the Tonic as the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}} will quickly lead to her death, since it quadruples her negative health regeneration.
**Pairing this with the {{ItemLink|Transcendence}} allows the Heretic to use the Tonic, since it sets her regeneration to 0. This comes at the cost of being unable to heal normally, however.

*It's possible to gain permanent uptime and avoid the buff wearing off by having a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} and any combination of at least 3 {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} or 3 additional {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned|altText=Gestures of the Drowned}}.

==Math ==
The Tonic Affliction debuff will reduce a victim's HP by &lt;code&gt;1 - 1 / ( 1 + 0.1 &amp;sdot; amount of afflictions)&lt;/code&gt;

All other stats are reduced by &lt;code&gt;1 - 0.95 ^ amount of afflictions&lt;/code&gt;

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When [[Interactables|interacting]] with something (with the exception of [[Scrapper]]s and {{ArtifactLink|Command|Command Essences}}), the item summons a Squid Turret with 100% ''(+100% per stack)'' attack speed that attacks nearby enemies. Each turret normally lasts 30 seconds.

== Notes ==
* The 30 second time limit is based on a constant health drain, and as such it can be either extended via healing (e.g. {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}, [[Shrine of the Woods]]), or cut short by being damaged.
* Squid turrets have 4 (+1 per level) base damage. Their attack fires every 0.75s at base attack speed for 500% damage (effectively 666% damage per second per stack) with a 0.1 [[Proc Coefficient]] and applies a knockback effect, pushing away targets with a force of 2000.
* The turrets' level is based on the ambient run level, so the turrets always spawn at the same level as enemies, not the player's level.
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Beacon: Resupply|survivorName=Captain}} can activate the Squid Polyp, as the beacon itself is an interactable. Keep in mind that each supply beacon only has 3 uses, so use them wisely.
** Note that Squid Turrets ''do not'' get {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}} from Captain's passive.
* Use {{ItemLink|Gorag's Opus}} to greatly boost all Squid Turrets' firepower for a short time.
* This item cannot be obtained in the [[Simulacrum]] mode, and will appear locked if attempting to select it with the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}.
* The turret can be possessed by a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor}}, potentially turning it into a considerable danger to a player. Care should be taken when activating a [[Void Cradle]] while carrying a Polyp, as it'll always spawn a turret along with possibly several Infestors.
* Even though the Squid Turrets have regeneration, the health drain actually overrides this and the regeneration is never normally used.

**Developer Notes: An important part of the balance of the Void Cradles is the risk from the Void Infestors it spawns, so we wanted to lower the risk with Squid Polyp without completely removing it.  These changes to Squid Polyp are overall a slight buff in the hands of the player (the knockback especially defends the turrets against infestation), but they mainly reduce the damage from Collapse when Voidtouched.  And believe it or not, they’re actually pretty good at killing the Void Infestors.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] introduced in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

This interactable is found only within a [[Void Seed]] or on {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}. It functions similar to a [[barrel]], where upon breaking it the player is rewarded with 25 [[gold]] and 0 [[Level|XP]], scaling linearly with the [[Difficulty#The Math of Scaling Difficulty|difficulty coefficient]].

==Void Marker==
&lt;span style="color:#FF69B4"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt; This content is not functioning within the game.

In the game data there is a void version of [[Lunar Coins]] and a corrupted version of a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]], called ''Void Marker'' and ''Void Eradicator'' respectively. This interactable selects a random Common item, which the player can choose to pay to ban from appearing from the rest of the run. Upon purchase it then selects a random {{Color|Uncommon}} and then a {{Color|Legendary}} item with the same effect.

Since the internal names for the Stalk and Void Marker are ''VoidCoinBarrel'' and ''VoidCoin'' respectively, this points to a scrapped idea of Stalks dropping Void Coins which could then be used on Void Eradicators. In the same way the reward from the Stalk seems to have changed from Void Markers to gold, it is also likely that the [[Void Cradle]] and [[Void Potential]], the other two interactables that appear in the vicinity of Stalks, could have initially required Void Markers as currency instead of sacrificing health.

Cooldown buffs are buffs used to indicate the cooldown of an [[Items|item]]. Cooldown buffs use their stack count as the timer, with one stack being removed each second. Cooldowns are buffs, which means that they ''cannot'' be prevented by {{ItemLink|Ben's Raincoat}}. However, they ''can'' be cleansed with {{ItemLink|Blast Shower}}.

** '''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixRed|**Fire Elites**}}'''
*** '''[Community Suggestion]''' Rework burning calculation with unique new {{StatusEffectLink|OnFire|burning}} damage type
*** Number of stacks of Burning on the player are now visible in the buff bar.
*** Burning is now capped at 5% of your health a second PER stack. Just to be clear - this is a nerf. It'll always hit for less this patch.
*** Now ticks at twice the frequency (but same overall damage).
*** This damage type has also now been applied to the Magma Worm's impact and fireball damage, alongside Elder Lemurian's fire breath
*** ''The intent here is to make it clear to the player what exactly a burn DOES, regardless of how it's applied. Players never were told by the game that burning actually stacks. If you have a certain number of burn stacks, you will now be aware of exactly how much that will hit for. Overall this should make the burns way less bursty and way more consistent, also allowing heal over time effects to help counteract the damage. The intent is NOT to make the entire game easier, or to make burns never kill you. Fire elites are the only purely offensive elite-type, so they should be causing deaths. It should just feel less BS now.''
** '''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixWhite|**Ice Elites**}}'''
*** Rework ice bomb
*** Improve graphics for ice bomb left when killed to be more clear.
*** Ice bomb damage reduced from 350% to 150%
*** Ice bomb damage is no longer reduced at the edge of the radius
*** Ice bomb now FREEZES characters in the radius for 1.5s
*** ''*Fire elites have always been the most threatening type, with the other 2 being pretty easy. The hope here is that after the nerf of the Fire affix, the Ice affix can now also be respected as a serious threat. The improved visuals should help clarify what the ice affix actually does - most players don't seem to notice it drops a bomb at all. We're starting with a low freeze duration to test how it feels.*''
** '''{{StatusEffectLink|AffixBlue|**Lightning Elites**}}'''
*** Lightning bombs from Lightning Elites now properly attach to players.
*** Lightning elites now always spawn at full shields
*** Improve lightning bomb graphics
** '''**Misc**'''
*** '''[Community Suggestion]''' Add 3 second {{StatusEffectLink|HiddenInvincibility|invincibility}} period when first spawning into a map.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Sticky Bomb|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

On hit, the holder has a 5% ''(+5% per stack)'' chance to attach a sticky bomb to an enemy. The sticky bomb explodes after 1.5 seconds, dealing 180% [[Damage#'Base' vs. 'Total' Damage|total damage]] in a 10m radius with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.0. The explosion suffers from [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot falloff]].

== Notes ==
* For reference, a 10m explosion radius is slightly smaller than the fire from 1 {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}, and twice as large as an {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] lightning bomb. 
*On attacks with proc coefficients of 1.0, and assuming the bomb does not explode after a target has died, one stack of Sticky Bomb averages out to a 9% damage increase. 
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}}'s {{SkillLink|Supercharge|Railgunner}}'s has a proc coefficient of 3.0. This means that Railgunner only needs 7 Sticky Bomb to guarantee triggering them with this ability assuming base Luck, almost tripling the already monstrous damage of this ability while giving it even more crowd-clearing potential due to the explosion's AoE and the piercing attribute creating a bomb per each target hit. {{SkillLink|Cryocharge|Railgunner}}'s instead requires about 14 stickies due to its lower 1.5 proc coefficient but can still be effective.
*An important detail to keep in mind with the Sticky Bomb when compared to other items like the {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} is the Sticky Bomb has a proc coefficient of 0.0. This means that the explosion from a Sticky Bomb will not be able to start a "proc chain", where several items trigger each other, thus stacking their damage multipliers.
**The Sticky Bomb is still an important item in these proc chains since the high-damage hits from a proc chain can themselves create a Sticky Bomb, further increasing the already ludicrous damage dealt.

}}

== Trivia ==
* The logbook entry likely references the Sticky Bomb before it was changed in the Scorched Acres update; that iteration of Sticky Bomb increased the bomb's damage as well as proc chance with every stack, so finding a Sticky Bomb [[3D Printers|3D Printer]] was often a victorious occurence.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

This item increases the holder's [[Health|maximum health]] by 100% (''+100% per stack''). However, it also decreases the holder's [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] by 50% ''(+50% per stack)''.

==Notes==

*{{color|note|Correction:}} The description that it halves movement speed is inaccurate. The effect is reciprocal as it multiplies the movement speed by &lt;math&gt;1 / (1 + stacks)&lt;/math&gt;. One stack will indeed halve movement speed, but additional stacks will have a diminishing effect. However, even this is not the complete picture, as movement speed is actually calculated as &lt;math&gt;baseValue \times sumOfIncreases / sumOfDecreases&lt;/math&gt;. As such, if the player has already accrued a lot of other sources of negative contributions, one stack of this item will '''not''' halve the overall stat value but have a diminishing effect.

==Tips ==
*For most characters and builds, keep in mind that the movement speed penalty of Stone Flux Pauldron will generally be far more troublesome than the accompanying health bonus is worth. The vast majority of enemy attacks come in the form of close-range melee, projectiles with a travel time, and telegraphed area-of-effect attacks. All these attacks also generally will not track a moving player and instead lag behind. As such, the loss of one's ability to effectively dodge these attacks and/or flee from unfavorable fights will more than likely end up meaning they'll take a ''lot'' of damage that they could have otherwise avoided. Often, the player may end up taking far more damage than the extra health of the Pauldron can defend them from.
*This speed penalty also complicates one's ability to get around each stage in order to search for [[interactables]], and as such, might make it difficult to keep up with the time-based scaling of the game's difficulty. This may be exacerbated in multiplayer games, where a player with one or more Stone Flux Pauldron(s) could have trouble getting to [[chests]] and other sources of items before the faster player(s) can pick the stage clean.
*The "suffocation" effects presented by the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}, and [[Void Seed]]s are also made far more dangerous, as their damage scales with the player's maximum health anyways. The Pauldron will not make the player survive any longer inside the void, and the movement penalty will leave them slowly trudging through ever-damaging fog.
*Similarly, the implosion attacks of dying {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}}, {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer|Void Jailers}}, and other such Void enemies will kill in one hit regardless of health, making a swift escape more or less the ''only'' option to survive them.
* Due to the mathematics of how a player's movement speed is calculated, it is generally a losing battle to try to overcome the Pauldron's speed penalty by taking items which give movement speed bonuses, ''especially'' when taking more than one Pauldron. Each one taken will more than double the number of {{ItemLink|Mocha}}, {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof|Paul's Goat Hooves}}, and {{ItemLink|Energy Drink|Energy Drinks}} necessary to break even and return to normal movement speed.
* A notable quirk revealed by the exceptionally low movement speeds possible by stacking Stone Flux Pauldrons is the fact that a player's friction with the ground is directly tied to their movement speed. As such, stacking many Pauldrons will make the player incredibly slippery, making it rather difficult to manage the knockback caused by enemy attacks (especially explosions like the {{MonsterLink|Jellyfish|Jellyfish's}} self-detonation) or the recoil from their own skills (such as {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner|Railgunner's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=XQR Smart Round System}}).
*With all these factors in mind, it may be better to cut losses with respect to movement speed and instead focus on alternative means of movement that are unaffected by the movement speed stat.
**A skilled {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} can make great use of this item, as she can rely on the momentum from her {{SkillLink|skillName=Charged Gauntlet}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Thunder Gauntlet}} to get moving, and use her {{SkillLink|skillName=Grapple Fist}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=Spiked Fist}} to redirect her momentum and close gaps between herself and nearby enemies.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T|altText|MUL-T's}} high base health and innate ability to grant itself considerable amounts of [[armor]] with its assorted skills makes it an excellent candidate for leveraging the benefits of the Stone Flux Pauldron. The push it receives from the ending burst of {{SkillLink|skillName=Auto-Nailgun}} also offers a means to compensate for the loss in movement speed, especially when used in conjunction with {{SkillLink|skillName=Power Mode}}. Timing the release of two Auto-Nailgun bursts along with a simultaneous jump allows for a directed leap that can carry the player a considerable distance, and the nailguns will usually be ready to fire again just a moment or two after hitting the ground, even without any boosts to firing speed.
**The {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=False Son|altText|False Son}} also makes great use of this item, due to the large health increase in conjunction with his Growth mechanic granting him a large amount of extra charges to {{SkillLink|skillName=Lunar Spikes}}, which then in turn allows him to offset the movespeed reduction with {{SkillLink|skillName=Lunar Tampering}}. This is especially powerful since the health increase granted by this item scales with the survivor's maximum HP, resulting in it giving even more stocks of Lunar Spike as he levels up. Additionally, with enough growth, the recoil from spamming {{SkillLink|skillName=Laser Burst}} is a potential movement option incase you need tons of speed in an instant. This is only necessary if you pick up enough Stone Flux Pauldrons to otherwise eliminate any hope of escaping commencement's detonation or the implosion of a void enemy, even with Lunar Tampering, as {{SkillLink|skillName=Step of the Brothers}} scales with movement speed and the cost of growth increases with every stack of Lunar Spikes.
**Picking up a {{ItemLink|itemName=Wax Quail}} or two will grant the player an alternate means of movement regardless of their chosen Survivor, as the boost it gives when a sprinting player jumps is calculated to send them a certain distance forwards, regardless of the player's movement speed. Do keep in mind that having too many Quails may make it difficult to make precise movements, especially with the implicit reduction in friction.
**With the {{ItemLink|itemName=H3AD-5T v2}}, the item's ability to crash down to the ground after holding the interact key will allow for the player to halt their momentum in mid-air, should they need to. The item's extra effect of negating all fall damage is also especially helpful in this scenario: The player's low traction and reliance on less-controllable means of movement will make falling off of ledges much more common, and fall damage is calculated as a percentage of the player's health, making it hit harder for high-health players.
**On all survivors, jumping without providing any directional input (WASD/movement stick) will completely halt any non-vertical momentum. This gives a player with several Stone Flux Pauldrons a consistent means to slow down without having to rely on their immensely reduced friction, so long as they are on the ground to start with.
*The Stone Flux Pauldron's health boost synergizes best with items and abilities that benefit from the player taking damage, help the extra health last longer, aid with healing, and/or scale positively with the player's maximum health. 
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} and especially {{ItemLink|itemName=Razorwire}} are quintessential for their ability to benefit from the player being damaged, supplying a tanky player with exceptional sources of gold and damage output, respectively.
**Although helpful at first, items that grant flat healing, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Harvester's Scythe}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Leeching Seed}}, will quickly be outstripped by the comparatively massive pool of maximum health that stacking several Stone Flux Pauldrons can offer. Instead, it's generally better to focus on items and equipment that heal for a ''percentage'' of maximum health, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Medkit}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Interstellar Desk Plant}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Foreign Fruit}}.
**Similarly, the flat damage reduction of {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Planula}} will be dwarfed by the damage of heftier blows that are normally much easier to dodge; for this, consider pursuing items that instead boost armor, such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Jade Elephant}}.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}} and {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} are uniquely powerful in combination with Stone Flux Pauldron, as they are the only means of offense with a damage output that scales with the user's maximum health instead of their base damage stat. A massive health pool from the Pauldron will give a correspondingly massive damage boost for both of these items.
*Since this is the only item that reduces movement speed (excluding {{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction}}), the Stone Flux Pauldron can be used in long runs where a player is overwhelmed by extreme levels of speed, making movement much easier to manage.&lt;!-- You gotta check how pads and transcendence work together with multiple copies, they work perfectly well with a single copy but it seems there is some flubble with multiples.

{{MonsterPage}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[ror:Rock Golem|returning]] stone construct [[Monsters|monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Golem}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 30% of the Stone Golem's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Seismic Slam ===
The Stone Golem can slam its fists together which creates an explosion dealing 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 5.5m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear]] falloff.

Using this attack will not disrupt the Golem's laser charging. This attack has an animation duration of 2 seconds and is completely unaffected by [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]].

This skill has a cooldown of 1 second.
=== Secondary: Laser Attack ===
The Stone Golem uses a slow-charging laser attack from its eye that tracks the player for 3 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]). The laser then explodes dealing 250% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 4m with sweet spot falloff. The explosion occurs at the end point of the laser beam. This attack also deals knockback with a force of 5000 and has an end lag of 2 seconds (scales with attack speed). 

The Stone Golem is able to use his primary attack while the laser is charging. 

The laser is blocked by physical objects, but it will still charge and track its target even if line of sight is broken.

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds, which starts only after the laser has exploded.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Stone Golem must be within 6m from its target.
# '''Use secondary''': the Stone Golem must be within 10-45m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* The laser can be avoided with a well-timed dodge, or if the player is hidden behind a physical object. Having high enough movement speed can also allow the player to avoid it if they dash to the side. Because they cannot turn quickly without jumping, hiding behind the golem will work as well.
* The melee attack can be easily avoided by keeping space or dodging, but keep in mind that it will damage the player regardless of which way the Stone Golem is facing.

* Even though the primary skill itself is not affected by attack speed, the sound that it plays will be sped up.

{{MonsterPage}}

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] introduced in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Golem}} monster family. Being a Boss, the Stone Titan may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher [[Difficulty|difficulties]].

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
=== Secondary: Stone Fist ===
The Titan bends downwards and forces its fist into the ground, which erupts at the player's location, inflicting damage and launching them high into the air. The Titan begins by tracking the target for 0.5 seconds to predict their movement and then a fire ring appears at the predicted location from where the first appears after 1.5 seconds. The fire ring can be blocked by {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|Captain|Captain's Defensive Microbots|altImg=Defensive Microbots (Skill)}} before the fist appears. This attack has an end lag of 4.2 seconds. 

The attack deals 100% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 5.5m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]]. The launching force varies between 3000 and 4000, depending on the player's vector from the center of the explosion. Note that the fire ring indicator has a slightly smaller radius than the attack covers. &lt;!-- probably 5m --&gt;

The skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds. 

=== Utility: Stone Construct ===
The Titan summons a glowing cluster of rocks above it, which periodically fires homing lasers towards targets. The summoning lasts for 9 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]), after which the Titan will be able to move and attack again. The construct will attempt to maintain its position above the Stone Titan's head, even adjusting its position as the boss bends down to perform its Stone Fist attack.

The stone construct lasts 25 seconds and fires the first laser after a 6 second delay. It then fires every 1.5 seconds for a total of 13 shots. Each laser moves at 50m/s and deals 30% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0. The skill has a cooldown of 40 seconds. 
=== Special: Eye Laser ===
The Titan fires a laser from its eye after charging it for 3 seconds (scales with attack speed), inflicting heavy continuous damage to its target. While the laser is charging, a small red laser aims towards the player as an indication that they're being targeted. The laser locks onto the target and will not switch to a different one during its duration until the target has died, even if the target becomes{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Cloak|altText=invisible}} or the laser is momentarily blocked by cover.

The skill deals 24 x 12.5% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.15 per tick over 3 seconds, and it has a cooldown of 20 seconds. These laser ticks have [[Damage#Damage Falloff|default damage falloff]].

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special''': the Titan must be within 20-80m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 95% health. The minimum range means the Titan will not use the Laser if the target is very close to it.
# '''Use utility''': the Titan must be within 90m from its target and have less than 60% health.
# '''Use secondary''': the Titan must be within 200m from its target.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Loot ==
''Main Article: {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}''

If the Stone Titan is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Stone Titan) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Titanic Knurl}}.

== Tips ==
* When fighting Stone Titans, the player's greatest survival tool is the terrain itself. The Eye Laser is its most powerful attack, so it is essential to hold a position close to obstacles which can break the Titan's line of sight while firing at the player. This is especially important for [[Survivors]] with poor (or a lack of) movement skills, such as {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} and {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} .
** If there are multiple Titans, the player can use one to block the Eye Laser of another.
** If there is no cover in sight, the player can strafe the Titan at very close distances. Staying close can prevent it from using the Eye Laser at all, and even if it does use the attack, it may not be able to rotate fast enough to keep contact with the beam.
* Another method of avoiding the Eye Laser is to bring in a collection of [[Interactibles#Drones|Drones]] to use as distractions while attacking the boss. Players should still be mindful, however, as the Stone Titan's laser can sharply divert its attention back to the player after destroying a drone.
* {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} can massively reduce the damage of the Eye Laser, making the attack far less of a threat.
* The Stone Titan's Stone Fist attack can be used in tandem with its Eye Laser, leading to a deadly combo where the Titan launches players up into the air and lasers them in their defenseless airborne state. Even when hiding behind cover from the Eye Laser, players must make an effort to stay on the move.
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} excels at fighting Stone Titans, as his {{SkillLink|Bubble Shield|Engineer}} blocks both of the Titan's projectile attacks. 
**With that in mind, players inside a shield are still vulnerable to the Stone Fist attack, which can also launch them out of the shielded area and expose them to lasers. Unlike players, however, Engineer's {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|Turrets}} cannot be launched.
*Despite the Titan's colossal stature, it possesses no melee attacks, and none of its attacks are any stronger point-blank than they are at longer ranges. This makes it relatively safe to fight it up close since it will additionally not use its eye laser as long as the target circles its legs.

== Trivia ==
* The Stone Titan is a possible successor to the [[Ror:Colossus|Colossus]], a boss in Risk of Rain 1 that shares the stone theme and has a similar appearance. The Colossus may have been replaced due its gargantuan size possibly being a challenge to work around in 3D.
** In [[Distant Roost]], the silhouette of a massive, dormant Colossus can sometimes be visible off in the distance. This is clearly intentional as an Easter egg or [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag development gag] by the developers.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]'' and an original part of the [[Heretic|Heresy Set]].

Obtaining the Strides of Heresy will replace the [[Survivors|Survivor's]] utility skill (Shift by default on keyboard) with the Shadowfade skill.
__TOC__
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{SkillType|Utility|{{Skill
| name     = Shadowfade
| type     = Utility
| cooldown = 6s after the effect ends
| proc     = 
| notes    = 
* {{Color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of healing 25% max health is incorrect. Instead, it gives 1.3% max health per tick for 14 ticks, for a total of 18.2% max health per activation, per stack.
* The player can fly during the skill's duration if activating it in midair.
* The invulnerable period cannot be cancelled early.
* While invulnerable, the player can still interact with things and activate their [[Items#Active Items|equipment]], but cannot use any skills.
* The player's hitbox is removed while invulnerable, so even a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|altText=Void Reaver's}} implosion can be avoided.
}}
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Notes ==
* Shadowfade's duration is increased with additional Strides of Heresy. High stacks can result in more time out of reality than in, which can result in a DPS loss. Combining this item with {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} can balance Strides’ lack of damage effectively.
* Shadowfade will ''not'' prevent damage from [[Shrine of Blood|Shrines of Blood]] or environmental damage such as fall damage or suffocation damage in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}.
* Shadowfade does not remove [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage over time]] effects when activated.
* Entering a wormhole from the {{ItemLink|Eccentric Vase}} immediately ends the duration of Shadowfade.
*Obtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the {{EntityLink|entityName=Heretic}}.

== Tips ==
* This item is especially useful for {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} and {{SurvivorLink|REX}} (without their alternate utility skill unlocked), since Shadowfade is arguably an upgrade over their default utility skills.
* {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}, {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}, and {{SurvivorLink|Captain}} have their damage outputs substantially lowered with their utility skills replaced.
** Loader’s utility skill accounts for the majority of her damage output; taking Strides of Heresy significantly reduces Loader’s overall damage.
* {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}} gives up {{SkillLink|skillName=Snapfreeze|survivorName=Artificer}} for Shadowfade but can take unique advantage of the flight effect with her {{SkillLink|ENV Suit|Artificer}}. Hovering throughout the cooldown effectively grants her slow but unlimited flight without {{SkillLink|skillName=Ion Surge|survivorName=Artificer}}.
** Shadowfade’s invulnerability, healing, and mobility offer a strong, defensive alternative to Artificer’s default utility.
* For all other characters, such as {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} and {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}}, the benefits of this item are questionable and up to user preference.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

On hit, it gives a 5% ''(+5% per stack)'' chance to stun most non-boss enemies, interrupting most attacks and locking them in place for 2 seconds. 

== Notes ==
* The Stun Grenade is one of the few items in the game with [[Item Stacking#Hyperbolic Stacking|hyperbolic stacking]].

* The chance to trigger is multiplied by the [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of the attack.

== Tips ==
* {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}} can utilize the Stun Grenade well, since his primary {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap|survivorName=Commando}} deals rapid damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. This also makes {{SkillLink|skillName=Suppressive Fire|survivorName=Commando}} irrelevant when it comes to stunning enemies, as Double Tap has no cooldown and should easily proc the Stun Grenade from time to time.
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} can use the Stun Grenade similarly with {{SkillLink|skillName=Auto-Nailgun|survivorName=MUL-T}}, although this has a lower proc coefficient and much wider spread. 
* Stunning an enemy is not considered a debuff, and thus does not contribute towards {{ItemLink|itemName=Death Mark}}.
*Stunning an already stunned enemy resets the time stunned back to 2 seconds rather than stacking in overall duration.

== Math ==
The chance to activate is determined by the formula: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \Bigl(1 - \frac{1}{0.05x + 1}\Bigr)
= \frac{0.05x}{0.05x + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the amount.

The '''Sundered Grove''' is a dense, floral, jungle stage located on [[Petrichor V]], and is a part of the fourth set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2''.

This stage was initially a timed exclusive for [https://stadia.google.com/ Stadia], the Google game streaming platform. It was added to the PC version on November 3, 2020 ([[PC Patch v1.0.2.0]]).

''Explore the new Sundered Grove, where ancient flora has risen up to reclaim this once sacred refuge. Mazes of roots and overgrown fungus have twisted the landscape, leaving only ruins. Battle through the lofty canopy to the deep underground. Sundered Grove will accompany [[Abyssal Depths]] and [[Siren's Call|Siren’s Call]] as an alternate fourth stage where survivors will search the entangled area for the legendary chest.''

* This equipment pairs extremely well with {{SurvivorLink|REX}}, allowing them to recoup HP used to cast their skills.
* For many survivors, this equipment pairs very well with {{ItemLink|War Horn}} as one stack of it will last the same amount of time as the leech, increasing damage dealt and health healed.
* Pair the Leech with {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} to turn the Leech's healing into even more damage.
* Bonus multipliers to damage, such as those from [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strikes]] or the {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}}, are ''not'' considered when calculating healing. For instance, a hit that deals 100 damage, boosted to 120 by the Focus Crystal, will only heal 20 HP (not 24).
* The Leech also does not grant healing from damage-over-time sources such as {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}} from the {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}.

Players start with only the {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} and {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} ([[Railgunner]] and [[Seeker]] are also available from start with [[Survivors of the Void|Survivor of the Void]], and [[Seekers of the Storm]] DLC respectively), and can unlock the rest by accomplishing various [[Challenges]]. Survivors are known as such due to the result of a space-bound catastrophe, although in RoR2 the case is revealed by the game's lore to be on a rescue mission aboard the UES Safe Travels, sent to look for the remains of RoR1's UES Contact Light. In this case, it's likely the name "Survivor" is used simply because it was also used in RoR1, not because it has significance to the plot of RoR2.

There are currently seventeen playable Survivors (the [[Railgunner]] and [[Void Fiend]] being available in the DLC [[Survivors of the Void]])  ([[Chef]], [[Seeker]] and [[False Son]]  being available in the new DLC [[Seekers of the Storm]])

&lt;!-- @editors, this can be the informal community patch notes while we wait for official patch notes (if they're even coming).

==Environment Changes==
* {{EnvironmentLink|Sundered Grove}}
** Soundtrack changed from Nocturnal Emission to They Might As Well Be Dead
* {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}
** Timer does not pause while in [[Void Fields]].
** Cell Vents now drop a [[Void Potential]], giving a choice of three items, instead of dropping a random item. Item choices can differ in rarity.
* Damage over time in the Void now scales with level and is no longer reduced by damage reduction from items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate|boxIcon=true}} and cannot be blocked from items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times|boxIcon=true}}.

==Survivor Changes==
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}'''
**{{SkillLink|Vicious Wounds|Acrid}}
*** Can no longer animation cancel the first attack by sprinting. Instead, sprinting will immediately start the next attack in the primary chain.
**{{SkillLink|skillName=Caustic Leap|survivorName=Acrid}} &amp; {{SkillLink|skillName=Frenzied Leap|survivorName=Acrid}}
***No longer collides with enemies.
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}'''
**{{SkillLink|Flame Bolt|Artificer}} &amp; {{SkillLink|Plasma Bolt|Artificer}} 
***Added UI element next to reticle for the number of charges left.
** {{SkillLink|Charged Nano-Bomb|Artificer}} &amp; {{SkillLink|Cast Nano-Spear|Artificer}}
***Now require releasing and pressing the button again to recast the skill.
**{{SkillLink|Flamethrower|Artificer}}
*** Damage per tick: 95%  ⇒ 100%
***Total raw damage: 2095% ⇒ 2200% &lt;br&gt; ''Note that the tooltip has been updated with 1700% ⇒ 2000%, however, the value is still incorrect in both cases.''
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Captain}}'''
** {{SkillLink|OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike|Captain}}
***Can now damage allies.
*'''{{SurvivorLink|Commando}}'''
** New character select animation.
** {{SkillLink|Suppressive Fire|Commando}}
***Now requires releasing and pressing the button again to recast the skill.
&lt;!--** Grenade physics reverted to pre-[[Anniversary Update]].|Needs more confirmation, but I'm pretty sure this is true--&gt;

==Mechanic Changes==
*Burn [[Status Effects|Status Effect]] now deal damage over time based on a percentage of the target's health. Prior to this change, burn DoT was capped based on a percentage of the target's health, resulting in more damage dealt to players with higher health than lower health.&lt;ref name="burn"&gt;"Burns work differently now.  Before, per-tick damage was capped for burning players based upon percentage of health, so higher health survivors actually took more total damage from burns.  But actually only some of the time; it was inconsistent.  Now ALL burns work the same way:  they deal damage from a total pool in increments based upon a percentage of the target's health.  The effect is that the same burn will last longer on targets with lower max health than on targets with higher max health" - BenHG#7784 [https://discord.com/channels/417739215355510784/559901542787055636/948659025569013871 Source]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Teleporter sounds are more distinct.

==Interactable Changes==
*New snow and sand variants for all shrines.
*Introduced large variants of damage, healing, and utility chests.
*Cleansing pools are more common.

==QoL Changes==
*New health bar indicator for when low health items will activate when carrying these items (e.g. {{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit}}).
* Health bars now visually indicate how much health was healed from healing sources.
*Lobbies remember the last played character instead of defaulting to Commando.
*New visual in [[Eclipse]] game mode screen that shows number of eclipse levels completed per survivor, as well as golden variants for having completed the level of eclipse on every survivor. &lt;br&gt; ''For example, completing eclipse 1 on commando will highlight it blue when playing as commando. But completing eclipse 1 on every survivor will highlight it gold.''

== Item Changes==
* '''{{ItemLink|Energy Drink}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"Sprint faster."'' to ''"Increase sprint speed by +25%."''
* '''{{ItemLink|Gasoline}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"Killing enemies sets nearby enemies on fire."'' to ''"Killing an enemy ignites other nearby enemies."''
* '''{{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"Chance to 'Critically Strike', dealing double damage."'' to ''"Gain 10% chance for hits to 'Critically Strike', dealing double damage."''
* '''{{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"Move faster."'' to ''"Increase movement speed."''
* '''{{ItemLink|Rusted Key}}'''
** Rusty Lockbox now can spawn in the Void Fields.
** Rusty Lockbox now always drops a legendary item. This is a confirmed bug.&lt;ref&gt;Dev Thoughts 26.5 https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/3114807061130869250&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''{{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"Chance to bleed enemies on hit."'' to ''"Gain +10% chance to bleed enemies on hit."''
* '''{{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"Increases attack speed."'' to ''"Increase attack speed."''
&lt;!--* Death mark requires 3 debuffs instead of 4.|Needs more confirmation. In-game effect is still the same (4 debuffs), but I have definitely seen it go off with 3 or even 2--&gt;
* '''{{ItemLink|Berzerker's Pauldron}}'''
** Fixed the tooltip saying that the wielder needs 3 kills instead of 4 to trigger its effect.
* '''{{ItemLink|Interstellar Desk Plant}}'''
** Tooltip has been updated from ''"heals for 5% maximum health every 0.5 seconds"'' to ''"heals for 10% maximum health every second"''. &lt;br&gt; ''Note that the 5m base radius in the tooltip is still incorrect.''
** The tick rate of the healing is not changed.
* '''{{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}'''
**Taking damage now surrenders the gold to the attacker, rather than being lost entirely. &lt;br&gt; ''This means that damage dealt by [[Shrine of Blood]] or [[REX|REX's]] plant skills will be refunded back, since the attacker is the player.''
**Tooltip has been updated from ''"Gain gold on hit... {{Color|#FF7F7F|BUT lose gold on getting hit.}}"''  to "Gain gold on hit... {{Color|#FF7F7F|BUT surrender gold on getting hit.}}"
*'''{{ItemLink|itemName=Volcanic Egg}}'''

*{{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} and {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} now properly work in [[Bulwark's Ambry]].

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

On hit, it has a 100% chance (multiplied by the hit's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]) to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|PermanentDebuff}} on the target, permanently decreasing the victim's [[armor]] by 2 ''(+2 per stack)''.

== Notes ==

* Although the wording of "permanent" makes the item's effect sound rather unforgiving, any stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|PermanentDebuff}} that a player or ally might have accumulated over the course of a stage will be removed when they move on to the next stage, or are revived, similar to the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Permanent Curse}} debuff from [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse Levels|Eclipse 8]].

== Tips ==
* Keep in mind that negative [[armor]] has an asymptotic cap of +100% damage taken, meaning that inflicting more stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|PermanentDebuff}} generally has diminishing returns.
** However, an exception to this is monsters which can gain a large amount of extra armor under certain circumstances, such as {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider|Clay Dunestriders}}, {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}}, and {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}. With enough stacks of this item's debuff, these monsters' additional armor can be negated, allowing them to take significantly more damage than normal in these circumstances.
*Although the effects of Symbiotic Scorpion and {{ItemLink|itemName=Shattering Justice}} are similar, which one is more effective for a given player will depend on their survivor and build. Those focused on stacking up proc effects in order to steadily whittle enemies down would be better off with the Scorpion, whereas those with a focus on heavy hits and burst damage might prefer {{ItemLink|itemName=Shattering Justice}}.
*This item can be incredibly dangerous if discovered by a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}}, stolen by {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}}, or given to the monsters on the final stage of the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}}, as practically every hit the [[Survivors]] take from the holder(s) will increase the damage they'll take from ''all attacks'' for the full remainder of the stage.
**Similar precautions should be taken when playing with {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}}, {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}}, and/or {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}. Chaos and Vengeance can make it dangerous for the players to pick up Symbiotic Scorpion, and Evolution could give one or more to all enemies the player(s) might encounter.
*Despite being a debuff, Symbiotic Scorpion's armor reduction is not removed by the effects of {{ItemLink|itemName=Blast Shower}}.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Ben's Raincoat}} prevents the accumulation of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=PermanentDebuff|altText=Permanent Armor Reduction}} stacks, but will not remove stacks that were in place prior to its collection.

*The logbook entry for the Symbiotic Scorpion briefly references a popular line from the ''Lord of the Rings'' films in which Samwise Gamgee talks about ways to cook potatoes: "Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew."
** It may also be a homage to ''Breaking Bad'', in a brief exchange between Walter and his son, where Walter Jr. describes killing bullies by burying them under a pile of scorpions.

The '''TC-280 Prototype''' is a rare [[Interactibles#Drones|drone]] found only on {{EntityLink|entityName=Rallypoint Delta}}. It is the strongest offensive drone the player can acquire, but also the most expensive by far, costing almost as much [[gold]] as a [[Chests#Legendary Chest|legendary chest]].

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
===Primary: Machine Gun===
The Prototype fires 15 shots over 2 seconds, each dealing 220% damage with 1.0 proc coefficient and [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear falloff]].

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds.

===Secondary: Missiles===
The Prototype fires two missiles moving at 55m/s in a straight line. They explode upon impact, dealing 400% damage with 1.0 proc coefficient in a radius of 8m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|linear falloff]].

This skill has a cooldown of 6 seconds, and the Prototype can store two charges of this skill. They have 1.5 seconds delay between activations and they can be used while the machine gun is firing.  

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Stay close to owner''': the Prototype must be more than 180m away from its owner, who must be alive. This behavior is active for 4 seconds.
# '''Use primary and stop when near target''': the Prototype must be within 20m from its target and have line of sight. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and the Prototype will refresh its enemy target at the end of it. Most enemies that prefer to keep their target at a certain distance tend to back up when nearer than that, but the Prototype behaves differently.
# '''Use primary while strafing''': the Prototype must be within 20-60m from its target and have line of sight. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and the Prototype will refresh its enemy target at the end of it.
# '''Use secondary''': the Prototype must be within 20-90m from its target and have line of sight. The prototype will refresh its enemy target at the end of it.
# '''Use primary from distance''': the Prototype must be within 20-90m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2 seconds and the Prototype will refresh its enemy target at the end of it.
# '''Strafe owner idly''': the Prototype must be within 30m from its owner who must be alive. This behavior is mostly used when there are no enemies around.
# '''Go to owner''': the owner must be alive. This behavior is mostly used when there are no enemies around. The Prototype will search for a new target at the end of it.
# '''Use primary when owner is dead''': no requirements on the enemy target distance. The primary is not necessary to be off cooldown. Despite its description, the Prototype can still use its secondary if the target is within the distance requirements. This behavior exists because the Prototype has a tendency to be near its owner when it has no targets. When the owner is dead, it will simply chase down its currently acquired target and then engage in combat according to the prior behaviors.

==Trivia==
* The TC-280 has collision on its central body, allowing players to stand on it. However, it may be difficult to stay there due to how the drone moves around.
* When a TC-280 is destroyed, it does not leave behind a broken version of itself to be repaired and is lost forever.
*It is possible to find multiple TC-280 Prototypes in the same stage, although it is uncommon.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a unique circular [[Interactables|interactable]] located in all main [[Environments]]. Finding and activating the Teleporter is the major objective in each main stage. To assist the player in locating it, the orange particles it emits can be seen from a distance, and it seems to emit a very faint tune. 

The Teleporter allows the player (and other players if playing in multiplayer) to travel to the next Environment when fully charged.

One Teleporter will spawn on each Environment. The Teleporter can spawn anywhere an interactable could be placed, provided that there is enough space for it in that location. The Teleporter will always attempt to spawn far away from the player's spawn location, and is prohibited from spawning in various areas in certain maps. 

Some Teleporter locations may result in it to be partially hidden in dark areas or even found clipping through terrain or objects.  The slow-moving particle effects in the air can greatly assist with finding the teleporter, as most background particles are always moving towards it.

{{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}} and {{EnvironmentLink|Helminth Hatchery}} have a unique Teleporter, called the Primordial Teleporter, which can be used to access {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}} and the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}}. Rings on the outside of the Teleporter can be interacted with prior to starting the Teleporter Event to either align with the moon, accessing Commencement, or to align with the planet, which [[Environments#Looping|loops]] the player back to one of the first stages.

== Teleporter Event ==
Activating and completing a '''Teleporter Event''' is the primary mean of advancing the game. 

=== Initiation ===
After locating the Teleporter, interacting with it will start the Teleporter Event. The message "You activated the {{Color|#F07878|Teleporter}}" appears. Multiple monsters spawn immediately, along with the Teleporter Boss to defeat. A red dome appears, roughly 120 meters in diameter, demarcating the effective area of the Teleporter and locking all interactables outside its radius (with the exception of [[Barrel]]s and [[Scrapper]]s). The Teleporter begins to charge, indicated by the objective "Charge the {{Color|#F07878|Teleporter}}(% progress)".

=== Teleporter Boss ===
''{{Color|Grey|Not to be confused with [[Monsters#Bosses|Bosses]], a tier of Monsters}}''.

The Teleporter Boss consists of one or several [[Monsters#Bosses|Bosses]], depending on the difficulty and number of players. Bosses and Elites that serve as the Teleporter Boss can be identified by their distinctive red health bar.

Occasionally, a Horde of Many will spawn in place of a boss(es), consisting of several Elite non-boss monsters. For a more in-depth explanation of what causes this, consult the [[Directors#Teleporter Boss|Directors]] page.

===Completion ===
In order to complete the Teleporter Event, the Teleporter Boss(es) must be killed and the Teleporter must be fully charged.

The Teleporter charges as long as the player(s) is in its dome. Once the Teleporter is charged to 99%, no more monsters will spawn naturally in the current Environment. The charging rate scales linearly with the number of players standing inside the red dome, out of the total number of players currently alive. Charging the Teleporter requires a minimum of 90 seconds if all living players always stay within the red dome. The amount of time to charge the Teleporter is reduced based on the amount of {{ItemLink|Focused Convergence}} the party has.

Once the Teleporter is fully charged and the Teleporter boss is dead, the red dome will disappear and interactables on the map will be unlocked. Any [[Teleporter#Orbs &amp; Portals|Orb]] orbiting the Teleporter will form its corresponding [[Teleporter#Orbs &amp; Portals|Portal]]. Interacting again with the Teleporter will take the player(s) to the next main environment.

==Primordial Teleporter==
The Primordial Teleporter is an interactable located only in {{EnvironmentLink|Sky Meadow}}. It has a distinctly different appearance from a regular Teleporter, featuring a spiral of eight flat, rectangular spires of escalating sizes that are bent inwards towards the center of the Teleporter's base.

The main function that differentiates the Primordial Teleporter from a regular one is that its outer ring can be interacted with to determine whether the player will travel to {{EnvironmentLink|Commencement}}, or [[Environments#Looping|loop]] back to the first stage.

Interacting with the rectangular spires away from the center of the Teleporter will prompt an animation, shifting the ending location of the Teleporter as well as changing its appearance. When the spires are in their default state of a near-circular spiral, the Teleporter will be "aligned to the moon" and will send players to Commencement. When the spires are shifted and rotate into two large clumps on opposite sides of each other that resemble the "horns" on a standard Teleporter, it will be "aligned to the planet" and will send the player back to the first stage.

Regardless of the Teleporter's alignment, using a Blue Portal will, after the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, send the player back to the first stage. The same will happen with a Gold Portal, after the {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}, and with the Artifact Portal, after the Artifact Reliquary.

&lt;gallery class="nobackground" mode="packed" widths="320" heights="180"&gt;
File:Primordial Teleporter - Aligned to The Moon.jpg|A Primordial teleporter "aligned to the moon;" sends the player to Commencement.
File:Primordial Teleporter - Aligned to The Planet.jpg|A Primordial teleporter "aligned to the planet;" loops the player back to the first stage.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Drops==
One random {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[Items#Uncommon|item]] will drop from the Teleporter after the Teleporter Boss has been defeated. In multiplayer, one item will drop per player, even for dead players. For each [[Shrine of the Mountain]] that was active, 100% more items will drop. In either case, all the uncommon items dropped are the same; the Teleporter will never drop multiple different uncommon items at once.

If the Teleporter Boss was a monster with a corresponding {{Color|boss|Boss}} [[Items#Boss|item]], each uncommon item dropped has a 15% chance to be replaced with that boss item instead. If the Teleporter Boss was a Horde of Many or a Scavenger (who has no boss item), then all the items will be uncommon.

==Orbs &amp; Portals==
Achieving specific actions before starting the Teleporter Event will spawn Orbs that will orbit around the Teleporter. Upon completing the Teleporter Event, each Orb will transform into its corresponding Portal, leading to different [[Hidden Realms]]. 

*A Blue Orb will spawn when activating a [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]]. It also has a chance to randomly spawn at the beginning of each stage, though this chance is decreased for each Blue Orb that has been spawned during the run. It will transform into a Blue Portal leading to the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}.
* A Golden Orb will spawn when activating an [[Altar of Gold]]. It will transform into a Golden Portal leading to {{EnvironmentLink|Gilded Coast}}.
*A Celestial Orb will spawn on the third stage ({{EnvironmentLink|Rallypoint Delta}}/{{EnvironmentLink|Scorched Acres}}/{{EnvironmentLink|Sulfur Pools}}) after the first loop. It will transform into a Celestial Portal leading to {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured}}.
*A Purple Orb Can spawn at random or spawn after beating {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}. It will transform into a Void Portal leading to the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}.

Multiple Orbs can be spawned on a single Teleporter, allowing for multiple Portals to spawn. However, players will only be able to use one of the Portals (or the Teleporter itself).

Players may still be able to activate a Portal after initially activating the Teleporter during the delay between actually being teleported, changing the course to the portal's target, instead of the Teleporter's.&lt;!-- This might be false! A couple things need testing with this theoretical assumption:
Activating a Portal before the teleporter, then activating the Teleporter
Activate a portal after activating a separate portal
Activate two different portals/teleporter pedestal multiple times
Replicate activating the teleporter to leave then activating a teleporter to change course.

Verifying all of these will clean up any possible confusions and allow us to gain all the knowledge on this subject
- Penultimate Chimera --&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Challenge of the Mountain==
''Main article: [[Shrine of the Mountain]]''

Upon activating a [[Shrine of the Mountain]], the difficulty of the Teleporter Event will be increased. For each shrine active, the [[Directors|director]] of the Teleporter Event will gain 100% more credits, but the Teleporter will also drop 100% more items as a reward for beating the bosses.

==Prismatic Trial==
''Main article: [[Prismatic Trial]]''

The two Teleporters in Prismatic Trials are unique in that they instantly charge once the boss is defeated. Additionally, the player cannot activate the Teleporter until they have destroyed at least three Time Crystals. 

The second stage's Teleporter Boss will always be an Elite.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of the {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}}. 

On hit, the item gives a 5% (''+5% per stack'') chance to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|Nullified}} on the target for 1 second (''+1 second per stack''), reducing their movement speed to 0. The chance to Nullify a target is multiplied by the hit's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]. 

== Notes ==
* Just because an enemy is Nullified does not mean it cannot move at all; flying enemies can still ascend and descend, and other modes of movement such as the {{MonsterLink|Parent|Parent's}} teleportation still function normally.

==Tips ==
* While {{StatusEffectLink|Nullified}} targets may help players immobilize enemies, the loss of guaranteed {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow60|altText=slow}} from the {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}} can make activating {{ItemLink|Death Mark}} more challenging without more stacks of Tentabauble.
* Like most status conditions, the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|final boss}} is not immune to the Nullified status. With enough stacks or a high fire rate, it is possible to lock him in place repeatedly.
** Note that his dash skill cures all his debuffs and can be used even when Nullified, giving him a way to break free.
* Although the Tentabauble's chance to Nullify an enemy is hyperbolic, the increased duration means that it can still see increasing returns, not diminishing, with high stacks. 
** This is in stark contrast to the Chronobauble, which is generally useless past the first stack.

== Math ==
The base chance to Nullify a target can be found with 1 - 1 / (1 + 0.05 &amp;sdot; amount)

''"Backup" redirects here. For the common item, see {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}}.''

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:The Back-up|returning]] [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When activated, it summons 4 Strike Drones that follow the player and attack nearby enemies with fast-firing machine guns. After 25 to 28 seconds, the Strike Drones automatically self-destruct.

== Notes ==

* The Strike Drone is the only ally that does not scale with the [[Difficulty#Effect on enemy level|monster level]], but instead with the player level. As such, it deals less damage as time passes, since monsters level up faster than the player. This is most likely a bug.
** It is worth noting that Strike Drones spawned by an [[Equipment Drone]] or a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}} will be at ambient level, since their summoner also scales accordingly.

== Tips ==
* This equipment is extremely beneficial for {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}, since his {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots|Captain|altText=passive skill|altImg=Defensive Microbots (Skill)}} grants every Strike Drone {{ItemLink|Defensive Microbots}} until their duration runs out.

* Giving The Back-up to an [[Equipment Drone]] is quite useful, since the drone itself will activate the equipment when enemies are near. Both the Equipment Drone and Strike Drones will follow the player nearly all the time, since the Equipment Drone reduces its equipment's cooldown by about 80%.
** This is especially useful as Captain, as the Equipment Drone ''and'' the Strike Drones will get Defensive Microbots.

* Due to its 100 second cooldown, it's best to use this against a horde of enemies or during the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], as the drones have a high rate of fire and can draw enemies' attention.

* This item has a hard limit of 20 drones that can be active at any one time. This cap is affected by other drones the player already has, and activating it will no longer have any effect if they have 20 drones already.

* It's possible to gain permanent uptime of the drones by having a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} and at least five {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}}.
** Interestingly, this equipment can still benefit from gathering more Gestures and/or Fuel Cells even after permanent uptime is achieved, since more than 4 drones can be summoned at once.

== Trivia ==
* Prior to the Anniversary Update, the Strike Drones shared the same model as the {{EntityLink|Missile Drone}}.

* The Back-up has a retro "walkie talkie" styled LCD screen, which can be read if examined in the logbook. It has a signal strength (or battery) indicator at the top, says that it's connected to Channel 2, and is set to 0/100 Voice Mod SVL (presumably standing for sound velocity levels).

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by beating the game on {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}} difficulty.

To count for the challenge, the run must be considered a victory, which requires escaping [[Commencement]]. Ending the run by [[Obliterate|obliterating]] or completing [[The Planetarium]] will not count for the challenge, since these give a "Fate Unknown..." ending.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2.

It is different from most equipment in that it has no cooldown; instead, activating the Crowdfunder toggles it between an "on" and "off" state. When activated, the Crowdfunder will fire 3 shots per second, slowly increasing its fire rate over 10 seconds and visibly spinning faster. Once spun up, it fires 15 shots per second. Each bullet fired from the Crowdfunder deals 100% damage with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|default damage falloff]] and a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0, but also costs the holder 1 gold per shot (though this cost scales with the holder's level).

If the holder has no gold remaining, the Crowdfunder stops firing, but will immediately begin firing again once the holder gains enough gold to finance it.

== Notes ==
* {{color|note|Correction:}} The in-game description of ''Cost increases over time.'' is incorrect. The cost of each shot fired is equal to: &lt;math&gt;1 + (player level - 1)/4&lt;/math&gt;
* The Crowdfunder's attacks are actually hitscans; the "bullets" fired are purely visual.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Fuel Cell}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Bottled Chaos}} have no effect when using the Crowdfunder. 
**This makes it an especially good equipment option when using {{ItemLink|itemName=Lysate Cell|altText=Lysate Cells}}.
*Having a {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} causes the Crowdfunder to always be active. This can make it difficult to buy anything, as the player is constantly losing gold. This is particularly problematic in the early game, when players likely do not have the firepower to rapidly kill monsters (and the monsters do not drop much gold anyways), but it becomes less of an issue late game due to difficulty scaling, as mentioned previously.

== Tips ==
* Although giving up gold for damage may not initially seem like a good tradeoff, the Crowdfunder's sheer damage output more than makes up for it. For reference, at its maximum fire rate, the Crowdfunder deals 2.5 times as much damage per second as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando|altText=Commando's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Double Tap}}, with 2.5 times the procs as well. 
*Since enemy level and gold drops increase considerably faster than player level (especially on higher [[difficulty]]), the Crowdfunder's consumption of gold is rarely an issue past the second stage, especially if the player has {{ItemLink|Ghor's Tome}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}} or a {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}.
** The Crowdfunder becomes self-sustaining while holding the {{ItemLink|Brittle Crown}}, but the player must not take damage and thus lose gold.
* Having the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} enabled can make the Crowdfunder more usable, since players will not need money to obtain most items.
* The Crowdfunder can be a great way to get multiple stacks of effects such as bleed.

}}

== Trivia ==
* While in use, the Crowdfunder makes the same sound as the slot machines (while spinning) in Ratchet and Clank 1-3, Size Matters and Secret Agent Clank.
* This item may be a reference to the [https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Coin_Gun Coin Gun] from Terraria, an extremely rare and powerful weapon that shoots the player's coins as bullets.
**It may also be a spiritual successor to the [[ror:Golden Gun|Golden Gun]] from the first Risk of Rain game, which was an uncommon item that boosted the holder's damage the more gold they had.
* The Crowdfunder is unlocked by collecting $30,480 gold, a reference to the amount pledged on Kickstarter for the first Risk of Rain game.

'''The Demons And The Crabs''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by killing 20 {{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab|Hermit Crabs}} by chasing them off the edge of the map.

==Tips==
* This challenge is cumulative across all runs. It ''does not'' have to be completed within a single run.
* An important aspect of this challenge is that Hermit Crabs spawn on only two stages; {{EntityLink|Abyssal Depths}} and '''post-loop''' {{EntityLink|Titanic Plains}}, and only the latter has edges to chase the Hermit Crabs off of.
** {{EntityLink|Artifact of Dissonance}} cannot be used, as it will make Hermit Crabs not spawn at all.
** Hermit crabs will also spawn in {{EntityLink|Titanic Plains}} during the [[Alternate Game Modes|Prismatic Trials]] so you can use this to easily complete the challenge without needing to do a full loop.
** Hermit Crabs within the [[Alternate Game Modes|Simulacrum]] count towards this challenge; If either of the aforementioned stages are chosen (Note that Abyssal Depths within the Simulcarum does have an edge), it is possible to chase crabs off the edge of the stage, though this highly depends on where the Assessment Focus is.
* It's recommended to find the [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] in {{EntityLink|Sky Meadow}} to use the [[Bazaar Between Time|Lunar Seer]] to guarantee Titanic Plains appearing.
* Using {{SurvivorLink|REX}} with {{SkillLink|DIRECTIVE: Disperse|REX}} is highly recommended in quickly completing this challenge, since it can push the Hermit Crabs off the cliffs without damaging and accidentally killing them.
* The {{ItemLink|Primordial Cube}} can be used to help drag Hermit Crabs off the edge of the stage, or bring them near.
* Avoid items such as {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}, {{ItemLink|Unstable Tesla Coil}}, {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} and offensive drones in order to not accidentally kill the Hermit Crabs.

'''The Lone Survivor''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by staying alive for 30 consecutive minutes.

==Tips==
* This can be achieved easily by completing the first stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]], defeating any remaining enemies, and then waiting on that stage until the timer reaches 30 minutes.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an alternate final stage [[Environments|Environment]] introduced in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. The Planetarium can be accessed by clearing all the [[Void Locus#Deep Void Signal|Deep Void Signals]] within the {{EntityLink|Void Locus}} and entering the Deep Void Portal, or alternatively by petting the [[Commencement#Glass Frog|glass frog]] on {{EntityLink|entityName=Commencement}} 10 times after defeating {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}}.

== Description ==
The Planetarium is an area somewhere within the Void, housing a collection of planets detained by the Void's denizens. It is inhabited primarily by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}}, the guard of the Planetarium or potentially the controller of the Void itself.

Planets orbit around a floating torus-shaped landscape, where the Voidling first makes their arrival. The area is initially made up of terrain native to the Void, but later moves to other landscapes resembling some environments of {{EntityLink|entityName=Petrichor V}}, those being {{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}}, and {{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}.

== Monsters ==

* {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} (Boss)
* Current [[The Planetarium#Simulated Environments|Simulated Environment's]] enemies (second and third phase) &lt;!-- Testing needed for specifics --&gt;

== Movement Gauntlets == 

Between phases of the boss fight, [[Survivors]] must advance through a void rift Voidling leaves behind and will have to navigate a gauntlet that tests their movement abilities.
&lt;gallery class="nobackground" mode="nolines" widths="320" heights="180"&gt;

File:Planetarium Gauntlet - Spinning Cubes.jpg|Spinning Cubes
File:Planetarium Gauntlet - Rising Platforms.jpg|Rising Platforms
File:Planetarium Gauntlet - Swaying Arches.jpg|Swaying Arches
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tips ===
* Mobility items such as {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather}}, {{ItemLink|Wax Quail}}, and {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}} will make the gauntlet easier to traverse.
** Likewise, {{SurvivorLink|Huntress|Huntress's}} {{SkillLink|Blink}} and {{SkillLink|Phase Blink}} skills, as well as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary|Mercenary's}} {{SkillLink|Cybernetic Enhancements|altText=passive}} and {{SurvivorLink|Heretic|Heretic's}} triple jump, along with [[Loader|Loader's]] Spiked Fist, Grapple Fist, Thunder Gauntlet, &amp; Charged Gauntlet.
**The damaging [[Void Fog]] requires players to move swiftly through the gauntlet. Movement speed items, including {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}} and {{ItemLink|Energy Drink}} will make the gauntlets easier.
** In contrast, {{ItemLink|Stone Flux Pauldron}} will make progression significantly more difficult (especially with multiple stacks).
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Eccentric Vase}} is also a viable option to beat the gauntlet(s).

== Simulated Environments ==

For the second and third phases of the boss fight, the arena changes to simulate a random [[Environments|Environment.]] The selected environment will affect which [[Monsters]] spawn during the fight, such as {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|altText=Stone Golems}} in Titanic Plains, and {{MonsterLink|Blind Vermin}} in Aphelian Sanctuary. No monsters will spawn in the first environment, which is always the Void itself.

File:Planetarium Arena - Sirens Call.jpg|Siren's Call
File:Planetarium Arena - Abyssal Depths.jpg|Abyssal Depths
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Logbook Entry==

The Environment Log for the Planetarium is located in the center of the first ring, floating in empty space. When collecting it, be aware of the Voidling - the Log is past the trigger to spawn the boss, and it will likely try to attack you as you move to retrieve the logbook. It will disappear after a period of time if not picked up.

== Version History ==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Survivors of the Void Update]]
*Added New Hidden Realm: The Planetarium
}}

== Trivia ==
* If Siren's Call is used for the second or third phases of the fight, it will feature the broken probes on the ground which blink the "updog" Morse code message similar to the original stage.
* The planets in the background are references to other media
** There are 5 planets that look like Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, and Neptune.
** There is a planet that appears like the Moon from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, albiet with a shadow over most of the face.
** A planet with many pastel colors may be a reference to the planet TOI 1338 b, often coined Wolftopia.
** Another planet with a mustache and long nose appears to be the Death Egg from Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
** The Halo Array from the Halo series also appears.

      <text bytes="2087" sha1="8vc4gn2fa4nayy8rgh7pfbjsrb885wt" xml:space="preserve">The followers of N’kuhana believe there is a balance to the world. Health and time. Pain and love. Death and memories. All in perfect synergy. As time went on, the balance of the world was destabilized. There were more births than there were people dying. With no volume for death in the world, N’kuhana could not visit her pupils. With the aid from the scriptures known as The N’tormat, her disciples spread her words and opinions. They will sow death to restore order to the world and be granted audience with her.

The belief of N'kuhana can be traced to other parts of the universe. One such instance can be traced back to a burial site on Venus. There was a ritual taking place that was supposedly interrupted by a boy who did not believe in the concepts of N'kuhana.

A group of survivors, some devotees, can be traced to the [[Wetland Aspect]]. Consisting of Marion, Hitchcock, Pugh, Larsen, Dillon, Carney, Stevens, and an unnamed member (devotee and the narrator of the [[Wetland Aspect]] log). Marion was in possession of the {{ItemLink|Ceremonial Dagger}}, a knife used to sacrifice believers and heretics alike as gifts for N’kuhana. 

At some point, the group was attacked by {{MonsterLink|Stone Golem|Stone Golems}}. In the golems' pursuit, Hitchcock was blown to pieces. Marion frantically begged the unnamed member to kill her with the dagger, claiming it was magical and would save the group. Reluctantly, they killed Marion. Pugh witnessed the murder, and his misunderstanding and subsequent noisy reaction risked the group's safety, leaving the killer with no choice but to kill him, too. 

That night, a member of the group, Carney, found a book on N'kuhana's teachings — likely the N'tormat or another text about Her Concepts. Inspired by the religious text and worried he might interfere, the killer murdered Carney and stashed his corpse in a hidden Altar to N'kuhana, where they worshipped Her Concepts. 

The exact timing is unclear, but the killer murdered the rest of the group sometime later in ritualistic sacrifice.

==Overview==
The timeline can be divided into 4 approximate segments: 

Pre-Betrayal - Before the point at which Providence trapped Mithrix on the moon.

Post-Betrayal - After the point at which Providence trapped Mithrix on the moon.

Before Present - Before the events of the game take place. Unknown if they happened before or after the Betrayal.

Present - During the events of Risk of Rain 1 and Risk of Rain 2.
==Pre-Betrayal==

*[[Mithrix]] and Providence (the brothers) somehow exist on [[Petrichor V]], be it born or not.
*The brothers chase glass frogs in the sun.
*Providence catches Mithrix tossing worms into a gravity well.

''- A few millennia pass from this point to the next -''

*The brothers create [[teleporter]]s, which they call "gates."
*Mithrix learns that he loves design, while Providence learns to create and shape.
*Mithrix builds [[Bulwark's Ambry]], as a place for Providence to create anything he wants using the 4 elements of the universe Mithrix found. In the Ambry, Providence creates the [[artifacts]].
*The brothers, as they reshape the planet to their liking, talk about [[Sundered Grove]]. Mithrix loves triangles, while Providence loves circles and rings. They both love trees, though.
*The brothers start to create [[Stone Golem|golems]], which they call "Guardians."
*[[Aurelionite]] is created, and Mithrix has to seal it away, as it is sentient and dangerous to him and Providence. This is because Providence added more soul than Aurelionite's design required, making it both powerful and unstable.
*Mithrix shows Providence how to create a golem with no soul, being the original design of the [[Lunar Chimera (Golem)|Lunar Chimera Golem]]. Later, Providence would adapt this design when creating the [[Ror:Temple Guard|Temple Guards]].
*Much time passed before "She" came. It is unknown who "She" is, but it is known that she is no female that is known in Risk of Rain.
*The brothers know that "She" is coming again soon, and Mithrix wants to show her some of the gates they've made.
*Mithrix creates the first and only teleporter that can travel between planets, which is known to be the [[Sky Meadow|Primordial Teleporter]]. He does this because he wants to find more of their own species and leave behind Petrichor V, which has doomed species on it.
*Providence, who cares for the beings on Petrichor V but knows his brother does not, allows Mithrix to go to the [[Commencement|moon]]. Once Mithrix is there, Providence locks the way back and traps Mithrix on the moon. We refer to this point as the Point of Betrayal.

==Post-Betrayal==

*Providence gathers monsters from other planets and brings them to Petrichor V.
*The [[Elder Lemurian]]s create the [[ror:Temple of the Elders|Temple of the Elders]] as thanks to Providence, whom they call their "Hero."
*The [[Imp]]s invade from the Red Plane, trying to retrieve an [[Imp Overlord|unknown artifact]], but become trapped on Petrichor V due to Providence's physical presence. Some of them attempt to overpower him, but fail.
*The ancestors of the [[Grovetender]]s create the [[Scorched Acres]] as thanks to Providence, who saved them from death. Providence does not seem to notice their efforts to honor him, so the generations of Grovetenders and their wisps endlessly tend to the Scorched Acres in hopes of repaying him someday.
*Creatures from the Void arrive at Petrichor V in an attempt to capture it, but are foiled various times by Providence, making it "the one planet they couldn't take".
*"She" had came and died, giving her blessing to Providence. What the blessing was is unknown, but her sacrifice is unknown to the inhabitants of the planet. Mithrix resents that Providence was given her gift.
*Mithrix begins creating [[Items#Lunar|lunar items]] with help from others on the moon. He scatters the items across Petrichor V, as any being that finds them is corrupted by his influence and becomes his servant.
*Mithrix tells his servants (primarily the [[Twisted Scavenger]]s) to go to the monolith in [[A Moment, Fractured]], and to activate it while holding his [[Beads of Fealty|beads]]. It sends them to [[A Moment, Whole]], a place where they can find peace, safe from the coming tidal wave of his vengeance.
*Providence, to try and stop his brother, hunts down any that find lunar items. Any and all such items he finds are thrown into [[Cleansing Pool]]s and turned into [[Irradiant Pearl|Pearls]], effectively destroying them.
*Mithrix designs and builds the [[Lunar Chimera (Wisp)|Lunar Chimera Wisp]] (inspired by the [[Greater Wisp]]s and [[Clay Templar]]s) and the [[Lunar Chimera (Exploder)|Lunar Chimera Exploder]].
*Mithrix details his plans for getting back at his brother who betrayed him, noticing Earth and planning on destroying it by building a Grander Teleporter to get there, all to see the look on Providence's face.

== Before Present ==

* The War of 2019 takes place, otherwise known as the War of Slopes. It is stated to be the bloodiest conflict in human history. Artifacts such as the [[Berzerker's Pauldron]] and [[War Horn]] are retrieved from the site of the battle.
* The High Court becomes the most technologically advanced society known to humankind, keeping their advancements a close secret. The House Beyond travels deeper into space than the rest of the Court.
* An [[Artificer]] of the High Court somehow is trapped by the [[Bazaar Between Time#Newt|Newt]] in the [[Bazaar Between Time]].
* [[Bundle of Fireworks|Fireworks]] are re-legalized for residential use in 2054, having been banned previously after terrorists disguised missiles as fireworks.
* The Followers of N'kuhana grow in popularity, a cult that is fully devoted to Her Concepts. [[ror:Ceremonial Dagger|In one particular instance]], a ritual sacrifice by them is stopped by a boy who attempted to save his sister. The [[Ceremonial Dagger|dagger]] they used ends up on the UES ''Contact Light''.

==Present==

* The UES ''Contact Light'' goes off its scheduled course to take a detour through an unknown star system. The detour was requested by an unknown individual, redacted from the blackbox data.
*On day 5 of their detour, the UES ''Contact Light'' discovers Petrichor V and begins studying the planet. Coordinates are marked, and xenoarchaeologists and [[engineer]]s are sent down to the surface.
* After exploring Petrichor V for roughly 35 minutes, the xenoarchaelogists and engineers discover a teleporter. Hoping to find a matching pair, they load the collected teleporter into the cargo bay. It is unknown how they brought it aboard.
* About 25 minutes after the teleporter is loaded, Providence arrives onboard through it, wreaking havoc aboard the ship and causing it to crash in the span of 4 hours. 
*At some point during those 4 hours, [[Heretic|Kur-skan the Heretic]] appears on the ship via a blue portal, rushing to the front to repair the ship so it can fly, so she would be able to escape. As she reaches the bridge, Providence appears behind her and kills her instantly.
* The ship spills its contents across the entire planet and into space around it, with some remaining in its cargo bays. Any survivors evacuate the ship via escape pods to the planet below. Only 56% of the escape pods are launched before Providence presumably kills the rest of the crew aboard.
* Of the pods that escaped the ship, one contains the [[Ror:Commando|Commando]] from the first game, also known as The Survivor. The rest of the pods contain the surviving crew of the Contact Light, who establish rallypoints for survival and reconnaissance such as [[Rallypoint Delta]].
* The Survivor, in the span of a few weeks, travels through the teleporters to reach the remains of the ''Contact Light.'' He documents his time on the planet via monster logs and some item logs, the items he found being classified as field-found. Along the way, he frees [[Acrid]] from its cage in the [[Ror:Sunken Tomb|Sunken Tomb]].
* The Survivor battles and kills Providence, and uses the still-functional components of the Contact Light to escape the planet. The Survivor is also the '''only''' '''survivor''' to escape. 
* With Providence dead, the creatures of the Void move to capture Petrichor V, causing in-fighting amongst monsters as some are controlled by [[Void Infestor]]s. 
* Two individuals are captured by void creatures at some point: Acrid is detained in the [[Void Fields]], and a lone [[Commando]] is trapped in the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] for endless training.
* The survivors Marion, Pugh, Larsen, Dillon, Carney, Stevens, and Hitchcock end up in the [[Wetland Aspect]]. Hitchcock is killed by Stone Golems. To escape the Golems, Marion gives the dagger she had in her backpack to an unnamed survivor, who kills her with it and manages to stop the Golems with its power. Carney later discovers a book in a chest nearby called the [[N'kuhana's Opinion|N'tormat]], which describes N'kuhana's cult. The unnamed survivor becomes corrupted by N'kuhana's influence and murders the other survivors, sacrificing Carney to the [[Wetland Aspect#Altar to N.27kuhana|altar]] they built in the cliffs below.
*The rest of the survivors die out over time, meeting grisly fates all across the planet. Acrid survives its imprisonment in the Void Fields, setting it up to return for the events of the second game. It is the only survivor to appear in both games. 
*The Commando that was captured by the void creatures, now corrupted into the [[Void Fiend]], escapes the Simulacrum.

- ''An unknown period of time later -''

* UES [Redacted] responds to the distress call of the ''Contact Light''. The ship is well-equipped, with units designed for exploration, science, hydroponics, and more.
* Members of the UES [R] go across the planet to explore, document monsters, environments, retrieve Security Chests of the Contact Light, and other things.
* Some scientists on UES [R] find the Artifact Teleporter on [[Sky Meadow]]s, leading to the Bulwark's Ambry, and successfully manage to connect to it using their technology.
* Other scientists [[Molten Perforator|dissect monster parts]], while exploration groups bring in [[Mired Urn|artifacts and materials]] from the planet to study.
* During their time around the planet, [[REX]] breaks protocol and becomes sentient. The head of the Hydroponics division tells the hydroponics team to terminate it due to the dangers it poses. They do so, and REX ends up in the [[Abyssal Depths]], out of fuel.
*It is entirely unknown whether the crew of the UES [R] went back to where they came, or died on the planet.

''- An unknown amount of time later -''

* UESC re-hires a famous retired [[Captain]], who worked on many secret projects for them before, for one last mission. He agrees, but is suspicious of the pretense of it being a "rescue mission," since he is assigned the UES ''Safe Travels'' (which is not a rescue ship). As a precaution, he requests that the ship be stocked with armaments and supplies.
* Various [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] are sought out and hired for the expedition, including bounty hunters such as [[Huntress]], and [[Commando]] who is reassigned from active duty.
* Before the UES ''Safe Travels'' takes off, the [[Bandit]] sneaks onboard, taking advantage of everyone wearing environment suits and being hired mercenaries.
*Hiroshi and Rico, maintenance crew and part of UESC, kill time by modifying a [[MUL-T]] unit inside of a hangar and enabling its learning module. They fail to call the MUL-T back to disable the learning module.
* The ''Safe Travels'' arrives in orbit of Petrichor V, getting the distress signal the ''Contact Light'' sent out during its crash. The signal details monsters attacking the ship. The Captain decides to send the crew down anyway, both in drop pods and drop ships.
* During the first 24 hours, major casualties are sustained, with many of the ships being crashed and destroyed. An unknown amount of survivors make their way through the teleporters on the planet, eventually reaching the moon.
*Once on the moon, the survivor(s) discover a rescue shuttle that has been captured by Mithrix and placed under a force field, with evidence of a struggle having taken place as a number of dead Commandos can be found around it.
*The survivor(s) battle and kill Mithrix, freeing the rescue shuttle. Just after Mithrix's death, Void Reavers begin invading the moon, attempting to capture it.
* The survivor(s) escape in the rescue shuttle, just before the Void Reavers pull the moon into the void.

The '''Titanic Knurl''' is a [[Items#Boss|boss item]] in Risk of Rain 2, dropped by the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Stone Titan}}.

The holder gains a flat +40 maximum HP (''+40 HP per stack''), and their natural health regeneration is increased by +1.6 HP/s (''+1.6 HP/s per stack''). Additionally, this regeneration bonus increases by 20% per player level, or 0.32 HP/s per level, per stack.

==Notes==
* The regeneration provided by the Titanic Knurl benefits from the {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}}.
* As with other healing items which increase [[Health#Health Regeneration|base health regeneration]], picking up a Titanic Knurl does ''not'' inhibit the completion of the [[Naturopath]] challenge.

==Trivia==
* The Titanic Knurl is the successor to the [[ror:Colossal Knurl|Colossal Knurl]] from Risk of Rain 1 item. The Colossal Knurl drops from the Stone Titan's predecessor, the [[Ror:Colossus|Colossus]], and increases the holder's health, health regeneration, and armor.
* During Early Access, prior to the introduction of the {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}, the Titanic Knurl would drop as a reward for defeating {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} in the [[Gilded Coast]].

The '''Titanic Plains''' are a vast, fractured, grassy plateau located on [[Petrichor V]], and one of the initial [[Environments]] encountered in ''Risk of Rain 2.''

Gigantic stone arches bracket the skyline, while the main play-field overlooks a vast fractured tectonic lowland.

There are currently two variants of Titanic Plains.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

Whenever the holder kills a monster, they gain 15 [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] ''(+15 barrier per stack)'', depleting at a rate of 3.33% of the player's max health per second. 

== Notes ==
* Barriers do not grant [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]], but also do not interact with HP-based one-shot protection.
* The maximum amount of barrier obtainable is equal to the player's maximum health plus their maximum shields.
* The {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} works somewhat well with this item, triggering the Topaz Brooch a total of 8 times per activation.
* Barrier depletes at a rate of 3.33% of the player's max health per second, but the Topaz Brooch grants a fixed amount of barrier per stack. 
** This means that Topaz Brooch gets worse the higher the player's maximum health is, and  it means that high stacks of Topaz Brooches are required to keep the barrier sustained late-game.
** As a result, the Topaz Brooch becomes generally outclassed by {{ItemLink|itemName=Aegis}} once the player has enough healing items to sustain it, especially since many healing items ''do'' scale with the player's health. However, high stacks of Topaz Brooch in the early to midgame can be very effective.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item grants a 15% (''+15% per stack'') chance of negating incoming damage.  If the roll is successful, the damage will be negated and a "Blocked!" message will appear instead of damage numbers.  

== Notes ==
* Self-inflicted damage from the {{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}}, [[Shrine of Blood|Shrines of Blood]], and {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX's}} "plant" skills can be blocked.
* When a hit is blocked successfully, on-hit effects will not trigger. These include but are not limited to the lightning bombs from [[Monsters#Overloading|Overloading Elite]]s, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleeding}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire}}, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Poisoned}}, and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Weak}}.
* The item will not block a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver}} death implosion, since the implosion does not actually deal damage. Similarly, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary|altText=Mercenary's}} invincibility on either of his utilities and his default special, and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Immune|altText=invulnerability}} in general, will not block the implosions either.
* Tougher Times is one of the few items in the game with [[Item Stacking#Hyperbolic Stacking|Hyperbolic Stacking]].
* The corrupted version of this item, released in the [[Survivors of the Void]] expansion, is [[Safer Spaces]].
* Tougher Times cannot block damage inflicted by the {{StatusEffectLink|VoidFog|Void Fog}} [[Status Effects#Debuffs|debuff]].

== Math ==
The chance to activate is determined by the formula: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \bigg(1 - \frac{1}{0.15x + 1} \bigg)
= \bigg( \frac{0.15x + 1}{0.15x + 1} - \frac{1}{0.15x + 1} \bigg)
= \frac{0.15x}{0.15x + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the amount.

The chance to block is ''not'' affected by {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}} or {{ItemLink|Purity}}.

* When a hit is blocked, a squeaky toy sound effect plays.
* Prior to the [[Survivors of the Void]] update, the [[Void Fog|suffocation damage]] from the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}} could be negated by this item.

The '''Transcendence''' is a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

It increases the holder's maximum health by 50% (''+25% per stack''), but replaces all but 1 of their health with [[Health#Shield|shields]], which regenerate over a period of 2 seconds after avoiding damage for 7 seconds. Any health gained afterwards, such as by leveling up or picking up health-increasing items, will also be increased and converted into shields.

== Notes ==
* The holder needs to avoid damage for 7 seconds before they can begin regaining shields. Mobility and dodging are crucial to using this item.
** {{ItemLink|Warped Echo}} immediately begins shield regen when hit. All damage is taken in one instance instead of how the item would normally work.
* Because shields cannot be healed outside of recharging naturally, healing items become redundant. 
** {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}} continues to store healing by using the new shield-based maximum health for all calculations.
** Obtaining an {{ItemLink|Aegis}} transforms all excess healing into [[Health#Barrier|barriers]].
***Percentage-based healing, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Bustling Fungus}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Foreign Fruit}}, will calculate their healing based on the holder's new maximum health of 1, making them effectively useless even with an Aegis.
** Conversely, in the event that the player has little to no healing, Transcendence can be a great help, providing a way to regain health more quickly.
* Taking [[Damage#Damage over Time|damage over time]] can delay the timer for the health regeneration until the effect wears off. Be especially sure to avoid damage from these sources.
* {{ItemLink|Infusion}} and {{ItemLink|Bison Steak}} benefit from Transcendence's health increase, but the {{ItemLink|itemName=Personal Shield Generator}} does ''not''. Keep this in mind when choosing how to further augment health.
* {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} will allow the player to have a chance to recharge shields in combat, and {{ItemLink|Old War Stealthkit|altText=Old War Stealthkits}} can help the user regain their shields out of danger by temporarily cloaking them.
* Obtaining 3 or more stacks of {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}, or a single stack of Strides of Heresy and a {{ItemLink|Hardlight Afterburner}}, makes {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} last long enough for the player to fully recharge their shields while invulnerable.
* Since fall damage calculation uses the player's health without accounting for shields or barriers, Transcendence effectively reduces all fall damage to 1 point.
** This makes Transcendence useful for [[Survivors]] who lack skills to avoid fall damage, namely {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}}, and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}}.
* This item should be avoided at all costs when using {{SurvivorLink|REX|altText=REX's}} "plant" skills that cost health ({{SkillLink|skillName=Seed Barrage|survivorName=REX}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Bramble Volley|survivorName=REX}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Tangling Growth|survivorName=REX}}). Transcendence completely dismantles these skills' internal synergy of damaging REX to attack and healing to recoup the costs, and as a result it is colloquially known as a run-killer for this Survivor.
* The {{ItemLink|Silence Between Two Strikes}} equipment does still apply the 50% shield effect if the survivor has Transcendence, though this effectively does nothing, as there is no real difference between 1 and 0.5 maximum health.
* A player holding Transcendence becomes functionally immune to the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=HealingDisabled|altText=healing disabled}} debuff of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]], as shield regeneration is not considered healing.
**However, they must still contend with Malachite monsters' greatly increased attack strength.
* Since Transcendence sets the holder's health regeneration to 0 if it was negative, the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic|Heretic's}} main downside is removed, preventing her from inevitably dying over time.
* Transcendence pairs very well with [[Plasma Shrimp]], as this item is only active while your shields are up, including shields from Transcendence or [[Personal Shield Generator]].

*When facing the statue of Providence and looking to the right, {{EnvironmentLink|Prime Meridian}} can be seen in the distance. This is an incomplete and approximate model as no more detail is required. The head of the statue, visible from the boss fight arena in Prime Meridian, also has a model in this environment, however, it cannot be seen due to the fog limiting the player's vision.

The '''Tri-Tip Dagger''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

On hit, it gives a 10% ''(+10% per stack)'' chance to inflict {{StatusEffectLink|Bleeding|altUrl=Damage#Damage over Time}} on the target (which is multiplied by the hit's [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]]), dealing a total of 240% damage across (3 x proc coefficient) seconds (20% per tick, 4 ticks per second).

== Notes ==
* Unlike most other damage-over-time debuffs, an existing stack of Bleed will have its duration extended when a new stack with a longer duration is inflicted (e.g. if a stack has 1 second remaining but a new 3-second stack is inflicted, the 1-second stack is refreshed to 3 seconds). This means Bleed can be stacked infinitely as long as it is continuously inflicted.
**However, hits with a low proc coefficient will inflict shorter-duration stacks of Bleed, meaning that even with 100% Bleed chance, the window to inflict the next Bleed stack to refresh existing ones is much narrower. 
* The Tri-Tip Dagger's chance to activate stacks linearly 10%. With 10 daggers, attacks with 1.0 proc chance will have a 100% chance to bleed.
* This item's Bleed effect is the same debuff as the Bleed inflicted by the {{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen}}; if both items are held, only one stack of Bleed can be inflicted per hit.

== Trivia ==
* The Tri-Tip Dagger is the successor to the [[ror:Rusty Knife|Rusty Knife]] from Risk of Rain 1, which has a virtually identical effect.
* This item is based on a real type of knife known as a tri-edge dagger or simply a tri-dagger, which features three spiraling blade edges that meet at the tip. This type of dagger causes more serious internal damage than a traditional blade and the triangular wound inflicted is more difficult to properly suture. This has resulted in some urban legends falsely claiming that due to the long suffering inflicted on a victim, the dagger's use is ruled a war crime.

{{EquipmentPage|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn (Consumed)}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the ''[[Survivors of the Void Update|Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

The Tricorn cannot be activated in most circumstances; it can only be used when the user is aiming at a [[Monsters#Bosses|boss monster]] that has an associated [[Items#Boss|boss item]], in which case a ghostly diamond-shaped reticle will appear over the monster in question. Activating the Trophy Hunter's Tricorn while this reticle is active will instantly kill that monster, and cause the corresponding [[Items#Boss|item]] to drop from the point where it dies. The Trophy Hunter's Tricorn is then "consumed," replacing the ghostly, incorporeal version of the hat with a standard-looking tricorn, and removing the floating blunderbuss entirely.  

Activating the consumed Tricorn will send the message "Ahoy!" in the chat, as if typed by the player using it. This ability has a cooldown of 60 seconds.

==Notes ==
* If used on the {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, it will drop {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}, the boss item normally reserved for the {{MonsterLink|Solus Control Unit}}. As the Worship Unit never shows up as a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]] in normal gameplay, and thus has no unique boss item of its own, it presumably borrows the Control Unit's item just so that the Worship Unit can also be targeted by the Tricorn.
* If used on {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} in the [[Gilded Coast]], then Aurelionite itself will drop a {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}, in addition to the guaranteed Halcyon Seed that normally drops near the gold portal.
** Aurelionite cannot be targeted while it is immune to damage.
** If you have [[Artifacts|Artifact of Chaos]] active it can also be used on a friendly {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} when it's summoned by a {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}} during a teleporter event. Doing so will kill the {{MonsterLink|Aurelionite}} but reward you with a {{ItemLink|Halcyon Seed}}.
* If used on a {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}} or {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}}, the {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator|Molten}}/{{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}} will drop where the worm's head is. Time the shot carefully so that the item does not end up in an inaccessible location or stuck underground.
* if the consumed version is given to an equipment drone, the drone will say "ahoy" in the chat when it uses it.

==Tips==
* Keep in mind that activating the Tricorn will put the equipment slot it occupies on a 60 second cooldown, despite its primary effect being single-use. This may cause a delay in usability if the player plans to swap to another equipment item promptly after using the Tricorn, or if the {{ArtifactLink|Enigma}} is enabled.
** Technically the Tricorn has a cooldown of 0 seconds and its consumed counterpart has 60 seconds. Upon activation, the transformation takes place before calculating the cooldown based from the current equipment. However, this makes the Tricorn, along with the {{ItemLink|Executive Card}}, ideal for refreshing all equipment charges in one go due to their extremely low cooldown.
* Although the additional equipment charges provided by holding one or more {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|Fuel Cells}} might ''appear'' to indicate that the Tricorn's boss-killing effect can be used several times in succession, the first successful use of a Tricorn ''always'' transforms the item into its consumed version. Any remaining charges afterwards will simply send "Ahoy!" instead.
** This also applies to {{ItemLink|Bottled Chaos}} activating the tricorn multiple times.
* Be wary of picking up {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}} while holding the Tricorn, or vice-versa, as it will cause the Tricorn to be immediately used on the first applicable boss that the player looks at. This may result in the dropped item being unobtainable if the boss in question is over a pit or some otherwise inaccessible terrain at the time, or may net the player a boss item that they are uninterested in.
* Since this item is single-use and cannot be activated at all under most circumstances, giving it to an {{EntityLink|Equipment Drone}} might be worth considering, as this can free up the player's personal equipment slot for something more useful in the long-term. However, this also means that the Equipment Drone will automatically use it to execute the first boss enemy it sees, so the aforementioned Gesture caveat also applies here.
** Since this drone inherits behaviours from {{EntityLink|Gunner Drone}} and will not fire until the owner is within 20m, it can be manipulated into not firing by keeping distance with the drone (or the boss in question as well), as the drone will only fire at an enemy when they are within 15m of it while simultaneously having their owner closer than 20m)
** Note that once an Equipment Drone has used the Tricorn's one-off boss-slaying effect, it will be replaced with the consumed version of the Tricorn, and the Drone will begin saying "Ahoy!" in the game chat about once every 12 seconds. While it will function as little more than a pirate-themed target for enemies to shoot at until it breaks, this does at least allow it to draw some fire away from any nearby players. An already-consumed Tricorn can also be given to an Equipment Drone, much to the same effect.
* The consumed Tricorn's "Ahoy!" has a hard second cooldown of two seconds. This cooldown can be reached with sufficient {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell|altText=Fuel Cells}} and Gesture of the Drowned.

==Trivia==
* This item's logbook entry is a reference to the short story "[[wikipedia:The Most Dangerous Game|The Most Dangerous Game]]".
* When held by {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}, the spectral blunderbuss that usually appears next to a player with the Trophy Hunter's Tricorn will appear to be both backwards and upside-down. It is unclear whether this is meant to reflect how the character in question is an animal with no knowledge of how guns work, or if the unusual placement is simply a developer oversight.
* Ahoy!

They collectively serve as the boss of {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}}, but only one randomly chosen Twisted Scavenger appears each time. There are 4 Twisted Scavengers, each sharing their skills with regular {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}}. However, each has their own preset list of [[items]] and [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] to spawn with, including one [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]]/[[Items#Lunar Equipment|equipment]].

Upon killing the Twisted Scavenger and opening its sack, it drops {{LunarCoin|10}}. After a while, the screen will black out, ending the run.

* 1 {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}

If the player lacks sufficient and consistent damage, it is possible to become soft-locked against Kipkip due to the healing synergy of its items, especially its {{ItemLink|Medkit|altText=Medkits}}.

== Wipwip the Wild ==
{{MonsterPage|Wipwip the Wild}}
Wipwip has the following items:
* {{ItemLink|Disposable Missile Launcher}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Focus Crystal}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine}}
* 2 {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}
* 2 {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Brilliant Behemoth}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}

Wipwip also boasts unique stats compared to the other Twisted Scavengers, having reduced damage and vastly increased health to compensate for his {{ItemLink|Shaped Glass}}. Since the Thqwibs activate on-kill effect, the player should be extremely careful of the attack as the area-of-effect of Will-o'-the-wisp and Brilliant Behemoth can be devastating even if the original attack has been evaded.

{{Clear}}

== Twiptwip the Devotee ==
{{MonsterPage|Twiptwip the Devotee}}
Twiptwip has the following items:
* {{ItemLink|Glowing Meteorite}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Crowbar}}
* 2 {{ItemLink|Gasoline}}
* 2 {{ItemLink|Fuel Cell}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Soulbound Catalyst}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Transcendence}}
Similar to Wipwip the Wild players should be very cautious of Thqwibs because of Gasoline. The additional synergy of Soulbound Catalyst and Fuel Cells means Twiptwip will be able to activate its equipment fairly regularly.

There is a bug experienced that stops players from getting their Lunar Coins involving the Glowing Meteorite; more needs to be looked into.

{{Clear}}

== Guragura the Lucky ==
{{MonsterPage|Guragura the Lucky}}
Guragura has the following items:
* {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Soldier's Syringe}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}
* 3 {{ItemLink|Paul's Goat Hoof}}
* 2 {{ItemLink|Ukulele}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Kjaro's Band}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Runald's Band}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Shattering Justice}}
* 1 {{ItemLink|Visions of Heresy}}
Since its shotgun attack has a proc coefficient of 2.0, players should be extremely careful of getting hit by it, as the Tri-Tip Dagger stacks in conjunction with the 57 Leaf Clover means there is an 84% chance of being inflicted with {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleed}}, which will also last twice the normal duration.

Getting hit directly by Thqwibs is sufficient to proc the bands.{{Clear}}

== Notes ==

* Since the equipment held by all Twisted Scavengers can be dangerous, especially {{ItemLink|itemName=Disposable Missile Launcher}}, players should stay at least 80m away when their health has dropped below 75% health to prevent the equipment from being activated.

== Trivia ==
* The Twisted Scavengers do not have a Logbook Entry.
** The logbook for {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole}} however directly references them and effectivly serves as their lore entry. 
** Curiously, this trait of a creature's lore being in its related enviorment log is very similar to {{EntityLink|entityName=Newt}}.
* The code for{{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} is found on the forehead of each of the twisted scavangers.
* Killing the Twisted Scavenger without triggering the boss fight will generate its lunar coin sack on top of the player's location as if it had gone out of bounds
* When using the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}}, 2 Twisted Scavengers will spawn. They will not necessarily be the same Twisted Scavenger.
* Killing a Twisted Scavenger does not complete the challenge [[Acrid: Bad Medicine]].
* The screen will only start fading when no monsters are left on the stage, meaning that leftover {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|Beetle Guards}} spawned by Kipkip the Gentle may prevent the run from ending until killed.
* Twisted Scavengers were servants for the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss}}, staying safe in a {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Whole|realm}} untouched by his forthcoming destruction.&lt;ref&gt; https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/A_Moment,_Whole#Lore &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UES ''Safe Travels''''' is a spacefaring vessel in Risk of Rain 2, commanded by the {{SurvivorLink|Captain}}.

== Description ==
Some time after the events of [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]], the ''Safe Travels'' arrived in orbit of [[Petrichor V]] on a rescue mission to determine what became of the UES ''Contact Light'', locate any surviving crew, and salvage its valuable cargo. Given the diverse personnel on board, who make up the majority of the game's [[Survivors]], it remains a possibility that the rescue mission is only one part of the ''Safe Travels''' reason for traveling to the hostile world. 

Various downed rescue craft, ostensibly originating from the ''Safe Travels'', can be found throughout the game's [[Environments]], apparently recent given the wrecks' still-smoldering state. An ill-fated expedition to the planet's moon [[Commencement]] serves as the Survivors' means of escape at the game's conclusion via the still-functioning dropship initially detained on the moon's surface.

Despite its occupants starting the game by arriving from within an [[Escape Pod]], the UES ''Safe Travels'' appears to be functional, as the Captain is able to call for support planetside with his various abilities. Given the fate of [[ror:Providence|the one]] behind the ''Contact Light'''s crash, the orbit of Petrichor V is apparently safe.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Ukulele|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder hits an enemy, there is a 25% chance to create arcing chain lightning that hits up to 3 ''(+2 per stack)'' other targets within a 20m ''(+2m per stack)'' radius, dealing 80% [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|total damage]] to each with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.2. This chance to trigger is multiplied by the hit's proc coefficient.

== Tips ==
*If you're damaging an enemy while there are 3 other enemies nearby and you have a single Ukelele, your total DPS is increased by 60%. This makes Ukulele one of the best crowd-control items.
*Ukulele's Proc Coefficient of 0.2 sounds minor at first, but it's actually one of the strongest parts of the item. Having a proc coefficient means that it can trigger many other items, such as {{ItemLink|Tri-Tip Dagger}}, {{ItemLink|Chronobauble}}, {{ItemLink|Sticky Bomb}}, and {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}.
**The synergy between {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} and Ukulele is extremely powerful, as they can both trigger each other, creating what's called a "proc chain". The Ukelele's lightning can trigger missles, dealing free bonus damage to nearby enemies. Even better, the Missles can trigger Ukelele, and the lighting spawned from the Ukelele will deal 80% of the missle's damage, which can be extremely devastating. When combined with multiple {{ItemLink|57 Leaf Clover}}'s, just a few shots can devastate entire waves of enemies.
**{{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}} and {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}} both work nearly identically to {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, and equally benefit when combined with Ukelele.
***Having any combination of Ukelele, {{ItemLink|Molten Perforator}}, {{ItemLink|Charged Perforator}}, and {{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}} will let them proc off of each other leading to extended proc chains that deal a significant amount of damage.

== Trivia ==

* This item is iconic within ''Risk of Rain'' media; {{SurvivorLink|Commando}} is often depicted with a Ukulele in artwork for both ''Risk of Rain'' games, and it is referenced in the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|final boss's}} theme, which is titled "You're Gonna Need a Bigger Ukulele."

Many [[items]] in the game's files '''''cannot''''' be obtained from [[Chests]], [[Lunar Pod]]s, [[Teleporter]] drops, or any other natural means and must be cheated into existence either via [[modding]] or console commands. They can be of two categories:

*Internal items, which are actively used by the game to dictate certain behaviors for the holder, e.g., [[BoostDamage]].
*Unreleased items, which are either complete or (more likely) incomplete concepts that were not meant to be.

Most of these items lack proper world models, inventory icons, names, and descriptions, as they are either incomplete or, as in the case of internal items, unncessary. The majority of them feature generic data and the missing icon texture. For example, BoostDamage has "ITEM_BOOSTDAMAGE_NAME" and "ITEM_BOOSTDAMAGE_DESC". As such, it is more convenient to refer to them by their internal names.

==Items==
'''ALL''' of the following items are treated as 'untiered items' when on the ground or in a character's inventory (similar to a {{ItemLink|itemName=Tonic Affliction}} or a {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend (Consumed)}}), meaning they cannot be [[Scrapper|scrapped]] or used in [[3D Printers]] or [[Cleansing Pool]]s. 

Items that are used for internal mechanics cannot be stolen by {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=Mithrix's}} 4th phase. This, however, does not apply for unreleased items that were meant to be used by the player. 

Items with no icon do not appear on the player's inventory, even if they have the missing icon model as a world pickup.

|Upon taking damage, gain '''30''' ''(+30 per stack)'' armor per 1% of total max HP dealt. The adaptive armor increase caps at 400 and decays at a rate of 40 armor per second.

This item is used for the [[Armor#Adaptive Armor|Adaptive Armor]] behavior used by {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} and {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}. Both bosses spawn with 1 stack of the item.
|-

|Increases health by '''10%''' ''(+10% per stack)''.

Used by entities that have increased health compared to their base spawns, e.g., Elite monsters.
|-
| [[File:Helfire Tincture.png|50px]]
|BurnNearby
|{{ItemLink|Helfire Tincture}} in item form, not as an equipment. It probably is an earlier implementation of the equipment behavior, whereby activating the equipment would give the player the item to trigger the effect and then take it away upon expiration.
|-
|[none]
|ConvertCritChanceToCritDamage
|Converts all critical strike chance to critical strike damage.

Used by {{SurvivorLink|Railgunner}}.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|CooldownOnCrit
|This item is identical to the [[ror:Wicked Ring|Wicked Ring]] from the first ''Risk of Rain''. It gives the holder +5% critical strike chance, and all their skill cooldowns are reduced by 1 second (''+1 per stack'') whenever they land a critical strike.
|-
|[[File:Effigy of Grief.png|50px]]
|CrippleWardOnLevel
|This item shares the same model and icon as the {{ItemLink|Effigy of Grief}}. It spawns an Effigy of Grief obelisk when the enemy team levels up.
|-
|[[File:Corpsebloom.png|50px]]
|CritHeal
|Gives +5% critical strike chance. Divides critical strike chance by n+1, where n is the number of stacks held, and turns it into "critical healing" chance, which is a chance for any healing received to be doubled.

This item was an early version of the {{ItemLink|Corpsebloom}}.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|CutHp
|Decreases max health by '''50%''' ''(-50% per stack)''. Stacks exponentially.

Used by minions and enemies when the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active. 
|-
|[none]
|[[DrizzlePlayerHelper]]
| This item gives the {{EntityLink|entityName=Drizzle}} difficulty modifiers to the holder, giving them increased [[armor]] and multiplying their base health regeneration by 1.5. The armor bonus stacks, giving +70 armor per stack.
|-
|[none]
| DroneWeaponsBoost
| This item gives '''50%''' ''(+50% per stack)'' attack speed, decreases skill cooldowns by '''50%''' ''(+50% per stack)'' exponentially, and gives '''10%''' chance to proc a missile on hit.

Used by allied drones while holding {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}}.
|-
|[none]
|DroneWeaponsDisplay1
| This item adds a machine gun model to allied drones while the owner holds {{ItemLink|Spare Drone Parts}} and it is responsible for the drones' machine gun attack.
|-
|[none]
|DroneWeaponsDisplay2
|This item functions exactly like ''DroneWeaponsDisplay1'' except that the model is a pistol. This model has only 10% chance of being chosen.
|-
|[[File:Egocentrism.png|50px]]
|EmpowerAlways
|This item has the same icon and model as {{ItemLink|Egocentrism}}, but appears to do nothing else.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|Ghost
|This item makes the holder appear invisible, but does not apply the invisibility buff (meaning that enemies will still target and attack them).

Used by {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}} ghosts.
|-
|[none]
|GummyCloneIdentifier
|This item adds the word "Gummy" to the entity's naming display.

Used by {{ItemLink|Goobo Jr.|gummy clones}}.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]] 
|HealthDecay
|The holder's health decreases over time, at a rate of &lt;code&gt;maxHP / stacks&lt;/code&gt; per second. One stack kills the holder in 1 second, 100 stacks kills in 100 seconds, etc.

Used by entities with temporary lifespan, e.g., Squid Polyp turrets, Happiest Mask ghosts, and [[Void Infestor]]s. If such entities have access to healing, they can survive for longer. Note that gummy clones and the {{SurvivorLink|Heretic}} use different methods to expire and lose health respectively.
|-
|[[File:Ancestral Incubator.png|50px]]
|[[Ancestral Incubator|Incubator]]
|This item was intended to be dropped as the original {{MonsterLink|Grandparent}} [[Items#Boss|boss item]], but is now unused. It is one of the few complete but unimplemented items.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|InvadingDoppelganger
|This item gives the holder '''1000%''' health, '''4%''' base damage, applies the purple screen filter that occurs when an Umbra is present, and gives the holder black and purple tentacle effects.

Used by the Umbras spawned by the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}}.
|-
|[none]
|LemurianHarness
|Gives a cosmetic vest to the holder.

Used by the Lemurians and Elder Lemurians by the {{ArtifactLink|Devotion}}.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|LevelBonus
|'''+1 experience level''' ''(+1 per stack)'' to the holder.
|-
| [[File:LunarWingsIcon.png|50px]]
|LunarWings
|Item from the [[Survivors of the Void]] DLC with a defined model, name, and lore, but lacking any behavior in the game's code.
|-
|[none] 
|MageAttunement
|Appears to do nothing. There is some unfinished code which implicates a scrapped concept for {{SurvivorLink|Artificer}}, whose internal name is "Mage". According to it, depending on which items and equipment would be held, an element among Fire, Ice, and Lightning would be awarded.
|-
|[none]
|MinHealthPercentage
|Modifies the incoming damage according to &lt;code&gt;max(0, min(damage, combinedHealth - fullCombinedHealth * stacks / 100))&lt;/code&gt;, where ''combinedHealth = health + shields + barrier'' and '' fullCombinedHealth = fullHealth + fullShields''. Effectively it clips the incoming damage so that a holder with X stacks would not have their health reduced lower than X% of their max health.
Used by a scrapped version of the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Voidling}} final boss where it would initially start the fight with 66 stacks, then drop to 33, then 5, and finally 0 stacks.
|-
|[none]
|MinionLeash
|Implements the minion behavior so that an entity follows its owner or teleports near when too far away.

Used by allied minions.
|-
|[none]
|MonsoonPlayerHelper
| This item gives the {{EntityLink|entityName=Monsoon}} difficulty modifier to the holder, multiplying their health regeneration by 0.6. This effect does not stack.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|PlantOnHit
|Appears to do nothing. The {{ItemLink|itemName=Interstellar Desk Plant}} is internally referred to as "Plant," so this item might have originally been intended to spawn healing auras on hit.
|-
|[[File:Iconpng.png|50px]]
|PlasmaCore
|Appears to do nothing.
|-
|[[File:VoidScrapGreenIcon.png|50px]]
|ScrapGreenSuppressed
| A scrapped concept for a void scrapper which could be interacted with up to 3 times to remove a random white, green, and then red item from the run. Any such items already in the player's inventory would automatically transform into strange scrap.
|-
|[[File:VoidScrapRedIcon.png|50px]]
|ScrapRedSuppressed
|See ''ScrapGreenSuppressed''.
|-
|[[File:VoidScrapWhiteIcon.png|50px]]
|ScrapWhiteSuppressed
|See ''ScrapGreenSuppressed''.
|-
|[[File:TexBanditCoinIcon.png|50px]]
|SkullCounter
|Appears to do nothing. Likely used as an early way to track {{SkillLink|skillName=Desperado|survivorName=Bandit}} kills.
|-
| [none]
|SummonedEcho
|The holder periodically spawns small black orbs with blue fire radiating off of them. These orbs track enemies with a harmless blue laser, and periodically fly in a straight line and stops to retarget. On contact with any surface or enemy, they will explode, dealing '''260%''' damage to enemies in a tiny radius. The holder gets increased movement speed, but their maximum health is reduced to 10%.
This item does not stack and is used by clones spawned by the unused Echo Elite.
|-
|[none]
|TeamSizeDamageBonus
|The item multiplies the holder's damage by &lt;code&gt;teamSize * stacks&lt;/code&gt;.

Used by the probes spawned by the {{ItemLink|Empathy Cores}}. Each probe spawns with 1 stack of the item. 
|-
|[none]
|TeleportWhenOob
|The holder of this item is teleported back when reaching out-of-bounds areas. Players and Umbras already do that, so this is meant for entities that do not satisfy either criterion and are also not supposed to die by going out of bounds.

Used by Mithrix in the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] boss wave.
|-

|TempestOnKill
| 25% chance on kill to create a Tempest Ward which lasts '''8''' seconds ''(+6 per stack)'' on the ground at the killed enemy’s location. Tempest Wards continually grant all allies within 5 meters '''+100%''' attack speed for 2 seconds.

There is an unused buff icon texture for this item. However, this item is currently broken and gives the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixPoison}} Elite buff instead due to internal buff ID changes.

| UseAmbientLevel
|Sets the holder's level equal to the ambient level.

Used by monsters and minions.

|[none]
|VoidmanPassiveItem
|Appears to do nothing. This item is automatically granted to the {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}}, similar to how the Railgunner gets the ''ConvertCritChanceToCritDamage'' and alludes to a scrapped idea for a Survivor passive ability. It is possible this item was intended to grand the Void Corruption ability, but this has been implemented in a different way instead. This item appears -but is never used- in the method that calculates the character's stats, so it may have been intended to grant a buff of some sorts.

|[[File:Berzerker's Pauldron.png|50px]]
|WarCryOnCombat 
|Upon entering combat, the player gains an aura that applies {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=WarCryBuff|altText=War Cry}} for '''6''' seconds ''(+4 per stack) to all allies within '''12''' meters ''(+4 per stack)''. Recharges after 30 seconds.''

This item shares the same model and icon as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Berzerker's Pauldron}}. It is most likely an earlier concept of said item, whose internal name is "WarCryOnMultiKill". Gorag's Opus also shares a similar buff, whose internal name is "TeamWarCry".

A few items have explicit names, descriptions, and lore entries.

'''CooldownOnCrit''':
* Name: Wicked Ring
* Pickup: 'Critical Strikes' reduce cooldowns by 1 second.
*Description: Gain 5% critical chance. Critical strikes reduces all your cooldowns by 1.

'''Incubator''':
* Name: Ancestral Incubator
*Pickup: Chance on kill to summon an Ancestral Pod.
*Description: 7% chance (+1% per stack) on kill to summon an Ancestral Pod that distracts enemies. Once it fully grows, it will hatch into an allied Parent with 100% health (+100% per stack).
*Lore: "How do they know who their leader is? Is it instinct? Or is there something about me? "I can't believe you're having me cover for you, Ashley. You know the rules. The last time someone brought something 'friendly' to the camp it did NOT end well. Rich cried for days." "But if we figure out how to communicate we can use it to our benefit! Besides, the guy is pretty helpful around here. He can lift heavy boxes and reach high places." "I think we should just put that thing back where you found it. Who knows if it will attract more?" "This is for science...! And besides, maybe it can teach us something about this environment. He's a native here." "Yeah, cool, native, okay, I'm out."

'''LunarWings''': 
*Name: Blessings of Terafirmae
*Pickup: PLACEHOLDER PICKUP DESCRIPTION
*Description: PLACEHOLDER DESCRIPTION
*Lore: A relic from an ancient avian race:  It is said that they gave up the gift of flight in order to establish new agricultural civilizations, bolstering their strength and numbers to withstand the ever-changing climate of their dying planet.

'''ScrapGreenSuppressed''':
* Name: Strange Scrap, Green
*Pickup: Does nothing. Prioritized when used with 3D Printers.
*Description: Does nothing. Prioritized when used with 3D Printers.
*Lore: The difference between "low" and "high" explosives is the rate of decomposition. The former is subsonic; the latter is supersonic. Our patented new material technically falls into the category of "high explosive", but thanks to breakthroughs in quantum entanglement, its rate of decomposition is not just supersonic--it's superluminal. Antimatter seemed promising at first, but this might actually be the innovation that makes planetary demolition economically viable. --Promotional Material for ExMat-7

'''ScrapRedSuppressed''':
*Name: Strange Scrap, Red
* Pickup: Does nothing. Prioritized when used with 3D Printers.
*Description: Does nothing. Prioritized when used with 3D Printers.
*Lore: "I think that they're alive. I should probably wait for the Science Team, but I don't think gently nudging one with a long stick is going to kill me." --Final message, bloodied recorder

'''ScrapWhiteSuppressed''':
* Name: Strange Scrap, White
*Pickup: Does nothing. Prioritized when used with 3D Printers.
* Description: Does nothing. Prioritized when used with 3D Printers.
*Lore: This statue appears to be made of pure silver according to every conceivable test except one: density. While this may seem to be an interesting puzzle, it's insidiously resistant to explanation. Those attempting to solve the riddle have unfortunately suffered subtle but persistent psychological harm. From the smirk of this silver monkey, you might conclude that this is its deliberate purpose.

'''SkullCounter''':
*Name: Skull Token
*Pickup: Proof of a specific kind of kill. Has no direct effect of its own.
*Description: Proof of a specific kind of kill. Has no direct effect of its own.

There is also one item that only appears in the language files and it may have been an early concept of what eventually became the {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}}:
*Name: Gold Flask
*Pickup: Gain a massive barrier at low health. Consumed on use.
* Description: Gain a temporary barrier for 100% of your health when falling below 30% health.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Tesla Coil|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item switches itself on and off every 10 seconds. While it is active, the holder gets the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=TeslaField}} buff, which makes them fire up to 3 (''+2 per stack'') lightning bolts at enemies every 0.5 seconds in a 35m radius. Each lightning bolt ignores terrain and deals 200% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 0.3.

== Notes==
*{{Color|note|Correction}}: The {{PAGENAME}} does not fire once every 0.5 seconds, but every 1/12th of a second and this lightning bolt can bounce up to 3 (''+2 per stack'') targets. These targets are collected in a blacklist so they are not hit again, which gets cleared every 0.5 seconds. So in theory one stack can hit up to 18 unique targets within half a second (6 targets originating from the player x 3 bounces for each of these bolts).

==Tips==
*This item is most effective on melee [[Survivors]] who stay close to enemies, such as {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}.
* Monsters that are equipped with the Unstable Tesla Coil are ''exceedingly'' dangerous and will swiftly kill any players that are even a moderate distance away. A monster could get an Unstable Tesla Coil if: 
** The player reaches the final cell in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}.
**The {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}} is enabled.
**The {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} is enabled, and an [[Artifacts#Vengeance|Umbra]] of a player holding a Tesla Coil spawns.
**Every 50th wave in the [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]]
**The monster is a {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger}}, and either spawns with or finds a Tesla Coil.
***If a Scavenger does have an Unstable Tesla Coil, it will appear on the left side of the Scavenger's forehead. Always check to see if it's there before approaching, especially as a melee [[Survivors|Survivor]] like {{SurvivorLink|Loader}}.
**{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix}} steals it from the player.
**The monster has a {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}} and kills a player holding a Tesla Coil.

{{ItemPage|Unstable Transmitter (Consumed)}}
The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

Falling below 25% health gives the holder 60% of their maximum health as barrier while gaining {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}} for 0.2 seconds. The player is also granted a 6m radius aura which lasts for 8 seconds. Any enemy that gets within this aura is teleported away, is inflicted with 3 stacks of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Bleed}}, and is stunned for 1 second. Such teleported enemies are marked for 8 seconds and if they are killed during this period by the player who teleported them, they extend the player's teleporting aura duration by 1 second, without exceeding a maximum duration of 10 seconds. After the aura ends, the item is disabled, and recharges at the beginning of every stage. Gaining more stacks of the item allows more uses but there is a 1.1 second cooldown between activations. 

==Notes ==   
*When an enemy is teleported away, the game prioritises locations approximately 40m in front of the player. If there are no such valid locations, then it is possible for the enemy to teleported to the side or even behind the player. If there is a wall in front of the player and a valid location behind it 40m away, then the enemy can be teleported there.
*When falling below 25% health, the Unstable Transmitter's effect has priority triggering, followed by the {{ItemLink|Power Elixir}}'s. Only when the Unstable Transmitter is on cooldown and all Power Elixirs are used will the {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch}}'s effect trigger.

==Tips==
*The player can choose which enemies to teleport away and which to continue engaging in combat in an attempt to divide and conquer. 
**Choosing to teleport away enemies that are near death can be a way to ensure they die after teleporting in order to extend the aura's duration. Since in most cases the enemy will be teleported in the player's vision it can be trivial for ranged survivors to keep targeting them in order to kill them.
*Taking advantage of knowing where the enemies are most likely to be teleported, the player can choose to approach an enemy from a certain angle so that they can be teleported near other enemies in order to take advantage of any on-kill effects. 
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Shatterspleen}} can be very useful here due to the effect inflicting bleed on enemies.
*While it may be impractical for melee characters to engage enemies while the aura is active,  {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} has the unique interaction that their grapple hook will stay attached to the teleported enemy, thus continuously pulling Loader or the enemy into each other, which can result into triggering the effect multiple times and building up the bleed stacks.
*{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer}} can greatly benefit from this item due to increasing the survivability of its turrets, similar to {{ItemLink|itemName=Power Elixir}}. Teleporting enemies away that try to swarm them will also give them some breathing room.

{{VersionHistory|
;[[Patch v1.3.8]]
*Other Changes
**{{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} now grants 60% [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] on activation (up from 35%). It has also had its internal cooldown changed from 45 seconds to 1.1 seconds, for those of you that choose to hoard several Transmitters at a time.
*Bug Fixes
**Players will no longer retain a charge of {{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} if revived after being killed during the active-effect.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.7]]
*Item Changes
**{{ItemLink|Unstable Transmitter}} can now only be activated once per stage and barrier gain has been reduced to 35% of maximum health (was 75%.) Item regenerates at the start of each stage. [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|One Shot Protection]] removed.
----
;[[Patch v1.3.6]]
* Reworked Unstable Transmitter
** Old Functionality - When reaching below 25% health the Survivor explodes, dealing 350% (+350% per item stack) damage to nearby enemies and teleporting to a random location. This effect has a cooldown of 2 minutes (-5% per item stack).
** Updated Functionality - Falling below 25% health gives you 75% of your maximum health as a temporary barrier. Gain a dimensional aura for 8s that bleeds and teleports away enemies. Enemies killed by the aura extend the duration by 1s. Recharges every 45s (-10% per stack.)

;[[Seekers of the Storm]]

* Added New Item: Unstable Transmitter

The '''Verdant Falls''' are an overgrown, shimmering ruin added in the [[Devotion Update]], located on [[Petrichor V]] and is found in the first set of [[Environments]] in ''Risk of Rain 2''.

A large, thorned flower with water flowing from atop its petals bursts through the ruins of a crash site.

[[Viscous Falls]] is a variant of this environment.

}}

==Trivia==
*A guaranteed Large Chest or Scrapper can be found at the top of the crushed ship.
*This is the only environment in all of stages 1-5 where a [[Chests#Cloaked Chest|Cloaked Chest]] does not spawn, as well as any [[Survivors of the Void|Survivor of the Void]] interactables, including [[Void Seed]]s.
**However, it does feature Geep and Gip.
*Verdant Falls is also one of the very few stages where the [[Monsters#Bosses|Teleporter Bosses]] do not have an equal chance of spawning. The weights are 3:2:1 for {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Stone Titan}}, {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Beetle Queen}}, and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Wandering Vagrant}} respectively.
*If the [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] is not in the divot in the wall, that area will be covered with a section of wall. Pinging this section will instead ping the location of the [[Newt Altars|Newt Altar]] that has spawned. This is most likely a bug.
* The Garret and Kelvin in this story seem to be the same ones from {{SurvivorLink|CHEF|CHEF's}} lore page.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Items#Lunar|lunar item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Hidden Realms Content Update|Hidden Realms Update]]'' and a part of the [[Heretic|Heresy Set]].

Obtaining the Visions of Heresy will replace the [[Survivors|Survivor's]] primary attack (M1 by default) with the Hungering Gaze skill.
__TOC__
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;{{SkillType|Primary|
{{Skill
| name     = Hungering Gaze
| type     = Primary
| cooldown = 2s {{Stack|(+2s per stack)}} since the last shot was fired
| proc     = Initial hit: 0.1&lt;br&gt;Explosion: 1.0
| notes    = 
* The initial hit deals 5% base damage.
* Once the cooldown period is finished, all stacks are recharged at once.
* Each shot will reset the cooldown period back to the full 2 seconds.
* Changes the firing of {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets.
* Replaces both of {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T|MUL-T's}} selected primary skills. However, it does not replace the second primary while in {{Color|mul-t|Power Mode}}.
* Picking up an Ammo Box from a {{ItemLink|Bandolier}} will grant the full capacity.
* Getting a {{ItemLink|Purity}} will allow the player to only have a 0.5 second cooldown between shots.
* Takes about 1.29 seconds to fire 12 shots, and 3.29 seconds including the cooldown.
}}
}}&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Synergies ==
* On very long runs, this item can be useful for {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Acrid}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}}, since enemies will be so powerful that being in melee range is dangerous. However, on a normal-length run, the Visions of Heresy are a downgrade for these Survivors.
** Hungering Gaze also removes Loader's main way to activate her {{SkillLink|skillName=Scrap Barrier|survivorName=}} passive. Gather other items to make up for the lost survivability.
* On Survivors with primary attacks that have high fire rates and/or many projectiles, such as {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Commando}}, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}}, Hungering Gaze is a direct downgrade due to its recharge cooldown.
* On {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}}, replacing her primary with Hungering Gaze is generally better when holding a lot of on-hit items, such as{{ItemLink|AtG Missile Mk. 1}}, and more of a toss-up when holding none. 
** The only case when replacing Artificer's primary could be detrimental is when the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=OnFire}} from {{SkillLink|skillName=Flame Bolt|survivorName=Artificer}} is contributing to a {{ItemLink|Death Mark}}, or is being boosted by {{ItemLink|Ignition Tank}}.
*As with most items, Visions of Heresy will affect {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} turret&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as well as himself. This means that Engineer can use Hungering Gaze instead of the clunky {{SkillLink|skillName=Bouncing Grenades}}, and his turrets will also gain Hungering Gaze. This increases Engineer's damage output as well as his turrets', making it an all-around excellent choice.
*Because Hungering Gaze has a cooldown, attack speed items a&lt;nowiki/&gt;re reduced in effectiveness. Bonus attack speed does increase the rate at which the 12 bullets are fired, but will not modify the cooldown at all, resulting in a lower expected increase in damage output. 
**Cooldown reduction items such as the {{ItemLink|itemName=Bandolier}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Brainstalks}} can help mit&lt;nowiki/&gt;igate this downside.

== Notes ==
* The delayed explosions can trigger on-hit items independently of the initial hits.
* This item has a special interaction with the {{MonsterLink|Mithrix|altText=final boss}}.
* Obtaining this item along with the other three Heresy items will turn the holder into the {{EntityLink|entityName=Heretic}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monster family.

== Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

Like other {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies, Void Barnacles can spawn on any map if spawned in a [[Void Seed]].

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Void Barnacles behave very similarly to {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Alpha Construct|altText=Alpha Constructs}}, emerging out of any terrain, including walls and ceilings, where they will remain as immobile turret-like creatures.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Void Barnacle's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks.

===Primary: Ink Shot===
The Void Barnacle shrinks itself for 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) before firing an ink-like projectile that moves at 30m/s and homes in on its target. Upon impact or after 3 seconds, it explodes dealing 300% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 2m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]]. This attack has an end lag of 1.2 seconds which also scales with attack speed 

{{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can block this projectile. 

This skill has no cooldown and its firing rate is only limited by charging and end lag delays. 

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use primary''': the Void Barnacle must be within 80m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 1 second and the skill is not necessary to be off cooldown, but it will be used as and when it is available. The Void Barnacle will refresh its target at the end of this behavior.
# '''Search for target''': no requirements. The Void Barnacle will refresh its target at the end of this behavior.

==Notes==

==Lore==
{{Lore}}

==Version History==
{{VersionHistory|
;[[Survivors of the Void]]
*(Undocumented) Added New Monster: Void Barnacle
}}

==Trivia==
*In keeping with the deep-sea theme of the Void and the monsters related to it, the Void Barnacle's visual design seems to draw inspiration from ocean life, especially crustaceans and other arthropods. Barnacles in particular, as the name implies, take visual cues from [[wikipedia:Barnacle|real barnacles (subclass ''Cirripedia'')]], which are crustaceans.
* The back of a Void Barnacle's "head" resembles a Cell Vent from the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Interactables|interactable]] introduced in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

Upon activation, the player will sacrifice 50% of their [[Health|HP]] to open the cradle. This spawns one [[Items#Void|{{Color|void|void item}}]] at the cradle's position, and releases 0-4 {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|altText=Void Infestors}}, each having a 50% chance to spawn.

The item chances are:

* 60% {{Color|void|Void}} Common
* 30% {{Color|void|Void}} {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}}
* 10% {{Color|void|Void}} {{Color|legendary|Legendary}}

This chance is affected by the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]] and as a result {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} items actually drop only 4% of the time.

== Notes ==
* Not to be confused with a [[Void Potential]] shrine, which also costs 50% HP but generates a Void Potential orb instead of an item.
* Unlike other item-dropping interactables, Void Cradles ''will ''still spawn when the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is active. However, this is true only for the Void Cradles that spawn within the [[Void Seed]] biome. Other Void Cradles that spawn naturally on a stage will '''not''' spawn.
* Avoid opening the cradle when there are enemies around, because both of the HP damage and the fact that Void Infestors can corrupt nearby enemies and make them more dangerous.
* If the player has an AoE attack, or item effects, one can kill all the Void Infestors when they spawn grouped up before they split.

== Version History ==

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monster family.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

Like other {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies, Void Devastators can spawn on any map if spawned in a [[Void Seed]].
==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Void Devastator's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

===Primary: White Bombs===
The Devastator's left cannon charges for 1.5 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and shoots a cluster of 10 small white orbs within 0.5 seconds (scales with attack speed) in 40° arc. Each orb moves at 140m/s and upon impact with the terrain it explodes dealing 80% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 in a radius of 3m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot]] falloff. It will then remain inactive until the Devastator's secondary attack is trigerred. However, after 15 seconds of inactivity it will explode dealing the same amount of damage. This attack has an end lag of 0.5 seconds which also scales with attack speed.  

{{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}} can delete the orbs both when they are launched and after they have stuck on the terrain.  

This skill has a cooldown of 3 seconds.  

=== Secondary: Black Bomb ===
The Devastator's right cannon charges for 1.5 seconds (scales with attack speed) and shoots a big black orb which moves at 30m/s and homes in on any nearby white stuck orbs. Upon impact this deals 600% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 24m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|sweet spot]] falloff. This causes any white orbs within 24m to explode for the normal damage they deal. In addition, a delayed blast is left in the place of each activated white orb which explodes after 0.4 seconds and deals 600% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 12m with sweet spot fall off. Each of these explosions can activate previously inactive white orbs in their area of effect, which can cause a massive chain reaction. This has the potential of killing the player outright.  

Defensive Microbots can block this attack.  

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds.  

===Special: Void Missiles===
The Devastator fires 7 pairs of void missiles similar to the {{ItemLink|itemName=Plasma Shrimp|altText=Plasma Shrimp's}} projectiles every 0.25 seconds (scales with attack speed). These missiles move at a speed of 40m/s and home in on the target, but they will expire after 6 seconds without an impact. They deal 30% damage each and have a proc coefficient of 1.0.

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds.

===Death: Implosion Cluster ===
When the Devastator is killed, it builds up a large implosion around itself that, after 5 seconds, instantly kills any entity within a radius of 22.5m. This also launches a cluster of 5 smaller void spherical projectiles that arch outwards and implode on impact in a radius of 3m, each having the same instant-death effect. Since these void orbs are projectiles, they can be blocked by Defensive Microbots.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special''': the Devastator must be within 300m from its target, be aiming at its target, and have less than 50% health.
# '''Use secondary and strafe''': the Devastator must be within 50m from its target. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Devastator must be within 50m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 1 second.
# '''Use secondary and chase''': the Devastator must be within 50-100m from its target. This behavior is active for 0.5 seconds.
# '''Use primary and chase''': the Devastator must be within 50-100m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 1 second.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

==Loot==
''Main article: [[Newly Hatched Zoea]]''

If the {{PAGENAME}} is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], through the [[Family Events|void family event]] or the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}}, there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the {{PAGENAME}}) to be replaced by its {{Color|void|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}}.

==Notes==
*Although the Void Devastator has a [[Items#Boss|boss item]], the chances of getting it are very low. The Void Devastator can only ever be a Teleporter Boss in the void family event (which is only a 2% chance per stage and only after [[Environments#Looping|looping]]), or when the {{ArtifactLink|Dissonance}} is active. Even if the Devastator is the Teleporter Boss, there is only a 15% chance to get the Newly Hatched Zoea as the reward (although this can be increased with [[Shrine of the Mountain|Shrines of the Mountain]] or by playing in multiplayer). Realistically, the Zoea is most commonly obtained by killing the Void Devastator with the {{ItemLink|Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} or dying when holding [[Items|Boss Items]] and {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}}.
*The death effect behaves similar to the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver|altText=Void Reaver's}} death explosion. See [[Void Reaver#Tips|here]] for how it affects all entities.

}}

==Trivia==
*In keeping with the deep-sea theme of the Void and the monsters related to it, the Void Devastator's visual design seems to draw inspiration from ocean life, especially crustaceans and other arthropods. The Devastator in particular bears many features of [[wikipedia:Crab|common crabs (infraorder ''Brachyura'')]]. 
**This link is further reinforced by the Void Devastator's associated item, {{ItemLink|Newly Hatched Zoea}}: The term "zoea" refers to a larval form present in the life cycle of some crustaceans, especially crabs.
*The Void Devastator's epithet, "Destroyer of Worlds", references a quote from the ''[[wikipedia:Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gita]]'', part of the Hindu epic [[wikipedia:Mahabharata|''Mahabharata'']]. The quote in question can be found in Chapter 11, Verse 32:
कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो [...]

Multiple English translations have been proposed. Some of them include:

# I am the mighty Time, the one who causes the loss of the world.
# I am the mighty Time, the one who causes the loss of the world.
# I am the God of Death, the one who destroys the world.
# I am Death, the destroyer of the world.

Nowadays, the quote is often mistakenly attributed to [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer Julius Robert Oppenheimer], who in 1965 during in interview, said:

''"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."''

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' are a [[Environments#Hidden Realms|Hidden Realm]] accessible only through the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}. It is a necessary location for the challenge [[...To Be Left Alone]], which unlocks the [[Survivors|Survivor]] {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}.

The Void Fields can only be accessed via the [[Bazaar Between Time#Null Portal|Null Portal]], which is located in a hidden cave in the shaft beneath the Blue Portal in the Bazaar. The Null Portal is only accessible once per run.

Until the cell is stabilized, the Void Fields will constantly "suffocate" the player for a small percentage of their current health. This suffocation effect can kill the player.

==Null Portal==
The Void Fields can only be accessed once per run via the Null Portal located at the end of a path under the player in the Bazaar Between Time.

{{clear}}
==Breaching the Cell==
To complete this Hidden Realm, players must activate and survive nine separate cell events. Each cell must be charged in a similar fashion to a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] and players are further incentivized to stand inside the cell since doing so protects them from the [[Void Fog]]. Cells have a radius of 20m, take one minute to charge, and only charge while players remain inside the cell. As long as any number of players are outside the cell, the run timer resumes and players receive an extra 25% damage exponentially for every 15 seconds they stay in the Void Fog. This extra damage resets when all the players are in the cell again. 

Additionally, each consecutive cell event will result in either a new type of enemy appearing or a new item's effects being given to the current enemies, and each cell event alternates between introducing either an enemy or an item. The first two items given to the enemies are stacks of 5 Common items, the next two are stacks of 3 {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} items, and the last is 1 {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} item. In total, by the ninth wave, there will be '''four''' different enemy types with '''five''' items. 

Upon each cell event's completion, the players will each be granted a [[Void Potential]] orb and all enemies currently in the area will be killed. The first four events grant Common items, the subsequent four grant {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} items, and the final grants a {{Color|legendary|Legendary}} item. The rewards are not tied to the items given to the enemies.

When a cell event has been completed, its safe area slowly disappears and players must make it to the next cell while under the influence of the Void Fog.

There is no obligation to complete every single cell event in order to exit the stage; the exit Null Portal is always available, allowing players to leave as soon as they want. Depending on the enemies that appear and the items they obtain, leaving early may be necessary to avoid losing a run. However, upon leaving, the Void Fields cannot be reentered for the remainder of the run.

==Interactables==
{{InteractableList}}

==Enemies==
On every other consecutive stage, a new type of enemy will appear. The selection of enemies is based on the difficulty coefficient upon entering the level. The higher the difficulty coefficient, the more likely chance that a [[Monsters#Bosses|boss]] enemy will be selected instead of regular enemies. Every enemy can be selected to be an enemy in the Void Fields, with the exception of:  

*{{MonsterLink|Hermit Crab|Hermit Crabs}}
*{{MonsterFamily|Lunar}} enemies
*{{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies
* All [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special bosses]]
*If the [[Survivors of the Void]] DLC i&lt;nowiki/&gt;s disabled, the {{MonsterLink|Clay Dunestrider}}, {{MonsterLink|Magma Worm}}, and {{MonsterLink|Overloading Worm}} will also be excluded.

On higher difficulties, {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}} can spawn. Like the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}, Scavengers will receive the monster items on top of the items pre-equipped on their spawn.
=={{SotV|Void Portal|noTooltip=true}} Void Portal==

This portal is only available if the [[Survivors of the Void]] DLC is installed.

Upon breaching all 9 cells in the Void Fields, a Void Portal will open next to the Null Portal, giving the player two choices. Entering the Void Portal will take the player to the Hidden Realm: {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, which leads to {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}.

==Logbook Entry==

The Environment Log can be found beneath the stage, on a ledge with part of a large ring slightly protruding from it. The ledge is located roughly on the opposite side of the map from the long curved ramp that leads to the exit portal. For an easier time, try getting the log on {{EntityLink|entityName=Drizzle}} difficulty to mitigate the suffocating effect. Using {{SurvivorLink|Loader}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Artificer}}, and/or mobility items like {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather}} and {{ItemLink|Milky Chrysalis}}, can also help getting to the ledge easier.

The log will disappear 5 minutes after entering the level, which means that it needs to be retrieved while the map is under the cover of darkness.

==Tips==
*The {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}} and, to a lesser extent, both {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} and the {{ItemLink|Gnarled Woodsprite}} can be used to temporarily negate the suffocation effect.  
**As of [[Survivors of the Void]], {{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} no longer blocks the suffocation effect and {{ItemLink|Planula}} no longer heals damage from it.
**On-damage items such as {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} are triggered by the suffocation effect as well.
*As of the [[Survivors of the Void Update]], {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}} can no longer reduce suffocation damage. However, {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}} and {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}} can be used as regeneration sources between Vent openings. 
**Weeping Fungus in particular is extremely useful. Unlike Bustling Fungus, it can provide healing while moving, giving more time to move to the next Vent if movement speed is lacking, or if a player has some difficulty navigating the Void Fields.
*After a cell is charged, the next cell's location can be found by following the beacon of light it emits.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Kin}} is active, no additional monster types are added past the first cell event. This can greatly reduce or increase the Void Fields' difficulty, depending on what that monster type is. 
** While the Artifact of Kin is active, it is possible that no monster will be added for the first cell event. This results in no monsters spawning at all throughout the cell events.
*If the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice}} is active, it is possible to farm items for an extended period of time, but that requires a strong enough build to offset the exponentially ramping suffocation effect and the monsters gaining copious amounts of items. Once the fog damage outperforms any healing effects, dipping in and out of the safe resets its damage rate. {{ItemLink|itemName=Medkit}} can also help with healing during that step.
*While many items aren't particularly threatening, monsters gaining certain items are made particularly dangerous:
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Focus Crystal|altText=Focus Crystals}} will double the monsters' damage if they are sufficiently close to the player, making melee enemies considerably more threatening. 
***Similarly, {{ItemLink|itemName=Lens-Maker's Glasses}} effectively increase ''all'' monsters' damage by 50%, on average.
**{{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} are highly threatening, since attacks getting the bonus damage will be 4.75 times as strong: given how each cell necessitates the player to stay within their protective radii to stabilize them in the first place, this will make staying within them for any prolonged length of time a risky prospect (as their constants regenerative properties actually end up becoming more a liability than anything, bringing players back up to that 90% threshold for said bonus to constantly proc). Unless players happen to come in with some form of [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|one-shot protection]], they might find themselves in danger extremely quickly. 
***Should they happen to receive them while the {{ArtifactLink|Glass}} is enabled, it is strongly advised to exit immediately.
**{{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate|altText=Repulsion Armor Plates}} will be a minor annoyance to heavy-hitting Survivors like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}, but ones that deal rapid low damage like {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} with {{SkillLink|skillName=Auto-Nailgun|survivorName=MUL-T}} will be crippled.
**{{ItemLink|Tougher Times}} will give monsters a whopping 42.9% chance to avoid any and all damage.
**Monsters use the same concept of secondary skills that players do if they have more than one attack, so {{ItemLink|Backup Magazine|altText=Backup Magazines}} affect these skills. For instance, a {{MonsterLink|Beetle Guard|altText=Beetle Guard's}} shockwave attack will be used six times rapidly once they get in range, rather than simply firing once and then running closer while the attack cools down.
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Kjaro's Band}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Runald's Band}} can decimate players with ruthless efficiency. Since the monsters receive 3 copies of a given Band, an attack that activates Kjaro's Band will deal 10 times the normal amount, and Runald's, 8.5 times.   
***Kjaro's Band is particularly worrisome since its flame tornado deals damage over time, separate from the initial hit. If the main attack breaks the player's one-shot protection and activates Kjaro's Band, its follow-up attack is almost sure to finish them off. Runald's Band does not have this danger since its bonus attack happens simultaneously with the activating hit.
** Should the monsters receive both {{ItemLink|Medkit|altText=Medkits}} and  {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}, it is advised to exit immediately. Any monster that is not repeatedly damaged or quickly killed will heal itself and trigger N'kuhana's Opinion multiple times. This is especially dangerous early in the game, when the Survivor usually hasn't snowballed into big, consistent DPS, but may have enough crowd control to damage monsters they can't get to or kill fast enough.
**Enemies killed after stabilizing the cell can still be revived afterwards if they have {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}}.
*{{MonsterLink|Gup}} will split into {{MonsterLink|Geep}} when killed by a cell being stabilized, which will allow the two {{MonsterLink|Geep|altText=Geeps}} to spawn, despite no cell being active. 
**Same effect applies for {{MonsterLink|Geep}} to {{MonsterLink|Gip}}.

*Other Changes
**In the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} Items are now only added to the monster pool at the start of each cell event (previously they would gain extra items if an excessive amount of time was taken to complete each cell.)
**We have reduced the [[Void Fog]] damage of the Void fields and decreased the rate at which the Void Fog damage ramps up outside of the safe zones.
**The Void Fields no longer increments the stage counter on completion.

*Void Fields
**While a Void Cell is active, time stops while you are inside the safe zone, however time resumes when any player is outside taking damage from the [[Void Fog]]. Time remains paused while you are moving from cell-to-cell between rounds.
**Void Fog damage now very slowly ramps-up over time preventing excessive time chillin’ in the Void. It is a much slower increase than other versions of Void Fog (such as [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simualcrum]]) giving you ample time moving from cell-to-cell between rounds.
**Items are now added to the monster item pool sooner if players are taking an excessive amount of time to complete a Void Cell.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a playable [[Survivors|character]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion.

It is an eldritch, void-mutated monstrosity capable of harnessing the Void as a lethal weapon. In battle, its corrupted energy builds up until it reaches a critical point, unleashing its full power and transforming it and its abilities into more aggressive versions.

Its name is stylized in-game as{{Color|Void Fiend|「V??oid Fiend』}}.

Completing the [[Dragged Below]] challenge will unlock Void Fiend as a playable survivor.

* Stylized in-game as {{Color|Void Fiend|『V??oid Co??rruption】}}.
* The {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend's}} Corruption is visible as a circular gauge, ranging from 0-100%. 
* The {{StatusEffectLink|Void Survivor Corruption}} buff indicates when the {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} is in its corrupted state and grants 100 [[armor]].
* While the {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} is uncorrupted, the Corruption gauge fills over time. While it is corrupted, the inverse is true, and Corruption depletes over time.
* Taking damage, landing [[Damage#Critical Strike|critical strikes]], and possessing {{Color|void|void items}} builds Corruption, while healing will reduce Corruption.
* For each {{Color|void|void item}} the {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} possesses, its minimum Corruption level is increased by 2%. This makes it corrupt itself faster, but does not make its corrupted duration shorter. Instead, the corruption depletes at a slower rate the more {{Color|void|void items}} it possesses.
** Minimum Corruption can be increased to 100%, which permanently locks the {{Color|void fiend|Void Fiend}} into its corrupted state. 
** Increasing it beyond 100% results in it flickering between the minimum value and 100% with no effect on gameplay.
* Corruption is reset to minimum upon advancing to the next stage.
* Receiving any healing reduces corruption percentage in either state. With enough passive healing through items its possible to avoid being corrupted without using Suppress, or simply be unable to be corrupted without instantly returning to a normal state. 
* When transforming, the {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} gets 0.5 seconds of invincibility and the cooldowns of its abilities are reset.

== Behaviors ==
''For an explanation of how these behaviors are implemented read about [[Enemy AI]]. This section only applies when the character is controlled by AI.''

# '''Use Primary (Corrupted Drown)''': Void Fiend must be within 15m from the target and have line of sight.
# '''Use secondary (Flood)''': Void Fiend must be within 10-30m from the target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 2 seconds, which means it will be charged for its duration and released at the end of it.
# '''Use secondary (Corrupted Flood)''': Void Fiend must be within 30m from the target and have line of sight.
# '''Use utility (Trespass)''': Void Fiend must be within 5-40m from the target and will sprint after its activation.
# '''Use utility (Corrupted Trespass)''': Void Fiend must be more than 40m from the target and will sprint after its activation.
# '''Use special (Suppress)''': Void Fiend must have less than 50% health and will sprint after its activation.
# '''Use special (Flee and Heal)''': Void Fiend must have less than 25%. The behavior is active for 1 second and Void Fiend will sprint for its duration.
# '''Use primary (Drown)''': Void Fiend must be within 5-50m from the target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase while using primary (Drown)''': no requirements as long as Void Fiend is not corrupted. It is observed that if Void Fiend is right next to the player, they will not use the primary but only continuously rotate around in an effort to get even closer. As such, the character can find itself in a locked state where it cannot use any other ability until its target has gained enough distance or the corrupt meter fills up and using Corrupted Drown becomes valid.
# '''Chase while using primary (Corrupted Drown)''': Void Fiend must be more than 5m from the target. Void Fiend will attempt to sprint, but will constantly toggle between sprinting and use the primary. Technically because of the very first behavior, this will only be selected if the target is more than 15m away.
# '''Flee while using primary (Drown)''': Void Fiend must be within 5m from the target. This behavior will never be selected

==Tips==
*Although it comes at the cost of {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress's}} ability to control Corruption levels, acquiring {{ItemLink|itemName=Essence of Heresy}} allows {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Drown}} to set up a large number of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Ruin}} stacks due to its high rate of fire.
*Using {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} to manage corruption throughout a stage means that the player can reach 100% Corruption right when activating the [[Teleporter]].
*{{Color|Void Fiend|Drown}} has an extremely long range when uncorrupted, allowing {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} to attack from very safe distances. {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Drown}}, in contrast, has an extremely ''short'' range but fires more quickly, encouraging aggression.
*The inherent aim assist of {{Color|Void Fiend|Drown}} can be very helpful for dealing with {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Infestor|altText=Void Infestors}}, as can the area-of-effect damage of {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Drown}}, {{Color|Void Fiend|Flood}}, and {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Flood}}.
*Releasing a fully charged {{Color|Void Fiend|Flood}} in midair while moving backwards can be a good way to put distance between {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} and enemies. Firing a fully charged shot will also launch the player upwards, which can be very useful for reaching higher spots or dodging.
**This can be used to even greater effect with {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Flood}}, as having stacks of {{itemLink|Backup Magazine}} can launch Void Fiend across the map.
**Both {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Flood}} and {{Color|Void Fiend|Flood}} can be used to prevent fall damage when shot at the ground right before landing.
**Using this method, firing multiple charges of {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Flood}} at the ground can briefly stall {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} in the air.
*Unused charges of {{Color|Void Fiend|Flood}} will reset after changing between forms. 
*Since it deals more than 400% base damage, {{Color|Void Fiend|Flood}} can trigger {{itemLink|Runald's Band}}, {{itemLink|Kjaro's Band}}, and {{itemLink|Singularity Band}} even when not fully charged.
*The channel time of {{Color|void fiend|Suppress}} is affected by {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend's}} attack speed. If attack speed is lowered too much, the delay can make it difficult to manage Corruption.
**At default attack speed, {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} accumulates an extra 3% corruption in the 1 second it takes for the skill to execute. Activating Suppress after 95% will still result in the Void Fiend becoming Corrupted.
*Interacting with a [[Shrine of Blood]] or [[Void Cradle]] increases {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend's}} corruption, allowing it to use {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} to quickly recoup some of the lost HP.
**The player should be mindful of activating either of these objects when enemies are near. Interacting with these objects can put Void Fiend into its Corrupted form, preventing it from healing with Suppress.
*Although Drown cannot be used while Flood is charging, Flood can be charged while Void Fiend is sprinting or using {{Color|void fiend|Trespass}}. Flood can also be released during the invulnerable period of {{Color|void fiend|Trespass}}.
** If repositioning isn't necessary, it can sometimes be helpful to fire {{Color|void fiend|Flood}} without charging depending on the situation.
*As {{ItemLink|Weeping Fungus}} heals {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} while it is sprinting, it can be difficult to reach maximum corruption or maintain corrupted form.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Cautious Slug}} increases base health regeneration, but does not count as healing for the purpose of lowering corruption.
*Repeated use of {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} can greatly extend how long the {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} can survive outside the safe zones in the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}} and [[Simulacrum]], especially with high attack speed.
*With a high number of {{Color|void|void items}}, it is possible to transform almost on demand by either not using {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} to become corrupted or by ceasing attacking to become uncorrupted.
*When reaching 100% minimum Corruption by having 50+ {{Color|void|void items}}, using uncorrupted skills becomes impossible. While this is unlikely to happen in the majority of runs, keep it in mind when using the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} or on long runs.
*While healing reduces the corruption meter by an equivalent percentage of the full health fraction healed, using the {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} skill always removes 25% corruption regardless of how much healing is received.
**This makes {{ItemLink|Rejuvenation Rack}} extremely potent, while playing on [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 5]] difficulty negates its effectiveness.
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Corpsebloom}} will remove 25% corruption even though no healing is received. It will then remove another 50% slowly as the healing from the item is released. This makes it quite difficult to build up the corruption meter.
**Similarly, {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Suppress}} will always increase the corruption meter whether any damage is received or not. {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}} make it possible to extend the corrupted form without sacrificing any health.
*While {{ItemLink|itemName=Lysate Cell|altText=Lysate Cells}} can increase the number of {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Suppress}} charges, picking up a Lysate Cell while in the corrupted form will not grant an extra until reentering its corrupted state.
**Conversely, {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} does instantly detect the change and provides an extra charge. However, an extra charge of Suppress is redundant and not beneficial if corruption is available.
*If {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} has at least 13 {{Color|void|void items}}, it can heal infinitely using {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}}.
* The {{ItemLink|Topaz Brooch}} can be useful for {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}}. Gaining [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] does not reduce corruption like healing, but will still increase corruption when {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} is damaged. 
*Because critical strikes increase corruption, items such as {{ItemLink|Lens-Maker's Glasses}}, {{ItemLink|Predatory Instincts}}, and {{ItemLink|Harvester's Scythe}} can help increase corruption in early stages. 
**The {{ItemLink|itemName=Ocular HUD}} is excellent for maintaining 100% corruption when using {{Color|Void Fiend|Corrupted Drown}}, greatly increasing damage output and prolonging the corrupted transformation.
*Unsurprisingly, {{Color|Void Fiend|Void Fiend}} is well-suited to surviving in the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Fields}}. The damage from {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Void Fog}} increases its corruption, allowing use of {{Color|Void Fiend|Suppress}} to heal. This makes exploring the Void Fields far less daunting of a task, even with almost no items.
**This is useful but not nearly as effective in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]], where Void Fog damage increases progressively. The player should also be careful about managing the corruption meter as the skill activation delay and accumulated damage can transform Void Fiend into its corrupted form. Being stranded in the Void Fog without healing is usually lethal.

==Trivia==
*The Void Fiend is a corrupted {{SurvivorLink|Commando}}, although it is ''not'' the Commando who escaped [[Petrichor V]] during the events of Risk of Rain 1.
*Its Umbra title is stylized in-game as 『Co??rupted Am?nesiac】.
*Its endings are stylized in-game as "『..and s?o it c??omes】... 「fo?r al?l of us.』" and "『..a?nd so it v?ani??shed』, 「a wh?isper in the d??arkness』" respectively.
** Unlike the other Survivors, the Void Fiend's 'Escaped' ending phrase doesn't use the regular "..and so [he/she/they/it] left" phrase.
*Since the Void Fiend has two sets of moves that it alternates between based on Corruption, it is the only Survivor who has no alternate loadout skills.
*Instead of starting in an Escape Pod like most other survivors, the Void Fiend drops in a spherical pod, similar in shape to that of a lunar pod, that launches it slightly upwards upon emerging. It also emerges instantly upon pressing the interact key, rather than after a brief delay to open the Escape Pod door like most other survivors.
*It is possible that like {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}}, the Void Fiend was caught and/or imprisoned by void monsters during its time as a Commando.
**Unlike Acrid, who was imprisoned in the Void Fields, Void Fiend's logbook entry suggests it was instead held in the Simulacrum for training.
*Unlike every other survivor in the game (who usually have green HP bars), Void Fiend's HP bar is colored purple like [[Family Events#Void|Void]] [[Monsters#Voidtouched|creatures]].
*Void Fiend's body shakes more violently in proportion to Corruption level.
*Void Fiend can turn its head 360°.
*The Void Fiend’s abilities show up in the Logbook Entry. 
*When Using Suppress as the Purified Void Fiend, a small green ball of energy appears in the Void Fiend’s hand and is crushed by it.

      <text bytes="8731" sha1="5pi6m9eb1qty9cr3pyv29857wzvcuzw" xml:space="preserve">'''Void Fog''' is the rapidly-ticking damage dealt by areas in the Void. These areas are accompanied by one or more bubbles in which the effect is cleared.

The {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=VoidFog}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=VoidFogStrong}} [[Status Effects#Debuffs|debuffs]] given to the player are purely visual and only serve as indicators to the player, as the damage dealt is by a controller on the stage. The debuffs persist for 4 and 5 seconds respectively after leaving the damage areas, but damage stops applying the moment the player leaves the area.

The damage dealt bypasses armor, so it bypasses:

*Hidden Invincibility
** {{ItemLink|itemName=Goobo Jr.}}'s initial spawn
** {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Mercenary}}'s skills that give invincibility ({{SkillLink|skillName=Blinding Assault}}, {{SkillLink|skillName=Focused Assault}}, and {{SkillLink|skillName=Eviscerate}})
**Spawning into the stage
**{{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Void Fiend}}'s transformation into its {{SkillLink|skillName=Void Corruption}} form
** {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade}} ({{ItemLink|itemName=Strides of Heresy}})
*Any type of Armor:
**[[Armor]]
**[[Armor#Adaptive Armor|Adaptive Armor]]
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate}}
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Planula}}
* Any type of blocking:
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}}
**{{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}
However, {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Seeker|altText=Seeker's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Sojourn}} makes her {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=SojournVehicle|altText=immune to damage}} from any non-sojourn sources, including '''Void Fog'''. Take note that her fog stacks (see Mechanics below) still increase even if she doesn't take the damage that accumulates during it and can surprise the player when she exits Sojourn.

==Mechanics==
Every &lt;code&gt;tickPeriodSeconds&lt;/code&gt; that the player is outside of the safe zone, they take damage according to a formula. Furthermore, every &lt;code&gt;rampIncreaseCooldown&lt;/code&gt; they gain 1 fog stack which increases any subsequent damage. Once the player goes back into the safe zone, the stacks are reset to zero. The safe area is inverted in {{SotV}}'''Void Seeds''', which means the player is safe outside of them but takes damage inside of them. There are two types of damage formulas, standard and exponential, and their values for each Void Fog source are summarised in the table below.

When an entity first enters the fog it starts with 0 stacks. For example, something with 600 health in the {{SotV}}'''Simulacrum''' takes 6 damage every 0.2 seconds for 5 seconds which then increases to 6.12 for the next 5 seconds and so on. 

===Standard damage===
Initially any entity takes

&lt;math&gt;baseDamage = maxCombinedHealth \times healthFractionPerSecond \times tickPeriodSeconds&lt;/math&gt;

damage per tick. This is repeated for &lt;math&gt;rampIncreaseCooldown / tickPeriodSeconds&lt;/math&gt;ticks, so by the end of this period the entity has accumulated

&lt;math&gt;baseDamage = maxCombinedHealth \times healthFractionPerSecond \times rampIncreaseCooldown&lt;/math&gt;

total damage. For any following periods the entity receives an additional damage term, defined as

&lt;math&gt;rampDamage = baseDamage \times healthFractionRampCoefficientPerSecond \times tickPeriodSeconds&lt;/math&gt;

for each fog stack. If the entity is to stay in the danger zone for 5 periods (each of which is 5 seconds long), this contributes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 fog stacks respectively, which can be generalised as an arithmetic sum with &lt;math&gt;periods \times (periods - 1) / 2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the accumulated damage one is expected to receive over a period of time is:

&lt;math&gt;totalDamage = baseDamage \times periods + rampDamage \times periods \times (periods - 1) / 2&lt;/math&gt;

Continuing the example for {{SotV}}'''Simulacrum''', substituing all the relevant constants in and solving the quadratic equation &lt;math&gt;totalDamage = maxCombinedHealth&lt;/math&gt; with respect to ''periods'', we conclude that any entity can take damage for 3.88 periods, or 19.4 seconds, before dying. This assumes the entity enters the danger zone at full health and does not receive any healing for its duration. This also ignores [[Health#Health Regenaration|regen]] which has a very minor effect of extending one's life.

===Exponential damage ===
This type of damage only occurs in {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}. The general formula is

&lt;math&gt;baseDamage = maxCombinedHealth \times healthFractionPerSecond \times healthFractionRampCoefficientPerSecond^{fogStacks} \times tickPeriodSeconds&lt;/math&gt;

For each fog stack this damage is repeated for &lt;math&gt;rampIncreaseCooldown / tickPeriodSeconds&lt;/math&gt;ticks, so by the end of any period the entity has accumulated

&lt;math&gt;baseDamage = maxCombinedHealth \times healthFractionPerSecond \times healthFractionRampCoefficientPerSecond^{period} \times rampIncreaseCooldown&lt;/math&gt;

damage. This means after 10 seconds, i.e. ''period=0'', an entity has lost 25% of its max health. After another 10 seconds it has lost another 31.25% of its max health, and so on. In total it takes 30.8 seconds to lose all health and die, assuming no healing in the meantime.

Furthermore, while a cell vent is active there is a second type of stack that increases for every 15 seconds any players are outside the safe zone, which modifies the total damage exponentially (on top of its default exponential effect) by &lt;math&gt;totalDamage \times 1.25^{stack}&lt;/math&gt;. This effect does not change the damage taken in the first few period noticeably, as the player in this scenario only survives for 28 seconds in the fog without healing. However, this term eventually dominates any other fog damage contribution, making it very difficulty to stay in the Void Fog while a cell is active for a prolonged period of time. The stack type is reset to 0 when all players all inside the cell vent once again.

===Graph===
[[File:Void_Fog_Damage_Graph.png]]

==Notes== 

*If the player is within the overlap of multiple sources of Void Fog damage, e.g., two Void Seeds, each source will tick and keep track of the fog stack count independently from the rest.
**However, this is not the case for {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, where there is one global fog controller which manages multiple safe zones. This means that if there are multiple Deep Void Signals active, the player will not take any damage as long as they are inside any of the safe zones.
*While the {{ItemLink|itemName=Weeping Fungus}} can greatly extend the time a player can survive inside the Void Fog, the {{ItemLink|itemName=Personal Shield Generator}} has the opposite effect, since it cannot be regenerated while taking damage and it also amplifies the incoming damage since it contributes towards the character max health.
*Void Fog damage is halved for {{ArtifactLink|Devotion|Devoted Lemurians}}.
*When a character enters the Void Fog, they gain a stack of {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Void Fog Stack Cooldown}} for ''rampIncreaseCooldown'' seconds, during which time they cannot gain another fog stack. However, being a cooldown buff it can be cleansed by {{ItemLink|itemName=Blast Shower}}, which can have the adverse effect of instantly giving another fog stack to the player, thereby increasing the damage take while in the danger zone much earlier than expected.
**Holding {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}} in conjunction with this equipment can make things worse by removing any control of when and how frequently the equipment is activated.
**This is mostly an issue in {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} where the damage ramps up exponentially.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update.

==Environments==
*Any where a [[Void Seed]] or [[Void Cradle]] can spawn.

==Skills &amp; Behavior ==
Void Infestors do not naturally spawn in the world. There are 2 special ways they can appear: 0-4 Void Infestors will spawn after interacting with a [[Void Cradle]], and when defeating a {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} [[Monsters#Voidtouched|Elite]] monster, a single Void Infestor will appear from its corpse.

Unlike other monsters, Void Infestors' health decays over time, and they will die within 30 seconds even if no damage is dealt.

After appearing, a Void Infestor will move quickly and erratically, making it difficult for [[Survivors]] to hit it. 

===Primary: Infest===
The Infestor makes a flying leap towards its target. Upon contact and if the target is a non-player, non-mechanical entity, the Infestor latches onto it and the victim becomes Voidtouched. These Voidtouched characters become hostile to Survivors and monsters alike, even if they were previously allied when uninfested. 

If the character the Infestor touches cannot be infested, the attack simply deals 100% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0 and stuns the victim if possible.  

After defeating a Voidtouched monster, the Void Infestor will leave the monster's corpse, and it can infest another target if it is not defeated. Note that the Infestor entering and the Infestor exiting the host are not the same entity, with the latter having full health.

This skill has a cooldown of 5 seconds.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Flee''': the Infestor must be within 25m from its target. This is preparatory to attempting to infest the target.
# '''Use primary''': the Infestor must be within 25-80m from its target and have line of sight. The Infestor will reselect a target after this.
# '''Chase off nodegraph''': the Infestor must be within 10m from its target and have line of sight. This does not seem to be a selectable behavior because fleeing at short distances takes priority.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. If the primary is on cooldown, the Infestor will keep switching between fleeing and approaching as it crosses the 25m distance barrier.

==Notes==
*The Void Infestor's level and stats vary depending on how it is spawned. If it is spawned by a Void Cradle, it will follow the monster level and have [[Difficulty#Unique scaling|unique scaling]]. This is because they are spawned by the same "special encounter" process that spawns [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special bosses]]. However, if the Void Infestor is spawned by killing a Voidtouched monster, it will always be at level 1 with no unique scaling, which makes it easier to kill.
**This makes Void Infestors spawned by Void Cradles especially dangerous in the lategame even in the absence of other monsters since they can leap at the player and kill them in one shot.
*Due to the Voidtouched Elites' ability to apply {{StatusEffectLink|Fracture}}, Void Infestors are particularly dangerous and can end up killing a Survivor very quickly if they are let loose.
**This is especially the case for allies that are summoned by items such as the {{ItemLink|Squid Polyp}} or {{ItemLink|Queen's Gland}}. These allies are extremely powerful and, when infested, can kill a player in mere moments.
*There is no obvious audio indicator for if an ally becomes infested, so players should keep an eye on their allies if they lose sight of a Void Infestor.
*Infestors will not attempt to infest "mechanical" allies like [[Interactables#Drones|drones]], {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets ({{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret}} or {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret}}), or {{ItemLink|itemName=Goobo Jr.|altText=gummy clones}} or {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|umbrae}} of {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=MUL-T}} and {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=REX}}.

}}

==Trivia==
*The "596f757220707269736f6e" in this monster's logbook entry is hexadecimal for "Your prison".
*In keeping with the deep-sea theme of the Void and the monsters related to it, the Void Infestor's visual design seems to draw inspiration from ocean life, especially crustaceans and other arthropods. Infestors in particular bear a striking resemblance to [[wikipedia:Giant isopod|giant isopods (family Cirolanidae).]] 
** Another possible inspiration for the appearance and behavior of the Infestor is ''[[wikipedia:Orthione griffenis|Orthione griffenis,]]'' a more derived and parasitic species of isopod that latches on to and feeds from the gill chambers of crayfish.
*When a Void Infestor infests a body, it immediately dies and gives the Voidtouched Elite equipment to the enemy. When the Voidtouched enemy dies, a new Infestor with full health is spawned at the enemy's location.
**The new Infestor will only spawn if the Voidtouched enemy has run out of lifes, i.e., no remaining {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Pluripotent Larva}}.
*An Infestor spawned from a Void Cradle does so with the special procedure that also spawns [[Monsters#Special Bosses|Special Bosses]] and as such has [[Difficulty#Unique scaling|unique scaling]]. However, an Infestor spawned from a Voidtouched enemy only spawns at level 1 with no unique scaling. This makes Infestors spawned by the latter method much easier to kill.
** Since both spawning methods are special, Infestors do not inherit any items from the {{ArtifactLink|Evolution}}.
*With the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}} enabled, it is possible for a Void Infestor to infest another Infestor and make it Voidtouched. If this Voidtouched Infestor infests a new enemy, the Voidtouched Infestor will die (thus respawning the Infestor that had infested it) and the enemy will become Voidtouched.
**Since the Infestor's attempt to infest an entity is technically an attack, a Voidtouched Infestor can inflict Collapse on the entity it infests.
*If a player or enemy holding the {{ItemLink|itemName=Wake of Vultures}} kills a Voidtouched enemy, they will gain the Voidtouched buff. If the holder of the Wake of Vultures dies before the buff expires, they will spawn a Void Infestor even though they were never infested by one.
*Infestors do not discriminate against Voidtouched enemies and can infest them. If an Infestor infests an enemy that is already Voidtouched, the Infestor will simply die with no noticeable effect.
*When a Voidtouched {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Gup}} or {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Geep}} dies, its descendants inherit its [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] (and thus its Elite type). Therefore, killing a single Voidtouched Gup and its descendants results in a total of 7 Infestors spawning. 
** The Infestors may not necessarily infest new enemies, as they may target the Voidtouched Geeps and Gips.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monster family.

== Environments ==
{{EnvironmentList}}

Like other {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies, Void Jailers can spawn on any map if spawned in a [[Void Seed]].

== Skills &amp; Behavior ==
The Void Jailer is one of the more dangerous Void enemies due to its high burst damage and ability to grab and draw in the player at a distance.

Any single instance of damage that deals more than 15% of the Void Jailer's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Void Darts ===
The Void Jailer charges his left arm for 1 second (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]) and fires a volley of 12 Void Darts in a shotgun-like burst. The projectiles originate from a random point within a circle in front of the Jailer, meaning the bullets begin with some amount of spread between each other rather than from a single origin. Each projectile moves at 100m/s for 2 seconds and deals 200% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0, {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Slow50|altText=slowing down}} the victim in the process for 2 seconds. Getting hit with all projectiles at once can deal a devastating blow, especially in the late game.

The individual darts can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

This skill has an end lag of 3 seconds, but the Void Jailer can activate the same skill after only 2 seconds. Both of these durations scale with attack speed.

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds and 3 charges. The cooldown starts the moment the projectiles have been fired and will be reset if this skill is activated again. This means a charge will only be replenished if this skill is not used for 4 consecutive seconds.

=== Secondary: Nullifying Pull ===
The Void Jailer charges his right arm for 1 second (scales with attack), which causes a long tube of purple particles to getting sucked towards it. Upon launching the attack, it searches for a target that is within a 10° field of view and up to 100m away from the Void Jailer, prioritising targets that are as close to the Jailer's aiming direction, even if there are further away. The attack deals 30% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0, inflicts {{StatusEffectLink|Nullified}} for 2 seconds, and pulls the target towards the Void Jailer. The pull has the potential of pulling the target into a swarm of enemies, or even towards a cliff where fall damage can be dangerous. However, the victim can still use their skills and jump to cancel any fall damage while Nullified.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds.

=== Death: Seeking Implosion ===
Unlike the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Reaver}} and {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Void Devastator}}'s black hole, the Jailer's death fires a moving variation of the black hole that chases after a randomly selected victim, and implodes after 5 seconds of travel in a 6m radius. The death orb moves slowly at 10m/s, which makes it possible to outrun at the default sprint speed of most survivors.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use secondary''': the Void Jailer must be within 80m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 80% health.
# '''Use primary and chase''': the Void Jailer must be within 45-80m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 3 seconds.
# '''Use primary and strafe''': the Void Jailer must be within 1-45m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior is active for 3 seconds. Note that due to the Void Jailer's model size and its internal origin location, being more than 1m away from it is always guaranteed.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* Void Jailers are arguably the most dangerous non-boss enemy in Risk of Rain 2, with an absurdly powerful shotgun attack, the ability to freeze and pull players and a homing void implosion. They should not only be of the highest priority in any situation, but should be immediately called out in multiplayer games. Furthermore due to their damage being split up, they can even bypass one-shot projection if the first projectile doesn't trigger it.
** Elite Jailers are even more problematic. Due to the absurd 1.0 proc on their shotgun attack, getting hit by a{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Blazing}} or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Voidtouched}} Jailer is a death sentence in most cases, while the increased damage means {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Celestine}} and {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Malachite}} Jailers will simply one shot even the most armoured and highest HP of survivors.
** On the bright side however, jailers are incredibly powerful allies to get from either {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}} or {{ItemLink|itemName=Newly Hatched Zoea}}. In particular enemies will rarely be able to outrun their seeking implosion.
* Jailers should be fought as far away as possible; not only is their shotgun deadly but being at even medium range puts the player at danger of their extremely hard to avoid pull.
* If the player has the {{ItemLink|Strides of Heresy}}, activating {{SkillLink|Shadowfade|heretic}} while being pulled will prevent the player from being pulled further. However, they will still be Nullified unless it is activated beforehand.
* When{{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Nullified}} and lacking an escape or dodge method, the best response is to try to stagger the Jailer which requires dealing at least 15% of its HP in one hit, or triggering a {{ItemLink|itemName=Stun Grenade}}. Failing that, killing the jailer before it can fire is the only other option giving you a few seconds to escape the seeking implosion.

Jailers in particular incorporate several elements from shrimp, particularly [[wikipedia:Alpheidae|pistol shrimp (''Alpheidae'')]], such as the long, thin head and antennae, the asymmetrical arms, and small, spindly legs.
** Additionally, pistol shrimp have a specialized hunting adaptation: by snapping shut its claw at high speed, a pistol shrimp can depressurize a small pocket of water so much that it creates a bubble of vapor, known as a cavitation bubble. Since the water pressure around the bubble is so much higher than inside it, the bubble rapidly collapses and generates a shock wave powerful enough to stun or kill the shrimp's prey. It is possible that the Jailer launching an imploding void bubble at its target is in reference to this behavior.
*The line "deep, deeper, yet deeper" in the lore may be a reference to the infamous Entry Number 17 from [https://undertale.fandom.com/f Undertale], where a similar line  of "DARK DARKER YET DARKER''"'' is written in Wingdings font. 
*Assuming all projectiles land, the Void Jailers Void Dart attack is tied for the highest damage from ''any'' single attack from any monster in the entire game, dealing a whopping 2,400% damage in total, tying its damage with{{MonsterLink|monsterName=Mithrix|altText=Mithrix's}} hammer slam. Furthermore since each of its 12 projectiles have a 1.0 proc coef, it is much more likely to bypass one-shot protection.
**Theoretically, Mithrix's 'Big Spinny' and the {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Scavenger|altText=Scavenger's}} thqwibs can deal more damage, but both would require a creature to stand in a fairly specific spot to get hit by every single projectile.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a Hidden Realm [[Environments|Environment]] introduced in ''[[Survivors of the Void]]''. It can be accessed through the Void Portal after breaching all 9 cells in the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}}, as a randomly spawning portal after a teleporter event with a 10% chance from Stage 7 onwards (it is likely this is an off-by-one error as the intended behavior was to be spawnable after [[Environments#Looping|looping]]), or as a possible Lunar Seer option in the {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time}}. It contains many [[Void Potential]]s and [[Void Cradle|Cradles]] in place of chests, and is inhabited by {{MonsterFamily|Void}} [[monsters]].

==Deep Void Signal==
The Void Locus contains 4 randomly placed Deep Void Signals, which act very similar to the Cells in the Void Fields. Once one is activated, a protective bubble forms around the Signal, the entire Void Locus fills with [[Void Fog]] that will continuously damage all players and their allies that are not inside the bubble's radius, and multiple Void enemies are spawned. The player(s) will have to remain inside the bubble until the Signal is fully charged. After one has finished charging, the air in the Void Locus will be safe again until another Signal is activated. Once all four are charged, another Void Portal will form near the top of the Hidden Realm, leading to {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}.
==Environment Log==

The Environment Log for Void Locus is located on top of a helix-like structure. The Log is floating inside the gravity beam, that passes through the entire level and the top of the helix-like structure. The Log will disappear 5 minutes after entering the stage.

File:Void Locus - Envinroment Log 2.jpg|Environment Log in the beam on top of structure.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Tips==

*If playing in multiplayer, make sure every player is near the Deep Void Signal before activating it, as they can be quickly overwhelmed by the ensuing Void Fog damage.
*It is recommended for players to ''not'' bring {{ItemLink|itemName=Focused Convergence}}, as this will dramatically shrink the protective bubbles around the Deep Void Signals, which will make it significantly harder to dodge Void enemy attacks (such as the {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator|altText=Void Devastator's}} bombs, which can be placed inside the bubble) while staying out of the Void Fog.

==Trivia==

* Translated into proper Roman Numerals, the cell number reads: III - VIII - III - LVIII - V - LVI - LI - V - L - L - LV - V - VI - LI - V - LI 
**... which can be read as: 3 - 8 - 3 - 58 - 5 - 56 - 51 - 5 - 50 - 50 - 55 - 5 - 6 - 51 - 5 - 51.
*The lore references [[Chef]], a returning survivor from the original Risk of Rain.

      <text bytes="5199" sha1="b3j8v21n9msss836mwxbrz7xns7k6y5" xml:space="preserve">The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' refers to both an interactable and a loot object introduced in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' update. The article will refer to the ''Void Potential Chest'' and ''Void Potential Orb'' to distinguish between the two.

==Void Potential Chest==
[[File:VoidPotential2.PNG|128px|thumb|right|alt=|A Void Potential After Being Opened, the orb resting next to it]]
''(Not to be confused with [[Void Cradle]]s, which also cost 50% HP but generate void items directly instead of orbs.)''

The Void Potential Chest costs 50% of the player's [[Health|HP]], similar to a [[Shrine of Blood]]. Instead of an item, it generates a Void Potential Orb.

==Void Potential Orb==
[[File:CollapsingVectorsVoid.png|128px|thumb|right|alt=|A void potential showing the three possible items that one can select]]
[[File:Simulacrum-wave-5-lunar-rarity-void-potential-orb.png|128px|thumb|right|alt=|A {{Color|lunar|lunar}} orb with a different outline]]
The Void Potential Orb is an object which holds 3 random '''unique''' items. Upon interacting with it, a menu labeled "Collapsing Potential Vectors" brings up item selections. Similar to the {{ArtifactLink|Command}}'s command essence the player can only choose one, which will transform the orb into the selected item.

The Void Potential Orb can be found as loot from the Void Potential Chest and the [[Chests#Encrusted Cache|Encrusted Cache]]. It is also dropped as a reward upon completing a Cell Vent in the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} or a wave in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]].

The Void Potential Orb is defined by two characteristics: its color and its [[Items|loot rarity distribution]]. While the color is not strictly tied to the rarity distribution, it is thematically linked to it. It is important to note that an orb of a certain color which is spawned by two different methods does not share the same rarity distribution, e.g., white orb from a Void Potential Chest and Simulacrum. The rarity distribution for each version of the Void Potential Orb is listed below:

*White orb from Void Potential: same as a [[Chests#Small Chest|Small Chest]].
*{{Color|void|Purple}} orb from Encrusted Cache: see {{ItemLink|itemName=Encrusted Key}}.
*White/{{Color|uncommon|green}}/{{Color|legendary|red}} orbs from the Void Fields: only common/{{Color|uncommon|uncommon}}/{{Color|legendary|legendary}} items respectively.
* White/{{Color|uncommon|green}}/{{Color|legendary|red}}/{{Color|lunar|blue}}/{{Color|void|purple}} orbs from Simulacrum: see [[Alternate Game Modes#Waves|Simulacrum rewards]].

If the {{ArtifactLink|Command}} is enabled, Void Potential Orbs are replaced with command essence whose rarity is based on the '''color''' of the orb. This means that a white orb in Simulacrum always gives common item options only to the player. The {{Color|void|purple}} orb from both the Encrusted Cache and the Simulacrum rewards have {{Color|void|void}} common items only. The {{Color|lunar|blue}} orb in Simulacrum can normally select from both items and equipment, but as a command essence it has {{Color|lunar|lunar}} items only.

==Notes ==

*For information about how opening the Void Potential calculates damage, see [[Shrine of Blood]].
*Unlike the Void Cradle, Void Potentials don't generate {{MonsterLink|Void Infestor|Void Infestors}}.
*Each of the 3 possible options on the orb rolls for their rarity individually, meaning that, often times, one can obtain an orb that offers a common tier item option, an uncommon tier item option and a legendary tier item option. 
**It is worth noting that {{ItemLink|Eulogy Zero}} can also turn any number of the 3 options into a lunar item. This transformation is rolled independently for each of the original unique rewards and as such it is possible to roll for the same lunar item more than once.
*All 3 options are guaranteed to be unique. After the first item has been chosen, it will be removed from the weighted selection for the next one. Due to the [[Chests#Drop Chance Bias|drop chance bias]], this affects that rarity distribution for the second. Similarly, the first two items will affect the third item. As a result, that actual chances to see an item of any rarity is not exactly as expected, but the difference is no more than 2% statistically from the expected value.
*Since all {{Color|void|void}} rarities share the same color, one can also craft a purple orb whose command essence gives only {{Color|void|void}} {{Color|legendary|legendary}} items, for example. While this does not occur in the official game version, it is possible with mods.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a crustacean-like [[Monsters|monster]] added in the ''Hidden Realms'' Update, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Void}} monster family. Unlike other void enemies, it can appear on {{EntityLink|Siphoned Forest}}, {{EntityLink|Rallypoint Delta}}, {{EntityLink|Siren's Call}}, and {{EntityLink|Sky Meadow}} after [[Environments#Looping|looping]], without the presence of a [[Void Seed]] or [[Family Events|Family Event]].

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

Like other {{MonsterFamily|Void}} enemies, Void Reavers can spawn on any map if spawned in a [[Void Seed]].

==Skills &amp; Behavior==
Any single instance of damage that deals more than 50% of the Void Reaver's total health will stun it and interrupt its attacks or movement.

=== Primary: Void Artillery ===
The Void Reaver attacks by dropping several Nullifier Bombs in a rough line near the target. After 1 second, the bombs explode in a 5m radius for 100% damage. Additionally, the bombs inflict the stacking {{StatusEffectLink|NullifyStack}} debuff; when it stacks 3 times, the victim is{{StatusEffectLink|Nullified}} and their [[Movement Speed|movement speed]] becomes 0. This attack has exceptionally long range, so a Void Reaver can usually begin attacking a player the moment it notices them. 

The spacing between the bombs varies, but they are always equally spaced apart. 

Each bomb has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0. 

=== Death: Implosion ===
When the Void Reaver dies, a delayed implosion will '''''&lt;u&gt;instantly kill&lt;/u&gt;''''' ''anything'' within a 15m radius 3 seconds later, even the Void Reaver's allies and other Void Reavers.  

The implosion is heralded by a siren-like sound and a sphere of void particles building up around the defeated Void Reaver. 
=== Behaviors ===
The Void Reaver is one of the few monsters in the game with full 360° vision.
# '''Use Primary and Flee''' : the Void Reaver must be within 0-11m from its target. It will attempt to back away while doing so in order to create distance. This behavior cannot be selected twice in a row.
# '''Use Primary and Strafe''': the Void Reaver must be within 11-200m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Use Primary and Chase''': the Void Reaver must be within 200-400m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements.

== Tips ==
* The Void Reaver does not deal particularly high damage, attacking only by means of laying relatively weak and highly telegraphed explosions on the ground. The real danger comes from its ability to immobilize the player and its death implosion. This implosion deals a special type of damage internally referred to as "Void Death".
* The Void Death damage type ignores the damage number associated with it. Instead, it has been designed such that it immediately kills whatever receives the damage type in and of itself, regardless of the amount. This means [[Armor]] as well as protection items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}} are completely ignored and incapable of affecting the outcome.
** Alongside this damage type, implosions are also capable of friendly fire, meaning it will not only kill players, but it will also kill monsters (including other Void monsters) and bosses. 
** Two notable exceptions to this rule are {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} and {{MonsterLink|Voidling}}, which are immune to the Void Death damage type. In these cases, it applies the damage normally. This means that the base damage of the Reaver is dealt instead, should they be hit by the implosion.
** Another exception to this rule is that {{SkillLink|skillName=Shadowfade|survivorName=Heretic}} and {{SkillLink|skillName=Trespass|survivorName=Void Fiend}} remove the player's hitbox completely. As a result, the player can't actually be hit by anything in the first place, and by extension, cannot receive the damage.
* Void Reavers possess the second highest health of any non-boss enemy in the game, only behind {{MonsterLink|Void Jailer|Void Jailers}} (and with only the {{MonsterLink|Lunar Chimera (Golem)|Lunar Chimera Golem}} even coming close out of the other base game enemies). This makes them quite difficult to kill, especially with how risky it is to get closer to deal more damage.
* [[Interactibles#Drones|Drones]] caught in the implosion will instantly be destroyed, but instead of vanishing, they will fall to the ground and can be repaired as normal.
* Since the Void Reaver's death implosion kills any character, friend or foe, Void Reaver ghosts spawned from the {{ItemLink|Happiest Mask}} and allied Reavers spawned by {{ItemLink|itemName=Newly Hatched Zoea}} are still dangerous to the player.
* When a Void Reaver is killed by another Void Reaver's implosion, it will also implode. This makes eliminating large groups of Reavers extremely dangerous but also easy, as the implosion will trigger a terrifyingly lethal chain reaction.
** Although difficult to utilize, this can be useful to defeat high-health enemies such as some [[Monsters#Elites|Elites]], {{MonsterLink|Scavenger|Scavengers}} and bosses.

== Trivia==
*Void Reaver corpses can be observed both around the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}} and the Null Portal in the {{EntityLink|Bazaar Between Time}}. The latter ones are impaled by spikes of what appears to be purple glass.
*Dying to the Void Reaver's implosion yields a unique death message: "You have been detained. Await your sentence at the end of Time." If another player in a multiplayer game is killed by the implosion, the death message seen by everyone else is "&lt;name&gt; has vanished without a trace."
**This is most likely a reference to how the Void Reavers imprison creatures in the Void Fields.
* In keeping with the deep-sea theme of the Void and the monsters related to it, the Void Reaver's visual design seems to draw inspiration from ocean life, especially crustaceans and other arthropods. As noted in their lore entry, Reavers in particular bear a striking resemblance to [[wikipedia:Crab|common crabs (infraorder ''Brachyura'')]].

'''{{PAGENAME}}s''' are entities that can appear on a stage and create a dome of purple [[Void Fog|void fog]], added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. 

Entering the area makes the player's screen darker and causes them to take Void Fog damage, similar to the {{EntityLink|Void Fields}} but less damaging. Any [[interactables]] that are inside the Void Seed's radius, including [[Void Cradle]]s, will be locked. In order to unlock them, all {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} [[Monsters#Voidtouched|Elite]] and void enemies, denoted by a secondary objective on the player's HUD, must be defeated. These enemies can be distinguished from regular enemies by their bright purple sheen, a {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Infestor}} on their body, and purple health bars. 

== Notes==
*By looking away from a void-enemy, then looking back, a small purple circle will quickly appear in a player's vision, which can be seen even through walls. This can help the player find the last Void enemy.
*Within a Void Seed's radius, tendrils with a "balloon" at the top can appear, called a Stalk. When in interaction range of the Stalk, a message will pop up reading "Crack this sucker open!" A small amount of gold will be gained, and a small animation will play of the balloon bursting and the shoot falling over.
*More than one Void Seed can be active in a stage at any given time up to a maximum of 3. This chance appears to be affected by [[difficulty]] scaling, including the presence of additional players.
**The HUD will display each active Void Seed separately with their own monster counters. However, the Voidtouched Elites are tracked globally despite this, meaning defeating one will decrement the monster counter for ''all'' active seeds.
**If the player is inside the overlap of multiple Void Seeds, the void fog damage will be tracked independently for each one.
*Void Seeds can be generated regardless of whether or not the player has picked up any [[Items#Void|void items]].
*Voidtouched Elites will spawn Void Infestors when defeated, which if not defeated quickly enough can infest other enemies and cause the objective counter to track the newly infested enemy, effectively resetting the player's progress from the initial enemy.
* Any monsters spawned by Void Seeds (both void and Voidtouched) are always spawned on the void team, which makes them hostile to other naturally-spawned monsters. If any void enemies spawn naturally on the map, e.g., due to a [[Family Event]], they will be on the monster team and effectively hostile to any void enemies from the Void Seed.
*Void enemies such as the {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Reaver}}, {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Jailer}}, and {{EntityLink|entityName=Void Barnacle}} can spawn as part of Void Seeds. Void Barnacles can be particularly troublesome to deal with as they are immobile and often will remain inside of the Void Seed itself.
*The {{MonsterLink|Void Devastator}} is a boss monster that can spawn inside of void seeds late-run.
* If a {{MonsterLink|Gup}} is Voidtouched, killing it and splitting it into 2 Geeps is not sufficient for clearing the Void Seed, even though the resulting Geeps are not Voidtouched. The player must kill the Geeps and Gips spawned by a Voidtouched Gup as well in order to progress the Void Seed. This may be a bug.
*Players can spawn inside of a Void Seed, much to their detriment. This may be addressed in a future patch.
*Void Seeds are less likely to spawn if the {{ArtifactLink|Sacrifice|Artifacts of Sacrifice}} is enabled.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an alternate final [[Monsters#Special Bosses|boss]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion. It is encountered in the depths of the void after reaching {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}.  

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Boss Encounter==
The battle with the Voidling has 3 phases, largely similar to one another, with the Voidling having three starting attacks and gaining one extra attack per phase.

===Phase 1===
The Voidling will first appear once the player makes their way from the starting platform to the center ring of the Planetarium, attacking from the far side of the ring. It slowly walks around the ring throughout the fight.

====Primary: Homing Swarm====
The Voidling charges up for 2 seconds, then fires 5 multiple bursts of homing bullets every 0.5 seconds and a final end lag of 3 seconds. All of these durations scale with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]. Each burst contains 6 missiles fired in a 20º spread cone from the Voidling, homing in if a shot gets with 30m from a valid target. This attack can be very difficult to dodge, as hiding behind cover alone often isn't enough. Running directly towards the Voidling while dodging direct shots can be a good strategy, as near-misses are unlikely to curve sharply enough to deal damage.

Each homing missle travels at 70m/s, deals 30% damage with a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0, and flies for 5 seconds before disappearing.

The individual missiles can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds and holds 2 charges. The cooldown starts the moment the first burst of missiles is fired.

====Secondary: Laser Burst====
The Voidling charges for 1 second (scales with attack speed) and then fires a laser directly at its target 5 times at 0.4 second intervals and has a final end lag of 3 seconds. All of these durations scale with attack speed. Each laser explodes upon impact dealing 100% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0 in a radius of 6m with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot]] falloff. However, the last laser deals 200% and also leaves behind a lingering void pool which deals 80% damage with a proc coefficient of 0.5 in a 12m radius. It ticks 5 times per second for 45 seconds. The damaging patch can kill in mere seconds, so it is often necessary to find new cover after the attack finishes.

The void pool can be blocked by Captain's Defensive Microbots.

This skill has a cooldown of 10 seconds, which starts when the first laser is fired.

====Utility: Sweeping Beam ====
The Voidling lowers itself to just above the ground for 2 seconds, charges a beam for another 2 seconds, and then fires a thick horizontal beam with a radius of 8m. The Voidling rotates for 8 seconds, effectively rotating two full times and the beam aims progressively lower as the Voidling rotates. The beam pierces through terrain, so mobility is necessary to dodge it rather than cover. Being underneath or above the Voidling is safe.

The beam has a range of 400m, deals 133.33% damage with a proc coefficient of 1.0, and ticks every 1/30th of a second in its path. If the player remains stationary, they can be hit 5 times by it as it swipes across once.

Once done, the attack has a 5 second end lag during which the Voidling stands up again.

This attack has a cooldown of 40 seconds, counting from when it activates it.

==== Behaviors====

#'''Remain stationary''': the Voidling must be within 100m from its target. This behavior lasts for 2 seconds and cannot be chosen twice in a row.
#'''Use utility''': the Voidling must be within 200m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 80% health.
#'''Use secondary''': the Voidling must be within 400m from its target and have less than 90% health.
#'''Use primary''': the Voidling must be within 400m from its target and have line of sight.
#'''Strafe''': the Voidling must be within 200m from its target. This behavior is active for 2 seconds.
#'''Chase''': no requirements. This behavior is also active for 2 seconds.

===Phase 2===
The Voidling retreats into a void rift, and the Planetarium will fill with {{StatusEffectLink|VoidFogStrong|a stronger variant}} of [[Void Fog]]. The player has to follow the Voidling through the void rift, which will lead to a small platforming challenge through the void. The void fog will constantly damage the player until they travel through another void rift at the end of the platforming segment, where they will find the Voidling in a randomly selected arena for the second phase. Falling off this section will simply teleport the player back to the start of the challenge, usually without incurring fall damage since the teleport trigger is not very far below the level.

Throughout this phase and the next, the Voidling will be supported by [[Directors#Continuous|small monsters]] that have been captured in the Void, such as {{MonsterLink|Lemurian}}. In addition to attacking the player, these monsters are also hostile to the Voidling and vice versa, potentially drawing the Voidling's attention and luring away its homing attacks (although they likely won't last long under its onslaught).

In this phase the Voidling gains access to its special skill.

====Special: Nullifier Black Hole====
The Voidling rears up to nearly its full height for 3.43 seconds before opening up its entire body and emitting a telltale thunderous sound, revealing a nullifier implosion sphere similar to a {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|altText=Void Reaver's}} own death implosion. This attack is much larger, lasts 10 seconds, and at its apex has a radius of 50m. It also drags all of its enemies towards it with considerable force, which increases throughout the duration of the attack but does not scale with distance. Most deadly of all, '''''it is instantly fatal on contact'''''. 

Like other void implosions, this attack ignores {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Immune|altText=invulnerability}} effects, including [[Seeker|Seeker's]] unique [https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Seeker#Sojourn Sojourn] immunity, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} and can affect friendly creatures (for example, another Voidling if the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is enabled). Since it is a continuous attack that is fatal on contact, it also will kill the player again immediately after being revived by {{ItemLink|itemName=Dio's Best Friend}} or the {{ItemLink|Pluripotent Larva}}, effectively ignoring extra life items unless the player died right before the attack ends, or they have many extra lives to stall out the attack's duration. 

Strong movement speed is ideal for avoiding this attack, however it is also possible to get behind some terrain object so it gets put in the way of the attractive force. 

This skill has a cooldown of 60 seconds, which starts the moment the black hole sphere appears. 

==== Behaviors====
The Voidling gains one new behavior, which supersedes the rest in terms of priority.

#'''Use special''': the Voidling must be within 500m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 40% health.

===Phase 3===
The Voidling again retreats into a void rift, and same as before, the Planetarium will fill with [[Void Fog]]. The player must give chase through another platforming challenge.

For the final phase, the Voidling will not clear the void fog in the arena, and instead constantly projects a bubble around itself with a radius of 150m, similar to the holdout zones in the {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}} or {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}. Anything outside this bubble, including other enemies, takes constant suffocation damage. If the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} is active, the player must be inside the radius of ''both'' Voidlings' bubbles in order to avoid damage.

===Aftermath===
After the Voidling is defeated, the Planetarium's air becomes safe again and a large purple portal will appear. Entering the portal ends the game with a "Fate Unknown" screen similar to {{EnvironmentLink|A Moment, Fractured|altText=obliterating}}, albeit with a purple icon instead of a blue one.

Do note that in spite of the ending message, finishing the run in this fashion does not counts towards [[True Respite]] (obliteration ending) or [[Washed Away]] (moon escape ending) even if the player has defeated {{MonsterLink|Mithrix}} [[Commencement#Glass Frog|on their way here]], and will not give the player any of the related achievements. However this ending still counts as a win and if completed on [[Difficulty#Monsoon|Monsoon]] it will unlock the survivor's Mastery Skin, while the survivor's [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse Level]] will go up if the player is playing on the relevant game mode.

==Notes== 
*The Voidling has two weakpoints that {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Railgunner}} can take advantage of: one at the center of its eye and one on the back of its head.
*For Phases 2 and 3, the randomly selected arenas appear to be based on other environments in the game.  
**{{EnvironmentLink|Titanic Plains}}
**{{EnvironmentLink|Distant Roost}}
**{{EnvironmentLink|Aphelian Sanctuary}}
**{{EnvironmentLink|Abyssal Depths}}
**{{EnvironmentLink|Siren's Call}}&lt;!-- This isn't all of them, but I can't recall which other ones can appear. --&gt;
*A Voidling Ghost can be created on any phase if the {{ItemLink|itemName=Happiest Mask}} activates. If this occurs on the final phase, the ghost will project the same {{StatusEffectLink|VoidFogStrong}} effect that can still damage survivors, despite being on the same team. This can make it hazardous to get to the final portal if low on health, so it might be worth waiting for the ghost to die first.
* Entering the blue portal after phases 1 and 2 will trigger a huge burst of healing, capable of not only fully restoring a player's health but also completely filling their barrier if they have even a single {{ItemLink|Aegis}}.

== Tips== 
*Bringing lots of mobility items such as {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather|altText=Hopoo Feathers}} and {{ItemLink|Wax Quail|altText=Wax Quails}} is essential, as it will make both dodging the Voidling's attacks and chasing it through the platforming challenges easier. This is especially important for dodging its Nullifier Black Hole, particularly for short-range Survivors.
*If the player's total heath pool is reduced to 1 (Either from several [[Shaped Glass]] stacks, or from a really unlucky streak with [[Spinel Tonic]] debuffs), then they are functionally immune to the enhanced void fog, up to a certain point, as the health drain / damage ticks are percentage-based. You will still die from it if you spend too much time in the fog, as the percentage drain ramps up over time, eventually reaching the 100% threshold, which will deal the full 1 point of damage that kills the player.
*Multiple stacks of {{ItemLink|itemName=Newly Hatched Zoea}} can be highly effective at distracting Voidling and especially it's Homing Swarm Attack. The Void Allies spawned have large health pools which scale with enemy level, teleport to you if you are far away (thus allowing them to survive between phases), and spawn quickly with several stacks.  
**The most reliable method to obtain the Zoeas is to bring a {{ItemLink|itemName=Trophy Hunter's Tricorn}} and multiple yellow items to corrupt into the Void Locus, and kill a Void Devastator with the Tricorn.
**Interestingly, the Void Allies are not immune to the damage of the Void Fog.
*Due to the Voidling's immense height and the dangers of staying close to it, medium-range and melee Survivors will suffer against it. Long-range items and equipment are especially important for Survivors who lack ranged skills or the mobility required to get up to the Voidling's body. 
**{{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=TR58 Carbonizer Turret|altText=TR58 Carbonizer Turrets}} are unable to reach the damage point of the Voidling due to its height unless it rears downwards, putting him at a disadvantage.
*Voidling has a tendency to get stuck in one spot on the Abyssal Depths variant of {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}, which can be exploited to one's advantage. However, this isn't 100% consistent.

==Trivia==
*There is a unique ending associated with defeating the boss in the game's files, but it is currently unused.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArfnKisfApU&lt;/ref&gt;
*To date, the Voidling is the largest fightable enemy in Risk of Rain 2, and the second largest in the entire series overall, only being outmatched by the [[ror:Colossus|Colossus]] in the original [[ror:Risk of Rain|Risk of Rain]] and it's [https://riskofrainreturns.wiki.gg/wiki/Risk_of_Rain_Returns_Wiki remake.]
*During the platforming challenges, it is possible to look over and see the other possible platforming challenges in the distance since all are part of the same level. It is not possible to reach them, however, as straying too far from the current one will simply teleport the player back to the start of the challenge, just like falling off.
*In keeping with the deep-sea theme of the Void and the monsters related to it, the Voidling's visual design seems to draw inspiration from ocean life, especially crustaceans. The Voidling in particular bears striking resemblance to the [[wikipedia:Japanese spider crab|Japanese spider crab (''Macrocheira kaempferi'')]].
*Although the Voidling appears to walk, it is actually programmed as a flying enemy. Its main body flies around the arena, and its legs are purely aesthetic and simply "stand" on the nearest terrain; they even lack hitboxes entirely. This includes standing on the bounding boxes of the arenas.
*The Voidling performs its full spawning animation on every phase. However, this is only possible to see on the second and third phases if the player completes the platforming challenges extremely quickly.
*Much like Mithrix, the three stages of this battle are actually three separate entities with different scripting that just use the same model.
*By going straight from Stage 1 to the {{EnvironmentLink|Bazaar Between Time}}, followed by {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}}, {{EnvironmentLink|Void Locus}}, and finally {{EnvironmentLink|The Planetarium}}, Voidling can be reached as early as Stage 4, making Voidling the ending that can be reached in the fewest possible stages. Note that this is usually not actually the fastest possible victory you can achieve, as breaching the Cell Vents in Void Fields and charging the Deep Void Signals in Void Locus takes a while, and killing the Voidling usually takes longer than Mithrix too, so winning via defeating Mithrix is almost always faster than winning via defeating the Voidling.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corruption of the {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}}. 

When the holder attacks an enemy that is at full health, the enemy is struck with a fiery blast. The blast has a 12m ''(+2.4m per stack)'' radius and deals 260% ''(+156% per stack)'' [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|base damage]]. This damage suffers from [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot damage falloff]].


==Tips==
*This item's effect triggers 0.2 seconds ''after'' the initial hit, meaning this item won't benefit from {{ItemLink|Crowbar}}'s damage boost unless the triggering hit deals less than 10% of the target's health (including other instances of Voidsent Flame).
**Similar to the Crowbar, this item becomes harder to use with offensive drones and other players, as a single hit from anyone other than the holder will prevent Voidsent Flame from activating.
**Since [[Health#Barrier|barrier]] does not count towards full health, if an enemy has any barrier while being at full health, e.g., a [[Scavenger]] with Topaz Brooch and activating it with [[Scavenger#Secondary: Thqwibs|Thqwibs]], it is possible for the item to be triggered multiple times for the same target.
* Despite slightly reduced damage, this item can easily become more deadly to enemies in groups than {{ItemLink|itemName=Will-o'-the-wisp}}.  
**Instead of needing to kill one enemy, the player can simply damage any target to set off a chain reaction of explosions that can wipe out groups of small enemies and heavily damage or even kill larger ones.
**When paired with {{ItemLink|itemName=Gasoline}}, this effect is even more pronounced, as any enemies that die as a result of Voidsent Flame will also activate Gasoline and strengthen the chain. Afterburn from the Gasoline can even cause enemies to die after a delay, and potentially even trigger against enemies who weren't there for the initial wave of explosions.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Helfire Tincture}} can trigger Voidsent Flame's effect on ''yourself and allies''. However, the resulting explosions ''only damages enemies'', resulting in a huge damage boost as long as you stay at or above full health, which can be done using {{ItemLink|itemName=Repulsion Armor Plate}} and regeneration, {{ItemLink|itemName=Planula}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Topaz Brooch}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Aegis}}, et cetera.
**This combo is particularly powerful on {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}} due to her ability to counter damage from Helfire Tincture with barrier generated by her primary attack.

==Lore==
{{Lore}}

==Trivia==
* If the enemy that is about to explode manages to heal back up to full health in the 0.2 seconds before the explosion, the explosion can trigger a second explosion. Theoretically this could go on forever and apply stacking knockback to the enemy that sends it extremely far away, however no enemies come close to the regeneration necessary to pull this off and very few items could provide enough of a heal to them. The {{MonsterLink|Void Barnacle}} comes the closest with the highest base regeneration stat out of all entities, but only a level one {{SurvivorLink|MUL-T}} (The Survivor with the lowest base damage stat) and a level 99 Void Barnacle can pull it off, and it doesn't last forever.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items#Equipment|equipment]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access 'Skills 2.0' Content Update|Skills 2.0 Update]]''.

When activated, the player transforms into a fireball, which detonates for 800% damage after 5 seconds have passed without hitting an enemy or by using the interact key. 

While in fireball form, the player can fly but cannot use skills; they are forced to travel forward at a constant speed towards their crosshair and control their trajectory by moving the camera. Flying into an enemy deals 500% damage and resets the 5 second time limit, allowing the player to remain in fireball form indefinitely as long as they can keep hitting enemies.  

== Notes ==
* The player can only damage an enemy by flying through it one time per equipment use.
* The player ''can'' still be damaged while in fireball form, so use some caution when flying towards dangerous enemies.
* Due to the interruptive nature of the transformation, it is not recommended that the player use this item alongside {{ItemLink|Gesture of the Drowned}}.
** This also applies to {{ItemLink|Bottled Chaos}} randomly triggering the Volcanic Egg effect, though not much can be done to prevent this.
* This equipment's flight can be used to gain access to hard-to-reach locations, or simply to enhance the holder's mobility.

The '''Wake of Vultures''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

Upon killing an [[Monsters#Elites|Elite]] enemy, the holder gains that same Elite power for 8 seconds (''+5 seconds per stack'').

For more information on what powers each Elite type gives, see [[Status Effects#Buffs|Elite Status Effects]]. 

==Notes==

*It is possible to gain every single Elite power at once.
* The {{ArtifactLink|Honor}} makes this item more effective, with every kill granting the player an Elite power.
*Activating the {{ItemLink|Forgive Me Please}} while holding the Wake of Vultures will ''not'' give any Elite effect, even if the {{ArtifactLink|Honor}}  is active.
*Be wary that this item may interfere with healing-based strategies, as killing an {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixBlue}} or {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=AffixLunar}} Elite will temporarily replace half or all of the player's health with shields, respectively. Since shields cannot heal through normal means, this can be an unwanted nuisance for players who are in the fray often and require that healing to stay alive.
**However, getting the Overloading buff will also instantly grant 50% shield, even if the holder's current health is below 50% of its max. Similarly, getting the Perfected buff will turn the holder's health into shield and immediately grant 100% shield. In either case, when the effect ends, the holder is also healed for the amount of health originally turned into shields: 50% for Overloading and 100% for Perfected (regardless of how much or little shield the player had right before the effect expired). The {{ItemLink|itemName=Rejuvenation Rack}} increases this post-buff restoration, but items like {{ItemLink|itemName=Corpsebloom}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=N'kuhana's Opinion}} are not affected.
*Killing a {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Gilded}} Elite does not turn the player gold, but some kind white-gold combination. {{ItemLink|itemName=Aurelionite's Blessing}} actually makes the player have the same fire skin as the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Blazing}} Elites and the addition of this white-gold material on top produces the gold appearance associated with this Elite.
**This means if a player holds {{ItemLink|itemName=Ifrit's Distinction}} and they kill a Gilded Elite, they will turn gold due to the combination of the Gilded Elite buff and the Blazing skin.

==Trivia==
* The '''Wake of Vultures''' is a reference to the [https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Headhunter Headhunter Belt] in the ARPG Path of Exile, which has a similar appearance and effect.
**The order description is "Unique Leather Belt", which is the item type of the Headhunter.
**The tracking number "40***********" is likely a reference to the required level to wear the Headhunter.
**The estimated delivery "10/23/2056" is a reference to Path of Exile's launch date, October 23, 2013
**The shipping address "Auckland, New Zealand, Earth" is the location of the studio Grinding Gear Games, which develops Path of Exile.
**The quote in the shipping details is a paraphrase of the Lore/Flavor text on the Headhunter item card.
** The closing remark "It's incredibly rare." is a reference to the rarity of the Headhunter in Path of Exile, with many players going to great lengths to hold one some day.
**The internal name is "HeadHunter"

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Wandering Vagrant|returning]] [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] in Risk of Rain 2, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Jellyfish}} monster family. Being a Boss, the Wandering Vagrant may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

The Vagrant fires 6 orbs in a span of 2 seconds towards its target. These orbs travel at 80m/s and explode upon impact with a blast radius of 8m and a [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot]] damage falloff. The orbs can be blocked by {{SkillLink|skillName=Defensive Microbots|altText=Captain's Defensive Microbots}}.

The skill deals 6 x 400% damage and has a cooldown of 10s. Each orb has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

=== Secondary: Homing Orb Bomb ===
The Vagrant charges up a larger orb beneath itself for 2 seconds (scales with [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]]). Unlike the orbs launched in the Orb Volley, this orb moves slowly at 10m/s, but will home in on its target. The resulting explosion is much larger with a blast radius of 15m and a sweet spot damage falloff. This skill has an ending lag of 2 seconds, which also scales with attack speed.

This orb has 75 health, and as such players can attack and destroy it, triggering any [[:Category:OnKillEffect Items|on-kill effects]] they have. The orb will still explode if destroyed this way, so players should take care to attack it from a safe distance. After 12 seconds without an impact, the orb will self-explode on the spot. This attack can also be blocked by Defensive Microbots.

The skill deals 600% damage, has a cooldown of 12s, and has a proc coefficient of 1.0.

=== Special: Genesis Supernova ===
A large sphere of light emanates from the Vagrant as its body slowly brightens. After 4 seconds (scales with attack speed), the Vagrant creates a colossal explosion centered on itself, inflicting critical damage on any players or drones within an 80m radius. If the player can't run away fast enough, they can avoid taking damage by breaking line of sight with the Vagrant.

The skill deals 2000% damage, has a cooldown of 15s, and has a proc coefficient of 3.0. The explosion can knock the player with a force of up to 4000, depending on how close they are from the center of it.

=== Behaviors ===

# '''Use special''': the Vagrant must be within 60m from its target and have less than 25% health.
# '''Use secondary''': the Vagrant must be within 15-100m from its target, have line of sight, and have less than 95% health.
# '''Use primary''': the Vagrant must be within 15-100m from its target and have line of sight.
# '''Chase''': no requirements. Due to some of the following behaviors having a minimum of 15m of distance, if the player stands on top of the Vagrant's head, it may cause it to continuously fly higher in an effort to get "closer" to the player while not attacking. Likewise if the player manages to stand under the Vagrant, it will stay put, hovering over the player in an attempt to close the distance. Neither of these strategies will stop it from using its special ability when under 25% health though.

== Loot ==
''Main article: [[Genesis Loop]]''

If the Wandering Vagrant is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the Wandering Vagrant) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Genesis Loop}}.

== Tips ==
* It's advisable to keep a safe distance from Wandering Vagrants, at least until a decent amount of movement items are acquired. Besides the obvious danger of the boss' Supernova attack, it is difficult for survivors to remain unscathed by the Orb Volley when fighting up close, even if sprinting.
* It pays to have a good understanding of [[Environments]]. Similar to the {{MonsterLink|Stone Titan|Stone Titan's}} Eye Laser, the Vagrant's Supernova can be dodged if players are able to hide behind an object and break line of sight. However, unlike the Stone Titan, the Vagrant's airborne nature makes finding suitable cover more difficult, and its superior mobility may force players to adjust their positioning as the fight goes on.
*Although Vagrants remain almost completely stationary most of the time (given the long range of their attacks), they can still move to slowly follow a target that gets too far away. When they do, they can generally move unimpeded given how high above the ground they are, so fleeing from a Vagrant might prove deadly if there isn't enough cover to duck behind.
* It is possible for [[Survivors]] with enough mobility (such as {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}} or {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Loader}}) to stand on top of the Vagrant and attack it from above. This is a decent strategy, as neither the Vagrant's Orb Volley nor Orb Bomb can reach a target standing on top of it. However, it is recommended to keep at least one movement skill charged and ready, in the event that the Vagrant suddenly begins to detonate.
** This strategy is especially effective as Loader, as she will build up a considerable amount of barrier quickly. However, on higher difficulties this may still prove dangerous.
* As {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}, the Wandering Vagrant's Orb Bomb can be used against it. By using {{SkillLink|Laser Glaive|Huntress}} just as the Vagrant creates the orb, the glaive will rapidly bounce between the orb and the Vagrant itself. This will detonate the orb almost immediately and is an easy way of dealing decent damage to the Wandering Vagrant.

== Trivia ==
* The Wandering Vagrant's name may be a reference to the Wayward Vagabond character from ''Homestuck'', as the Wayward Vagabond is additionally referred to as "Wandering Vagrant."
*The Vagrant's Genesis Supernova attack may be named after the Pokémon Mew's Z-Move, which has the same name.
* Although the Wandering Vagrant may appear perfectly symmetrical, thereby making it impossible to determine where its backside is for the purpose of {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Bandit|altText=Bandit's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Backstab}} passive, this is surprisingly ''not'' the case. On the underside of the Vagrant's body, there is a small red triangle that indicates which direction it is facing.
** Additionally, like all teleporter bosses, the Vagrant will always spawn facing the teleporter, and it has one of the longest spawn animations in the game where it cannot attack (~8 seconds), making repositioning behind them easier as long as the player reacts in time.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|Item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Seekers of the Storm]]'' expansion.

During any boss event, missiles bombard the area near the boss dealing 2.5% (+2.5% per stack) of the boss' maximum health in damage exploding in an 8m radius with [[Damage#Damage Falloff|no falloff]]. At the beginning of each stage the player starts with 5 missiles and additional missiles can be obtained for every 50 gold gained, up to a max of 20 (+5 per stack). The gold requirement scales with [[Difficulty#Effect on money costs|difficulty]].

==Notes==  
*Boss events are considered any enemies that have a red health bar display, including [[Teleporter]] bosses (whether they are [[Monsters#Bosses|bosses]] or normal enemies due to a Horde of Many event), {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance|Umbras}}, and any of the [[Monsters#Special Bosses|special bosses]] with the exception of {{MonsterLink|monsterName=Artifact Reliquary}}.
**While the item's description does not explicitly mention this, War Bonds will also activate during any {{EnvironmentLink|Void Fields}} cell event and every 5th wave on [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]]. However, in this case the missiles do not deal a portion of the target's max health as damage, but 3200% of the player's base damage.
**Even though War Bonds does not activate for Artifact Reliquary, if the {{ArtifactLink|Vengeance}} is enabled, it will be triggered for any Umbras that spawn.
*The missiles never [[Damage#Critical Strike|critically strike]].
*The missles have a 0 proc coefficient, so they cannot trigger other items.
*If the boss or any valid targets are exterminated before all missiles have been fired, the remaining missiles will be fired at the player's location. This is an opportunity for the player to go near any target they want to damage so the range of the explosion will hit them.
**Keep in mind that this will also hurt the player with the {{ArtifactLink|Chaos}}, with possibly deadly consequences.
*At the beginning of the boss event, there is a 5 second grace period before the missiles start raining down, which they do so at 0.3 second intervals.
*If the boss is {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Captain|altText=Captain's}} Umbra, their {{SkillLink|Defensive Microbots}} will be able to block every other missile unless they have sufficient [[Damage#Attack Speed|attack speed]] for their microbots to recharge in less than 0.3 seconds.
*When an Umbra spawns with this item, they will have the 5 initial missile stacks. If the player then activates another boss event, e.g, Teleporter or {{MonsterLink|Alloy Worship Unit}}, the Umbra will fire its missiles at it but will not hurt it unless the Artifact of Chaos is also active.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Pocket I.C.B.M.}} does NOT affect the amount of missiles nor does it effect the damage from the missiles fired from this item.
*After the missiles have been fired, all of the stacks of the buff are reset. More stacks can be gained on the same stage by earning more gold, but no more missiles will be fired for the same boss event.
**Multiple barrages can be initiated on the same stage if there are multiple boss events, e.g. the multiple phases any of the final bosses.
*For 1 item stack, 20 missiles at 2.5% of the target's max health leads to 50% max health loss. In actuality, this will be only 41.6% max health because bosses have 20 [[armor]].

==Tips==  
*This item generally makes boss fights a lot easier, as the damage it deals is based on the maximum health of the boss.
* {{SurvivorLink|Engineer|Engineer's}} turrets also inherit this item. Ensuring all possible turrets are alive before the start of the boss event will lead to increased damage output even if the turrets cannot gain more than 5 initial missile stacks.
*Items that gain you gold, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Roll of Pennies}}, {{ItemLink|itemName=Ghor's Tome}}, and {{ItemLink|itemName=Brittle Crown}} are extremely useful for helping you gain additional missiles.
*{{ItemLink|itemName=Longstanding Solitude}} will interfere with the effectiveness of this item to a very noticeable degree. The player will always have access to the initial 5 missiles, but no more can be acquired because Longstanding Solitude intercepts any gold gained.

* While the item and its related buff were reworked in [[Patch v1.3.6]], it was only in [[Patch v1.3.7]] when their internal names were updated to reflect their new functionalities. Before this the item used to be called GoldOnStageStart.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] introduced in the ''[[Early Access Scorched Acres Content Update|Scorched Acres Update]]''.

When the holder activates their [[Items#Equipment|equipment]], they get the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Energized}} buff for 8s ''(+4s per stack)'', giving them 70% increased attack speed. 

== Notes ==
* Upon activating an equipment with this item, a distinct "ting" and a horn sound will play.
** This sound does not play if you activate your equipment while the Energized buff is still active
* This item works well with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Spinel Tonic}}, as the Tonic's stat boosts are ''multipliers'', increasing the 70% attack speed buff to about 120% instead. 
** If the player uses the {{ItemLink|itemName=Gesture of the Drowned}} to keep the Tonic's buff up constantly, they only need 4 War Horns to keep the Energized buff active constantly as well.
** if you are running a build based on any equipment, this item is highly recommended, especially if the build includes [[Gesture of the Drowned]].

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Warbanner|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

When the holder levels up, or when a [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]] spawns, a banner appears at the holder's location. All allies within a 16m ''(+8m per stack)'' radius of a banner get the {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Warbanner}} buff, giving them 30% increased attack speed and [[Movement Speed|movement speed]]. 

== Notes ==

* While the radius scales linearly, the area of the Warbanner's effect scales quadratically &lt;code&gt;(Area = π &amp;sdot; r²)&lt;/code&gt;. This means that in multiplayer, it is stronger to stack this item on one player rather than across several players. 2 players with 1 Warbanner each would cover 1,608.5 square meters, while 1 player with 2 Warbanners would cover 1809.6 square meters.

* The banner's area of effect is indicated by a large yellow sphere.

* The Warbanner works well for {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|survivorName=Engineer|altText=TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}}, since they cannot move out of the banner's area of effect and will always get the bonus attack speed.
** The {{PAGENAME}} is one of the few [[:Category:TurretBlacklist Items|blacklisted]] items that Engineer's turrets will not inherit.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2, introduced in the '''[[Seekers of the Storm]]''' DLC.

Whenever the holder takes damage, 20% of incoming damage taken is completely reduced and the other 80% is spread into 3 ''(+1 per stack)'' hits. All echoed damage is non-lethal besides the final hit and is applied one instance at a time every 0.75 seconds. The item recharges every 15s.

==Notes== 
*Removing all Warped Echos from the inventory does not cancel any pending delayed damage.
* Warped Echo does not intercept any delayed damage.
* If the original damage triggers [[Damage#One-Shot Protection|One-Shot Protection]] (OSP), this damage is capped to 90% before being further reduced by Warped Echo. Therefore, there is no issue where the damage being split into multiple instances performs worse than a single hit affected by OSP.
* The {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Permanent Curse}} from [[Alternate Game Modes#Eclipse|Eclipse 8]] is applied before the incoming damage is reduced by Warped Echo, so the number of Curse stacks the player is inflicted with is the same with or without this item.
*No damage information is passed on the delayed damage instances, except from being non-lethal, e.g., fall damage. This means [[Status Effects|status effects]] do not double dip, but [[Armor]] and damage blocking effects, such as {{ItemLink|itemName=Tougher Times}} and {{ItemLink|itemName=Safer Spaces}}, do.
** This means the damage from [[Shrine of Blood]] can be reduced by armor.
**The allocated red portion in the health bar which shows how much damage will be dealt by the delayed damage does not assume armor effects and can overestimate how much damage the player will actually take.
**{{ItemLink|Medkit|Medkit's}} heal is only applied when initially hit.
*If the reduced total damage is less than the number of Warped Echo stacks, only the necessary number of delayed damage instances will be dealt for the total damage.

==Tips== 
*{{ItemLink|Tougher Times}}, {{ItemLink|Planula}}, and {{ItemLink|Razorwire}} greatly benefit from Warped Echo since they can be procced multiple times for the same total damage received instead of the one instance without it.
*Due to armor effects double dipping, {{ItemLink|Repulsion Armor Plate}}, {{ItemLink|Rose Buckler}}, {{ItemLink|Jade Elephant}}, and {{ItemLink|Spinel Tonic}} can further mitigate the total damage received.  
**Skills that grant armor include {{SkillLink|Transport Mode}}, {{SkillLink|Power Mode}}, and {{SkillLink|Roll}}. Meanwhile {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary|Mercenary's}} utility skills and {{SkillLink|Step of the Brothers}} grant {{StatusEffectLink|Hidden Invincibility}} which if appropriately timed can negate an instance of delayed damage.
**Warped Echo has a bigger effect on [[survivors]] with base armor, while {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} gains 100 armor when in {{StatusEffectLink|statusEffectName=Void Survivor Corruption|altText=corrupted}} mode.
*Warped Echo has great synergy with items, equipment, and skills that heal, since the player can react before the whole damage has been applied if it would have been lethal otherwise.
* Warped Echo's reduced total damage means that even the 93% stack from the [[Shrine of Blood]] will not reduce the player's health below 25% health, thereby making it a consistent way to make the most out of these shrines while also holding any {{ItemLink|Delicate Watch|Delicate Watches}}.
** Note that for the 93% shrine hit OSP is active for the first instance of delayed damage which neutralises it. This means that for only 1 Warped Echo, where each delayed damage instance deals 24% damage, only a total of 48% damage will be dealt. This is less than the 60% damage that the 75% shrine hit deals in total. This effect is lessened the more item stacks one has as the damage dealt by each instance decreases and the player can only avoid the first one due to OSP.

'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Challenges|challenge]] in Risk of Rain 2. It is completed by completing the third stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]] without dying. Upon completion, the player will unlock the {{SurvivorLink|Bandit}} [[Survivors|Survivor]]. 

== Notes ==
* Dying and respawning with a {{ItemLink|Dio's Best Friend}} counts as dying and will invalidate the challenge.

== Trivia ==
* This challenge originally unlocked {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}}. Now that she is available from the start of the game, Bandit is unlocked upon completing the challenge instead.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is an [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2.

The item grants a 10m ''(+10m per stack)'' boost forward whenever the holder jumps while sprinting.

== Notes ==
* This item affects ''all'' base jumps a [[Survivors|Survivor]] has, but it does not affect additional jumps granted by {{ItemLink|Hopoo Feather}}.

* Since the {{ItemLink|H3AD-5T v2}} increases the holder's jump height, using it in conjunction with the Wax Quail allows the player to jump forward much further than the normal 10m per stack.

* Stacking multiple copies of this item can cause the player to launch off slopes unpredictably, due to how the game calculates momentum. This effect is significantly amplified by the H3AD-5T v2.

** Fixed immobilization from {{MonsterLink|Void Reaver|Void Reavers}} and {{SurvivorLink|REX|REX’s}} {{SkillLink|Tangling Growth|REX}} becoming permanent if using Wax Quail while affected, which would also sometimes lead to a crash upon getting killed

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Items#Void|void item]] in Risk of Rain 2, added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and the corrupted version of {{ItemLink|Bustling Fungus}}.

While the holder sprints, the item grants the {{StatusEffectLink|MushroomVoidActive}} buff, which heals the holder for 2% (''+2% per stack'') of their maximum health per second.

==Notes==
*The fungus heals 2 times per second, for 1% (+1%) health every tick.

==Tips==
*Weeping Fungus is stronger on [[Survivors]] who have the {{Keyword|u|Agile}} keyword on their skills, such as {{SurvivorLink|Huntress}} and {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}.
**Although {{SkillLink|Power-Saw}} doesn’t count as an {{Keyword|u|Agile}} ability, it can still be used while sprinting.
*Conversely, {{SurvivorLink|Engineer}} may want to avoid Weeping Fungus when using his {{SkillLink|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turret|Engineer|TR12 Gauss Auto-Turrets}}, as they are unable to trigger the item due to being stationary. However, it does provide strong healing for the Engineer himself.
**Although the Weeping Fungus may seem like a perfect fit for the {{SkillLink|TR58 Carbonizer Turret}}, turrets never sprint unless there is an extremely long distance between them and Engineer, making this item only effective on Engineer himself.
* {{SurvivorLink|Void Fiend}} will have difficulty transforming into its corrupted form with this item. Two stacks of Weeping Fungus provides enough healing to effectively lock Void Fiend in his uncorrupted form.
*Weeping Fungus is particularly effective in [[Alternate Game Modes#Simulacrum|Simulacrum]] as it allows the player to withstand some of the suffocation effects of [[Void Fog]]. Very few other items are able to heal you without damaging monsters.

The '''Wetland Aspect''' is a moist mire found on [[Petrichor V]] and is part of the second set of [[Environments]] encountered in ''Risk of Rain 2''. 

The stage consists mostly of ruined stone structures and swampy areas filled with water. It features an elevated cliffside, which may or may not be accessible by campfire.

==Interactables==
{{InteractableList}}

==Monsters==
{{MonsterList}}

==Altar to N'kuhana==
The Altar to [[The followers of N'kuhana|N'Kuhana]] is a secret area in the Wetland Aspect Environment.

The challenge [[Her Concepts]] is completed in this environment. Under the cliff on the map, there is a gap where the player can enter which leads through a tunnel to the Altar to N'kuhana. The Altar to N'Kuhana consists of a large hole with a yellow skeleton dangling above it. Destroying the skeleton will complete the challenge unlocking {{ItemLink|N'kuhana's Opinion}}.

Jumping into the pit below the skeleton will teleport the player back to the normal map area.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Newt Altars==
There are 3 possible locations for the [[Newt Altars]] and exactly 1 will spawn:
#In the deep water behind the smaller, large wall.
#Atop of the non-branch covered pillar near the center of the map.
#Behind a rock at the very end of the cliffside overlooking the map.
#*Normally accessible though a geyser behind a sometimes destroyed wall.

The egg was colorless, in a nest, and only on one of the main maps, not a secret map.  On April 15th 2021, after an hour of searching for it, Vulfoof became the first person to find the new easter egg.&lt;gallery widths="420" heights="240" class="nobackground"&gt;

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Ror:Will-o'-the-wisp|returning]] [[Items|item]] in Risk of Rain 2. 

1 second after the holder kills an enemy, a fiery blast spawns where that enemy died. The blast has a 12m ''(+2.4m per stack)'' radius and deals 350% ''(+280% per stack)'' [[Damage#.27Base.27 vs. .27Total.27 Damage|base damage]]. This damage suffers from [[Damage#Damage Falloff|sweet spot damage falloff]].

The explosion has a [[Proc Coefficient|proc coefficient]] of 1.0.

== Tips ==
* Stacking both Will-o'-the-wisps and {{ItemLink|Crowbar|altText=Crowbars}} can allow the player to rapidly chain together kills against grouped enemies, or at the very least inflict heavy damage.
** This is especially effective with the {{ArtifactLink|Swarms}} enabled.
* {{ItemLink|itemName=Ignition Tank}} does NOT work with Will-o'-the-wisp, as it doesn't apply a debuff. 
* Using the Will-o'-the-wisp with the {{ItemLink|itemName=Forgive Me Please}} allows the player to throw the doll at enemies for effective area damage.
* The knock-back effect created from the explosion can scatter targets, which is not only useful for crowd control, but can also send light airborne targets like {{MonsterLink|Lesser Wisp|Lesser Wisps}} and {{MonsterLink|Jellyfish}} crashing against terrain, dealing massive damage.

The '''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Monsters#Bosses|Boss Monster]] added in the ''[[Survivors of the Void]]'' expansion, and is part of the {{MonsterFamily|Construct}} monster family. Being a Boss, the Xi Construct may be encountered after initiating a stage's [[Teleporter#Teleporter Event|Teleporter Event]]. It can otherwise spawn naturally during higher difficulties.

==Environments==
{{EnvironmentList}}

==Skills &amp; Behavior==

===Primary: Xi Cannon===
The Xi Construct's front opens and after 1 second it fires a devastating beam at its target that deals 10 x 100% damage per second with a proc coefficient of 0.3 per tick. After 4 seconds the attack concludes by creating an explosion, which is indicated by a golden ring on the ground where the beam strikes. The blast deams 400% in a radius of 15m with [[Damage#Falloff Damage|linear]] falloff, with a proc coefficient of 0.0, a force magnitude of 6000 and a bonus force of 2000 in the y-direction. The attack has an end lag of 2 seconds.

BUG: (As of Seekers of the Storm, the Xi Construct beam will *not* explode at the end of its duration)

The Xi Construct can aim freely during the attack's duration, but the beam will slowly track and struggle to keep up with it unless at long range. It can still move back and forth horizontally to chase its target.

This skill has a cooldown of 8 seconds.

=== Utility: Xi Barrier===
The Xi Construct spawns 4 allied {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs}} on its corners, and then creates a golden spherical shield with a radius of 15m around itself that functions similarly to {{SurvivorLink|survivorName=Engineer|altText=Engineer's}} {{SkillLink|skillName=Bubble Shield|survivorName=Engineer}}, blocking projectiles (including hitscan projectiles) from the outside, but not those from the inside. The shield will stay up for 10 seconds and the Xi Construct will move but not attack for the duration; however, its {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs}} will continue to attack.

This can be countered by going inside the shield and attacking the Xi Construct from inside; however, this may be difficult with less mobile Survivors. Some abilities are capable of ignoring the shield altogether, like {{SkillLink|Strafe}}, {{SkillLink|M99 Sniper}} and {{SkillLink|Rebar Puncher}}

While channeling the Xi Barrier, the Xi Construct will face downward and slowly rotate to the side, with any Alpha Constructs currently mounted on its faces rotating along with it.

The shield does not give any defensive buffs; it simply creates a spherical boundary that does not allow projectiles to cross it or any targetting attacks to acquire a target past it.

This skill has a cooldown of 15 seconds (which does not begin until the shield has disappeared).

===Special: Tetra Alpha===
The Xi Construct spawns an allied {{MonsterLink|Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs}} on a corner, which supports it with additional firepower. After these are destroyed, the Xi Construct periodically re-summons them. There can be a maximum of 4 constructs on the boss at all times.

This skill has a cooldown of 4 seconds. It can store up to 4 charges, and it can only be used if there is at least one empty spawning location.

===Behaviors===

#'''Use special''': no requirements. This means upon entering combat the Construct will constantly summon an Alpha Construct as long as there is space and the skill is off cooldown.
# '''Use utility''': the Construct must have less than 50% health. This behavior cannot be used twice in a row, which is only relevant if the Construct has {{ItemLink|itemName=Hardlight Afterburner}}.
# '''Chase''': the Construct must be more than 200m away from its target. This behavior will be active for 3 seconds upon selection.
#'''Use primary''': the Construct must be within 150m from its target and have line of sight. This behavior cannot be used twice in a row.
# '''Follow''': the Construct must be more than 100m away from its target. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Strafe''': the Construct must be within 30-100m from its target. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Flee''': the Construct must be within 30m from its target. This behavior will be active for 0.5 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row.
#'''Stop''': no distance requirements. This behavior will be active for 2 seconds and cannot be selected twice in a row. This means that if all skills are on cooldown (or currently in use) and the target in within 200m, the Construct will alternate between a behavior from 5-7 for 0.5 seconds and standing still for 2 seconds.

==Loot==
''Main article: [[Defense Nucleus]]''

If the {{PAGENAME}} is the [[Teleporter#Teleporter Boss|Teleporter Boss]], there is a 15% chance for the {{Color|uncommon|Uncommon}} [[items|item]] (that drops as a reward for defeating the {{PAGENAME}}) to be replaced by its {{Color|boss|Boss}} item, the {{ItemLink|Defense Nucleus}}.

==Notes==
*Unlike many other enemies, the Xi Construct does not have a collision hitbox, meaning that players cannot stand on it. This may make it difficult to fight them as melee [[Survivors]] such as {{SurvivorLink|Acrid}} or {{SurvivorLink|Mercenary}}.
*Xi Constructs will constantly try to put distance between themselves and the player, but generally will not make any attempts to get ''closer'' to a target. Attempting to chase them down will often just cause them to retreat further, which may prolong the Teleporter Event by a significant amount, especially if the player lacks long-range damage.
* Since the Xi Construct continually summons 4 weak allies that are attached to it, on-kill items like the {{ItemLink|Gasoline}} and {{ItemLink|Will-o'-the-wisp}} are extremely effective against it.
*A {{StatusEffectLink|AffixVoid}} Xi Construct will not spawn Voidtouched Alpha Constructs. However, the Alpha Constructs will still fight alongside the Voidtouched Xi Construct.
**In the reverse scenario, in which an Alpha Construct stationed on the Xi Construct becomes Voidtouched, the Xi Construct will attempt to attack it.
**If a Xi Construct becomes Voidtouched while there are Alpha Constructs stationed on it, the Alpha Constructs on it will fight the Xi Construct.

Usage:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Lore}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Uses the pagename to return the lore, can also specify a specific lore entry to return, like so:
&lt;pre&gt;{{Lore|Abandoned Aqueduct}}&lt;/pre&gt;

Data for the lore is found [[Module:Lore/Data|here]].

It was easiest to just push them off the edge of the plateau. \r\n\r\nNot a minute later, we heard a deep rumble - and saw something unbelievable. It just... flew. One of the stone rings - a smaller one - began to groan and lift out of the earth, moving with unknown forces. And then it lifted into the air, slowly spinning. It hovered to a height of about 200 feet, and then stopped.\r\n\r\nAs it spun, something began to form in the center of the ring. Specks of dirt tumbled in the air, until it formed a pebble, then a small rock, then a boulder. An identical boulder to the one we just moved - created out of thin air. Despite being constructed only a moment ago, the boulder was worn and covered in moss and lichen like it has been around for centuries.\r\n\r\nThen, the stone fell to the ground with an unceremonious crash - right on top of our coms relay.\r\n\r\nNot too long after, the stone ring began to waver. Then, like the invisible strings holding it in place were cut, the ring also fell to the earth.

But I couldn't convince him otherwise, and he was so crazy - so crazy! He wouldn't shut up and the golems were coming and the dagger - there was no choice.\r\n\r\nEveryone was real somber that night.

Got dinged up by another unit in the charging bay that malfunctioned after another power surge. We'll be checking that one out after this. You can thank the electrical crew for that,\" Hiroshi remarked. \r\n\r\n\"Great. How hard is it for them to just keep things stable? They have robots doing 90% of their job anyway.\" Rico scoffed.\r\n\r\n\"We've got complaints on this unit about poor welding jobs, which might've been the cause. Optical calibration is probably off, so we'll also be taking a look at that while it's here. I'd still put money on it being electrical not keeping up with maintenance. Hey, Rico! Would you put that down and help me out?\"\r\n\r\nThe rail brought a bright yellow robot, slumbering, into the hangar.

In a few minutes the robot was on the service platform.\r\n\r\nHiroshi walked over to one of the tool cabinets and pulled out a strange device. He popped open the access panel to the unit's dented head, and began probing at the damage from the opposite side. In no time at all, the tool beeped and kicked back violently. The dent was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Go put this away while I fix the optics,\" Hiroshi said, one arm stretched behind his back, device in hand. \"I have something I want to show you in a sec.\"\r\n\r\nRico grunted and took the de-denting tool back to the cabinet. Hiroshi was already soldering away with the iron from his pocket.\r\n\r\nThis caught Rico's interest. \r\n\r\n\"You don't need a soldering iron to fix the calibration. What are you doing?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I already fixed the optics. Remember when I said I wanted to show you something cool - the next time we got a MUL-T in the shop? Come here.\" said Hiroshi, gesturing. \"You see these two chips? It\u2019s actually just one chip that's been split. MUL-T\u2019s come with the same cores as those fancy chef bots, but they cut off access to the main learning module.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say,\" Rico responded, still trying to see the chip Hiroshi was talking about. \"Why'd they do something like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's cheaper to just make all the cores the same way at the factory and alter them later. The manufacturer says it's for safety, but they just use it to sell you the new cores every few years instead of letting you just teach the units to do a new job.\" Hiroshi explained.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds about right. If it were a safety issue, why don't they do the same thing with the chef bots? They've been super stable. Can't say they've even ever got an order wrong, even if it's totally out there. They even managed to get Ma's Squid Risotto right.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's what they can get away with. Anyway, that should do it. We'll just sneak a few minutes with this guy. Wake up,\" he commanded.\r\n\r\nThe robot's relaxed posture disappeared, and it stood fully alert.\r\n\r\n\"Hey pal, you see this thing I'm doing with my hand? Can you do that?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot mimicked a rude gesture.\r\n\r\n\"That's fantastic! You're doing great!\" Hiroshi was excited, and Rico got a devilish grin. He rushed off to his desk. Hiroshi continued repeating the gesture, and the robot continued mimicking it back with its single functional hand. Rico stepped back into the robot's view, with a picture covered in holes. \"Can you remember this man? This is Ron from corporate, and he's a total degenerate.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot beeped in affirmation.\r\n\r\n\"Can you do that next time you see this man?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot beeped in affirmation again.\r\n\r\n\"Rico! He's gonna remember that! MUL-T, forget that.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot did not respond.\r\n\r\n\"What are you two up to now?\" said a grating voice, clearly approaching from no discernable direction. In a panic, Hiroshi slapped the access panel on the unit's head closed and covered its optical sensor.\r\n\r\n\"Just fixing up robots! Doing our job! In fact, we just finished with this one. You're good to go, pal!\" Hiroshi exclaimed to Ron, slapping the robot on the back. The machine folded up neatly into itself and began rolling down the hangar's exit lane.\r\n\r\n\"I see. I'd better not catch you two slacking again.\" Ron said sternly, before turning around and making his usual relieving exit \u2013 most likely to pester other workers on his route.\r\n\r\nThey both let out a sigh of relief. Rico stood up. \"Well, we're due at the site in about\u2026 13 hours. That's enough time to grab that MUL-T, pop it back open, and reset it.\"\r\n\r\nHiroshi also stood up. \u201CYeah, I\u2019m not too worried. How much trouble could it cause in 13 hours?\u201D\r\n"

I have assigned their common name as \u2018Worker Beetle\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 About the size of a small cow. Quadruped, with two large front-limbs. Moves similar to an earthen gorilla. Five eyes.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Beetle has two armor-like chitin plates on its head and back, presumably for defense. It seems to secrete a waxy substance.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Beetles appear to be social in nature, with a hierarchy I cannot discern. I witnessed a group of 4 beetles resting under a tree, when a stray fifth came around. They promptly sprang up and repeatedly head-butted the creature until it left, battered and bruised.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tharson has reported to me that the Beetles are highly aggressive and territorial. \r\n"

I have assigned their common name as \u2018Beetle Guard\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Much greater in size than their smaller cousins, the Guard is the size of a rhinoceroses. The Guard has the same 5 eyes as the Worker's, with one of them protruding from the top of its head. This most likely allows the Guard to see while keeping its head down in a defensive position.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Guard appears higher in the social hierarchy than the Worker. I have witnessed Workers scatter when a Guard appeared.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The Guard\u2019s chitin plates extend to cover its entire body, with only joints revealing the thinner, darker exoskeleton below. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Tharson has reported that the Guard\u2019s chitin is significantly sturdier than the Workers. We have consumed many resources to fell this magnificent creature, including our disposable missile launcher. Tharson\u2019s battle with the Guard lasted for about an hour before it finally succumbed. Amazing! Tharson is OK from this encounter."

We've attempted to kill him once in the hopes of restoring our access to the portal, and it ended in such disaster that it became clear there could not be a second attempt.

They greatly resemble Medusozoa from Earth. \r\n\r\n\u2022 They seem to be experiencing neutral buoyancy in this planet\u2019s atmosphere, causing them to float. I theorize this is due to a unique gas composition inside of their hull, which they expel to traverse.\r\n\r\n\u2022 When observed, these Jellyfish seem to bathe in the sun, slowly rotating their bodies as they do so. They may be cold-blooded.\r\n\r\n\u2022 By my request, Tharson approached a lone Jellyfish. After detecting his presence, it began to glow, quiver, and pulse before suddenly detonating with a brilliant flash and a loud bang, causing severe burns and temporary blindness to Tharson.

Again, and again.\r\n\r\nSo, I figured out its pattern.\r\n\r\nI waited for it, where it would appear next. My rifle was aimed at empty space - and then suddenly, that empty space became a target. But I couldn't pull the trigger. \r\n\r\nIt turned to look straight at me, and I was paralyzed. It wasn't fear, it was something else. It was talking into my brain. The words it used weren't any language I knew, but it compelled me to freeze. The experience wasn't something I can fully describe with words. I couldn't pull the trigger. I couldn't even reach for the radio. I couldn't turn to look away. While my head was ringing, it resumed its routine; I could only stand and watch. It finished its check, and then returned its attention to me, as though I were an afterthought. I could feel it take something from me, but I can't remember what it was. And then, it left.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that it got whatever it wanted, because it hasn't been back since.\r\n\r\nSomething is still wrong with my head. I can't even seem to work up the power to speak. Should I even tell anyone? Is knowing somehow worse?\r\n\r\nAnd what about all those times I heard that same sound - before I ever came to this awful place?"

We stepped away to observe this lifeform\u2019s behavior from afar.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Parent\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Tall, lumbering giants, eerily humanoid. Where you would expect to see a face there is only a hole, giving a blank look to them. Their ghostly skin appears to run like wax but even so it does not seem to congeal at their feet.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Their large hands have opposable thumbs. This could possibly mean that they have the capability for intelligence, using tools or testing their environment with dextrous manipulation.\r\n\r\n\u2022 If we hadn\u2019t taken up this vantage point when we did, the creature would have been upon us before we realized it. Its distant footstep sounds betrayed how quickly it closed the distance.\r\n\r\n\u2022 I had Tharson throw a stone near the creature and suddenly any signs of intelligence faded, replaced with primal fury. Deadly, wild force rained down as it smashed the ground with its fists, searching for the perpetrator of its peaceful moment. Our ship was not OK from this encounter.\r\n"

Thinking we would take some samples back to test if they were edible, we noticed some of the smaller variety sprout up from the ground and circle around us.\r\n\r\nI will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as \u2018Mini Mushrum\u2019.\r\n\r\n\u2022 \u2018Mini\u2019 is a relative term here, as these mobile mushrooms were larger than Tharson. The subtle glow on the underside of their cap is probably to scare away predators, advertising that they are dangerous to eat.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Waddling around on short, stubby legs makes them seem quite unsuited for walking. They comically bump into things as they fret about. Perhaps their eyeseight is poor from living in the dark?\r\n\r\n\u2022 After a long time studying their movements, I suggested to Tharson to retrieve a sample from one to take back with us. The one that the sample was taken from began to flee as the others began shaking, spilling their spores into the air. Our air filtration warnings went off so we left before the cloud of fungal gas became too overwhelming. We did not eat the sample.\r\n"

I have assigned her common name as \u201CBeetle Queen\u201D.\r\n\r\n* Just like other insect queens, the Beetle Queen dwarves her subjects. However, her size is much greater than it should be for an insect queen. Does this mean that the Queen herself hunts rather than sending her drones?\r\n\r\n* The Beetle Queen issues orders via pheromone emission. Merely being in the presence of the Queen gave the air a sickly sweet aroma, and Tharson reported light-headedness and trouble thinking clearly.\r\n\r\n* The Queen\u2019s bile is incredibly acidic, clocking in at a whopping 0.05 on the pH scale. Immediately upon exposure to a test sample of steel, it began to dissolve and spew noxious fumes. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\n* The Queen is able to summon unique Beetle specimens that can fly. These drones do not appear anywhere else on the planet \u2013 do these drones act as attendants to the Queen?

I have assigned its common name as \u201CIcarian Vagrant\u201D.\r\n\r\n* Massive in size. I wouldn\u2019t believe the Vagrant is capable of flight had I not seen it myself. Like its smaller cousin, the Vagrant\u2019s hull contains buoyant gases that allow it to fly. \r\n\r\n* These gases are easily excitable and produce incredible amounts of static electricity, cloaking the Vagrant in a protective aura that scorches anything that approaches. The Vagrants can also hurl charged nematocysts as a method of self-defense, as evidenced when I asked Tharson to approach a lone Vagrant. Tharson is OK from this encounter.\r\n\r\n* The name of \u201CVagrant\u201D was decided on by its nomadic nature. We trailed a lone specimen for several days. The Vagrant would wander from place to place, occasionally dipping down towards the ground to feel around with its tentacles. After a few minutes, it would ascend and continue on its path. Could the Vagrant be looking for something, indicating intelligence, or is this merely a hunting method?\r\n\r\n* When the clouds part, dozens of Vagrants can be seen lazily drifting throughout the sky, twinkling like stars. Despite their beauty, it raises a horrifying question \u2013 are the stars at night on this planet truly stars, or just more Vagrants? The answer can spell truly horrifying implications for our stay on this planet."

I have assigned their common name as \u201CMagma Worm\u201D.\r\n\r\n* Upon inspection of its (now dead) body, I discovered multiple ports along its skin. These ports must allow it to propel itself forward, releasing a gaseous exhaust that is then ignited to give the worm its fiery appearance.\r\n\r\n* The size of the creature is something to behold. It must wield an incredible amount of energy, as the heat radiating off its body was enough to turn the earth it burrows through into smooth, glassy tunnels. It must either eat an incredible amount of food, or spend a long time hibernating under ground.\r\n\r\n* The worm\u2019s body is incredibly conductive, retaining temperatures of over 350 degrees Fahrenheit for over ten hours after the beast was felled.\r\n\r\n* It appears that the worm is classically blind \u2013 what appear to be eyes are revealed to be symbiotes that grant the worm vision in exchange for protection against predators.

I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.\n\n---------------------\n\n Tharson and I had been tracking a group of small, rodent-like fauna for some time. They are hostile on sight, but we hope to follow them back to their dens and observe their behavior when not hunting. I have assigned their common name as \"Radkari Blind Vermin\".\n\n* As their name suggests, the Vermin are blind, relying primarily on their acute senses of smell and hearing to navigate their environment.\n\n* They leave behind trails of body waste as they scurry to and fro, and other Vermin follow these trails, much like Earth ants' pheromones. Could these creatures be descended from insects?\n\n* The Vermin are weak individually, and thus live in communal dens, typically buried in hillsides or foxholes.\n\n* Their terrible odor cannot be understated. Even through our suits' filters, we could still smell a foul odor, reminiscent of rotting flesh and excrement. I will not have Tharson disable his filters, despite my curiosity."

Their major difference, of course, was their ability to fly! I have assigned their common name as \"Radkari Blind Pest\".\n\n* Much like their earthbound cousins, the Pests are blind and rely heavily on their smell and hearing. However, their pronounced tongue may indicate that they may use taste to identify things as well.\n\n* The Pests' primary characteristic is their ability to fly. Alongside this, they also weaponize their acidic bile as a projectile attack. This could allow them to partially digest their prey as they hunt... How fascinatingly foul.\n\n* They typically inhabit warmer, damper areas, like jungles. After our skirmish, I noted nests in the canopy. This indicates that the Pests are ambush predators, waiting for prey to waltz below their nests."

Through its vessels the Tar spread, consuming its homeworld entirely. But the Tar still hungered.\n\nRiding down on a falling star, the Tar spread to the unsuspecting world of Aphelia.\n\nThe Tar offered its power to the dunepeople, promising them energy and sustenance. The dunepeople, hungry and battered from life in the harsh desert, accepted.\n\nThe Tar didn't ask for much. The Tar only asked that the dunepeople spread it across Aphelia, so the Tar may feed. And so it did; the dunepeople crafted elaborate clay vessels to carry the Tar to and fro. Mighty aqueducts, belching forth black rivers of Tar, dotted the skyline. Those who pleased the Tar were blessed with its gift; a connection. They were one with the Tar.\n\nAnd it was in this reverence that the dunepeople began to look back. The lush riversides, consumed. The animals that served as livestock and steed, drowned in Tar. The Tar had consumed everything, even the dunepeople themselves. They were nothing more than extensions of the Tar's will.\n\nAnd when the Tar asked for more, the dunepeople had nothing more to give.\n\nOnly a mighty hero, riding down from heaven on a glowing blue dragon, offered the dunepeople a chance at salvation. Desperate, the dunepeople took to the hero's arms, and began their exodus to paradise.\n\nAnd the Tar continued to spread.\"\n\n- Tragedy of Aphelia"

Following the scent brought us to a large gelatinous mass, which seemed to sense our approach and lurched forward towards us. I have assigned their common name as \"Gup.\"\n\n* Seems to be a largely single-celled organism, similar to the Earth Caulerpa taxifolia. When endangered, it can quickly perform mitosis to split into multiple smaller, cognizant beings.\n\n* I had Tharson tackle the creature to test its viscosity. Tharson, upon impact, was stuck to the beast and was briefly submerged in the Gup's slime. Tharson was left mostly unscathed from this encounter, though is reporting signs of dizzyness.\n\n* The Gup's slime is intensely aromatic, smelling much like strawberry and other fruits. Could this be a hunting tactic, luring prey in, only for them to be stuck in the Gup's slimy trap?\n\n* I had Tharson taste-test the Gup's slime, for science. Tharson reported an intensely bitter flavor, despite the pleasant aroma. Tharson is vomiting after this encounter, but is largely OK."

Analyzing the life cycles of these creatures will certainly be a fun endeavor. I have assigned their common name as \"Forhamian Acid Tick.\"\n\n* The Ticks' biology is dominated by a bile sac, which not only stores acidic bile but also houses their eggs.\n\n* When threatened, the Ticks produce bile at an accelerated rate, filling their bile sacs to burst - literally. I've noted some specimens capable of producing blasts of acid with a range of up to 3 meters in diameter.\n\n\* When they burst, their acid provides an avenue for newly hatched larvae to bury into prey and feast on their nutrient-rich meat.\n\n\* Their acute senses prevent predators from sneaking up on them. On top of this, the creatures exhibit automimicry, their false head spewing acidic bile onto would-be attackers, leaving enough time for the Tick to escape."

One by one we were scanned, and we were made to present all we had with us:  Feathers from local species, masks from strange spirits, abandoned metal scraps and rusty old equipment.  It examined each individually, its iris flexing mechanically as it traced the silhouette of every artifact.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I snapped out of it.  I felt fear.  I wanted to scream out, to raise my weapon, but my body was wholly resistant.  Suddenly, the others all turned their heads to face me from across the circle, their eyes wide and faces expressionless.  I felt a sharp pain in my chest and my neck stiffened.

* The data for descriptions is in [[Module:Skills/Data]], and the function is in [[Module:Skills]]
* The color param should never need to be used, as it will default to &lt;code&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/code&gt; if unspecified
* Notes is intended to be used as a bullet list

==Examples==
Code:

Produces:

| type          = Primary
| cooldown      = 
| proc          = 2x 1
| notes         =

Code:
&lt;pre&gt;

* &lt;span style="color:#FF69B4"&gt;Description correction:&lt;/span&gt; Deals 220% damage.
